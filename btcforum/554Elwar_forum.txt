Best way to pay off a nation's debt "using crypto" is this:Create a national cryptocurrency (or just use Bitcoin).Get everyone to use it for everything.Stop using the old national currency.Print trillions of the old currency and "pay off" the debt. Also, that money is useless for those that just got paid off. I have some 1inch. I took a bunch of ETH I had sitting around and turned them into shitcoins to see what this DeFi was all about. 1inch is essentially a DEX coin used as the middle currency for trading a bunch of other currencies. It will go back down, it's not meant to gain much value over time.I re-iterate that had I kept my shitcoins in ETH I would be better off even with some shitcoins getting over 150% returns (as their price continues to drop). And had I kept that ETH in BTC it would have even more value.When BTC dips they dip much quicker. When BTC goes up, they go up quicker. The key lesson learned with playing around with DeFi is that the ETH gas price is way too high. I've paid $500 in gas fees to set up a trade. But it gives me hope for when we can do it all on the Bitcoin LN using RGB at almost zero fees. ETH and all of the alts will go away. You know how when random relatives contact you and ask about bitcoin that it's about time to start considering selling?I got asked my a distant cousin "what do you think about dodge?". Not looking good for Taproot. Is there some sort of downside that the miners are wary of? I suspect that as the vaccines roll out there will be ample housing. And likely a huge shortage of wheelchairs. The elderly tend to die...shouldn't change the housing market. They've been doing so for a while now.  A clear sign of a global pandemic with people dying left and right is a housing shortage...  I agree, most libertarians come at the problem from the perspective of making it happen where they live. It does need to be proven at the small scale first (outside of historical proof such as Iceland for 400 years). I think the Blockchain city ( https://www.blockchains.com/ ) can give a good start if it can get people to move there to start testing things out. Asking people to voluntarily stop watching the TV doesn't work. You're right about the "free riders" ruining everyone else's life by not cooperating. Anyone who uses Bitcoin should understand consensus. If it is consensus to use systems such as decentralised justice systems then those will be used instead of involuntary extortion schemes.I would hope that people that by now, with Bitcoin having proven that a voluntary system is possible, that people would accept that such a system can be used for more than just money right?It's completely lazy thinking to rely on extortion to pay for things. It's time to re-think that little piece of our "civilised society". It is like defending slavery as people are just finally realising that hey, maybe this is the wrong way of getting our food...maybe we can do better.You are defending extortion...just remember that. I voluntarily pay my Bitcoin private fees to use their service.I do not expect ETH users to pay Bitcoin fees to use their service.It's....voluntary....aint that great? If civilisation is built upon involuntary extortion...it's not really civilised is it? I've always supported the concept of a communist seastead (progressive/socialist/green, whichever fad name is being used at the time).I think it would be best to have them try over and over and over and over and over and over again and fail over and over and over and over and over and over again. But they would fail with people that are voluntarily joining them, so it's their choice. No reason to force it on those that don't want it.Though, in reality, I have argued that just about any governance structure will work with a community of less than 150 people or so. Early Christianity was communist, they all had a higher purpose for which they were living such that it trumped their own desires (outside of the desire to build a church based on Jesus's teachings). The community was regulated by culture and social norms which could be regulated at the individual level.Trying to scale it just ends up with USSR, sending people to gulags and shit. Or Cambodia and mass executions. Trying to force people to worship some higher purpose even if they don't believe in it (but you do so you think you're doing the right thing making them conform).It works if it's at a small scale with everyone agreeing. Trying to centralise it all is what destroys it.Decentralise all the things. Localbitcoins is alive and well in SK. I used to get my local cash in Seoul from time to time. David Kleiman disappeared exactly 8 years ago. Yep, Ford was definitely a fascist supporter.If he was around today he'd be making all of his workers wear masks to demonstrate his dominance over them. I have been looking into the feasibility of such a thing a lot lately. I believe Saylor has looked into it in depth as well as I noticed that he mentioned some of the numbers on energy loss on transferring over distances.I believe it would require superconductor technology close to room temperature for it to be feasible but I think the implications of such a thing would be awesome.Imagine having a thumb drive with 10kWh on it that you could transfer 1kWh to someone in a few seconds. Something that you can take home and plug into your house and have a night's worth of energy or get paid for 2 weeks of work and it gets transferred to your car which you can plug into your home and top up your hot wallet as needed.This would encourage advances in energy storage and creation. The world would be abundant in energy such that we could have a lot of very advanced technology, translating very well into moving into space. Even such that people mine space for energy with more efficient generation closer to the sun while transferring energy back to Earth.The only thing standing between us and that type of currency is technology. Technology that advances yearly at an exponential pace the closer we get to it.As for the whole meat thing...I suspect that the media is working in overdrive as they support the NWO plan on getting us all to eat cockroaches. I just can't believe that people on this board are spouting off the propaganda as if it's all true. People who know how much they lie about Bitcoin and still believe their lies about meat. It's a damn shame. Maybe the media has been too kind to Bitcoin...it was perhaps a better filter when it was being attacked as just being used for drugs on the darkweb. Agreed.I was able to get out of debt by essentially becoming a monk as far as owning anything goes. I minimised the things I owned down to 44 items (counting each piece of clothing as an item). I made sure I was flexible enough to take any job anywhere in the world that paid more than what I was currently making. Moving often (easy to do when everything you own fits into a carry-on and backpack).I know this is next to impossible with a family but if you're single it can be done (and stay single as long as you possibly can...get a new girlfriend when you're out of debt, then get a new girlfriend every million dollars...also, avoid having a girlfriend). Nope, I saw on the Interwebs that they were all crisis actors and that they were just cardboard cutouts set up by the lizard people in skinsuits.  I heard they're putting a full Bitcoin node in the next shots. More decentralisation. Be your own bank. Literally.
Looks like Bitcoin is dead.Time to go fight in the war. Your sleeping caused the dump.Why did you take your eyes away from the charts?!? They have literally said they will let inflation get out of control. "we'd rather deal with the consequences of a bubble popping than try to prevent it". The Fed is now saying that they're going to allow inflation to happen for a temporary period...Just like the 2 weeks to flatten the curve... Theft: the illegal taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of anotherTaxation: the taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of citizensIt's ok when the government does it.Also "safeguard the freedom of the citizens of the country"...umm...you don't really believe that bullshit do you?Please...when in the history of the Universe have governments safeguarded freedom? Seriously...nobody cares one bit about freedom, believe me I've tried to be free but run into nothing but roadblocks from...guess who?...governments and their order followers. They're just following orders. #TEXIT It appears that this technical challenge is being overcome by the development of RGB.I have also learned that many countries are trying to figure out how to have their own crypto currencies based on Bitcoin becoming a bit more mainstream. I do not doubt that within the next 4-5 years there will be some nation in the world that adopts a cryptocurrency or allows it for payments of government services.This strategy would give the nation a transitional period while also providing them the huge benefits of a currency with DEX, smart contracts and fast low fee transactions.I have spoken to some people here in Panama that are open to the idea (Panama uses a national currency pegged to the US dollar). The government started working on a cryptocurrency during the pandemic when they were giving out food vouchers to people, they wanted to have the cryptocurrency used for the vouchers accepted at all of the grocery stores.We already have stablecoins in Tether, DAI, USDC and others so the idea is not too foreign. Having a stablecoin using the Bitcoin Lightning Network that eventually transitions into the nation using bitcoin as their currency would be even better. It looks like they plan on inflating the dollar to trash status, in so doing they would eventually lose Panama as a nation using their currency. And Panama would then prosper with a currency that doesn't purposefully lose value over time (they really get screwed by using the dollar, the US prints the money and spends it while Panama's currency loses value). Lessons from my past shitcoin purchases:Converting from Bitcoin to ETH:If I had kept my ETH in BTC the value of my coins would be higher.Converting ETH to DeFi shitcoins:If I had kept my DeFi shitcoins in ETH the value of my coins would be higher.So:BTC > ETH > DeFi shitcoins All Doge stuff is due to Elon Musk.I sort of feel bad that when the Robinhood thing happened I told my family to get their money off of there. My sister had bought some Doge for some random reason. She was like "at least I made some money on that Doge thing, I bought it at 2 cents, now its worth 3 cents". Not to toot my own horn but.... They didn't censor all of the Internet...so...there's that... I certainly haven't spent 8000 hours on this. I hardly paid the whole thing any attention over the past year instead focusing on the likelihood that the government was full of lies and that industries like the cruise ship industry would collapse due to the whole "2 weeks to flatten the curve" being a lie. So I spent my time planning on buying a cruise ship at scrap prices.Just like I didn't spend hours going through Bitcoin's source code even though I'm a software engineer but I know it is the solution to the horrible governments destroying government currency.I would say it's more like 8000 hours of expertise in the government overstepping their power at every opportunity as opposed to any sort of knowledge of vaccines. I don't see how "this time they're looking out for us". If there is some evidence out there that the government has somehow suddenly become benevolent then I'm all ears. This is what I was wondering early on in this whole thing. When they roll out the vaccines how do they choose between the elite who live and the lowly scum that die. When brainstorming this with a friend we wondered if there would be separate vaccines but that would likely require too much coordination and thus leakage of information.It doesn't really make sense to have a deadly vaccine that is given to everyone who supports the state, leaving only those that don't trust the state. So, unless Bill Gates is a closet libertarian that's been playing the long game for decades it just wouldn't work. My only thought is that they assumed that everyone would get the vaccine and they didn't consider that their propaganda wouldn't be believed. The military is going door to door in some locations vaccinating people so it makes sense that they thought that they would vaccinate everyone.Reading more into the actual mRNA drug it appears that it may just be profit driven. Get everyone to trust the mRNA medicine which actually does have the possibility of being a miracle drug which cures disease, cancer and anything else. This makes a lot more sense. A lot of very rich and powerful have invested heavily into this technology and they need it to work. How better to prove it works than to inoculate people against a disease that kills only .002% of people (while claiming it kills billions), ramp down the PCR test threshold and voila...success! A lot of rich people get a lot richer and they can move forward with their new drug with full public confidence.Which would mean that it really doesn't matter if you take the vaccine or not. They just need people to believe that the vaccine is what stopped COVID.The way the propaganda was framed early on I think they had planned on having the vaccines ready last year. But they ran into trouble so this whole "pandemic" has been drawn out soooo looonggg...It feels like chatting with one of those random scammers online and you know they're a scammer but they're not getting to the "send money to me part" so you have to go through their whole game to finally get to find out what their scam is (if you're bored enough to keep talking to them). You know it's a scam, they know it's a scam but it's just taking much longer than necessary. There's really no point in calling out their scam because they have plenty of experience in scamming that they'll have an answer for anything you throw at them. So you just wait and wait, playing along. Some people got tired of playing along, protesting and such but nobody really cares. They were ready for that...calling those people extremists or whichever.Either way, I'm glad it's finally almost over. The end goal of getting the vaccine out there is happening so they'll make their money and we can all move on with our lives. Eventually I'll need a car, and all I have is bitcoin.So...the last time I needed to buy a car I was selling and the local guy I sell bitcoin to was doing the buying.At least doing it directly I save the 3% fee. I followed one of the source links in that article going down the rabbit hole of looking into Moderna's history and it certainly does not inspire confidence in their mRNA approach.Going back to scientific articles in 2019 Moderna was still facing problems getting things working (they began taking on billions in investment dollars back in 2011). They had just begun human trials in 2017 for this completely new approach.So a year before getting the green light to start producing millions of vaccines they were having problems with their delivery system. And somehow we're supposed to believe that they got it all cleared up in a year (after spending a decade trying to get it to work).Don't get me wrong, I hope their novel approach works but I personally would not take it until at least a decade of testing. If you think nobody has died from the vaccine or COVID after the vaccine you're really going to be shocked by the VAERS data (over 2300 deaths so far, while this Harvard study estimates only about 1% of people report to VAERS).Or the nunnery where all 35 sisters were never in contact with anyone, they got the vaccine then 2 days later they had a COVID outbreak that killed 2 of the sisters with 28 of them testing positive. I feel so strange, I paid $11k for my current car. Almost every car I buy is at least 10 years old...by buying a 10 year old car I get the same feeling up getting upgrades every time I buy my next car.But with Tesla accepting bitcoin I want to buy a Tesla, but if it's a battery technology I know that it makes sense to buy a new car. So the Tesla I'd like to buy is over $100k. I can certainly afford it. But it's such a huge leap. The first house I bought was nice, had 3 acres of land and only cost me $85k. I just can't imagine buying a car that's more expensive than what I'd pay for a house (don't get me started on the prices of houses right now...).Reminds me of the inflation rate throughout my career. When I started work in the late 90s the Social Security cutoff rate was just above my salary around $45k. My last job in the US the Social Security cutoff was just above my salary around $90k. Which means that throughout my whole career I really never truly got a raise. I just kept up with inflation (which is the point the Keynesians make about making workers think they're making more money). Great write up, I feel like WO is maturing to the point of people putting in hours of time to make quality posts (ie. the custom comic strip based on someone's dream). This thread is a hidden gem of the Internet and I hope nobody else finds out about it.I would add to your post that the first Bitcoin wallets included a button for mining. That was eventually split out into separate layers. Definitely, it was a one day thing to knock out COVID so all was well. I was under the supervision of my friend who lives on Vitamin C research. She gave me her super fancy stuff that's supposed to absorb better or whichever. Either way, I went from my lungs feeling like when I was in high school after running a 100 meter sprint (after the slightest amount of activity) to being completely fine.I think there is something to the Vitamin D thing though. They are finding people with higher melanin are dying at higher rates than those with lower melanin levels. Lower melanin level folks tend to process Vitamin D easier. Though, anecdotally my wife is melanin enhanced and she was just fine...just a little tired those days. Though she's more apt to walk around outside than me.
I read this morning that the reason the price jumped was a tweet by Musk saying "moon soon". I was never vaccinated as a child. It wasn't until I was made to take them in my 30s to go to Iraq that I got my first vaccine.I wouldn't really call the COVID jab a vaccine. Moderna wasn't calling it a vaccine when they developed it. They considered it gene therapy. But then they found out they can get out of liability if it's called a vaccine so...*poof*...it's a vaccine.They just started testing this mRNA approach on humans in 2017 for flu.While I think the mRNA therapy may be something that can help with future illnesses, I remember my mom telling me growing up "don't try any new medicine unless it's been out on the market for at least 10 years". Sound advice. Though the reality is that I can count on one hand the number of times I've ever taken any medicine.You can all be the guinnea pigs for this new medical procedure but I'm fine focusing on a natural healthy body that can take on anything. I already had the COVID, it lasted about 2 days. The second day when I realised what it was I took Vitamin D and Zinc in the morning with 1g of Vitamin C every hour. It knocked it right out.  You mean one of the only nations in the world that didn't follow the NWO WHO recommendations? No celebrity or politician (except those that came out against COVID) died from COVID.Now they're dying from the vaccine. At least those that didn't fake getting the vaccine on camera.CNN/MSNBC Legal Analyst, Midwin Charles, 47 I bet it magically breaks ATH the day before the Coinbase listing. On Coinbase at least.  Here's my post warning people about "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose" when the price was $325.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=843822.0 Bitcoin as stable as it has been for the past month is not very indicative of the top of a bubble.We're building a floor. I was thinking the same thing. Even if we disagreed I hope he's ok. I watched it not realising that I'd seen the first one and that this was an expansion of it. Other than Superman coming back I didn't remember the last one. Then I had to go down the rabbit hole to figure out what that other movie was that I'd seen where they brought Superman back. But it kept telling me Justice League...which I'd just seen but I could swear it was years ago. I remember reading a conspiracy about how things we remember from the past are no longer part of this timeline. I tried to look up that conspiracy but I can no longer find it. Did I remember something that was scrubbed? One of them was that nowhere in Forrest Gump does he say "life is like a box of chocolates". But we all remember that.Edit: The Mandela effect Bulls wins. Welcome to the club.The only advice I can give is...every project I have invested in since I retired would have done so much better if I'd just kept it in bitcoin. lol, I just got banned from r/communism for posting:I love you guys!This is the best subreddit ever. I am selling all of my fNFTs on the ETH blockchain as wrapped fNFTs (wfNFT) which I have then put on Binance as Binance wrapped ETH fNFTs (BwfNFT).Minimum bid: 1 BwfBSV I used to get about $20 when selling blood in college for food.Well, plasma...actually about $25 the first time, then it goes down because they can't get as much plasma from you on following days... I'm pretty sure the star registry ensures that if humans ever travel to that solar system that my family has full ownership of any light coming from that sun and everyone will need to pay us for access. Along the lines of the NFTs, my dad registered a star for the family about 20 years ago. Guess how many billions of dollars that's worth now.NFTs are pretty much the same thing. There are several private star registries. Sure, you can't own your favorite star in one registry so you can just go to the next registry and register it. Or you can create your own registry and own all of them. Same thing with NFTs. Someone can buy Elon Musk's first tweet on X blockchain and nobody on that blockchain can own that tweet. But they can go onto Y blockchain and buy that tweet. It's all a matter of consensus and wether or not people will all deem one blockchain as the place where the true NFTs reside. Otherwise will be many different ones and it will all become useless.Most things in society are about consensus. That article a few pages back about yuppy elite business majors not understanding Bitcoin doesn't make sense to me. My thought about accountants and business majors all downplaying Bitcoin is the fact that they don't understand consensus. They are trying to dictate consensus. Even if they all think it's just Beanie Babies and there's no real value to it, would not the smart accountant see the Beanie Baby craze early on and understand that humans being what they are will start buying these things at a fast pace and try to profit from the window of opportunity that exists? My accountant poo pooed my support of Bitcoin back in 2010 as "a virtual currency backed by nothing? no thank you".I learned during the dotcom boom about the difference between something that is superior vs something that people want. I was doing modeling and simulations of communications protocols. I was to compare these two protocols to determine which was the better routing protocol. I spent weeks constructing the models and simulating different scenarios and running the protocols through their paces. I determined that one was far superior. That was my first foray into investing, I put about $1000 into the company that had come up with the superior protocol figuring that once people realise how far superior it is in distributing data that the company would take off and I'd make a bit of money.The reality is that the inferior protocol was adopted for whatever reason and I watched as my $1000 investment crashed to a few dollars that I pulled out about 2 years later.So these accountants think that they know everything about money and believe that the dollar is far superior to Bitcoin so they believe that there is no way that the dollar would lose to Bitcoin. But the smart accountants should realise that it is the consensus of people and the choice of what people will use as their currency that matters. If they were truly intelligent they would take into account the large distrust people have of the government that is growing by the day, they'd see how the dollar is becoming shit, even if their religion tells them it is for the greater good, they'd see that this is a technology that people are very interested in and are starting to trust more than their government currency. If an accountant cannot see these externalities and just compares dollar to bitcoin, then they aren't that smart are they?As far as NFTs, ICOs, etc. while the underlying premise may be wrong or flawed, if there is consensus behind something then it will certainly gain in value. I remember telling my brother to stay away from Ethereum when it was under $2. I still don't recommend ETH but I would have never guessed that it would have come this far back then. For any shitcoin with a centralized team that makes bank in an ICO to create the protocol, if you truly support it and love the idea, just copy it and release it anonymously without the upfront costs.Though, I do support LBRY and use them as an alternative to Youtube. They jumped through all of the hoops in the US and still got hit. It's like here in Panama where the government and police will try to get bribes from you. But all that means is that you're willing to give bribes so they'll just keep coming back.If I was them I'd dissolve the original company and open a new company to move on with everything.Not that I would do anything like that with...say...a cruise ship company...On an unrelated note, for every new venture that you pursue, create a new company for it, and try to separate assets in different companies (in different nations) as much as possible.Also along those lines, some wise advice I was given: Don't live in the nation of your citizenship, and don't keep your money in the nation where you live or your nation of citizenship. Ya, I won't need to do any interviews until the book comes out. Still working on it. We get requests for interviews all the time and the ones that aren't MSM I turn over to the CEO of Ocean Builders so he can talk about the cool tech of the SeaPods and not need to bring up politics. We're just building houseboats, no need to bring up politics.One interesting tidbit, while I was on the run giving interviews, one of the reporters questions wanted me to comment on Trump. Their obsession over Trump was so intense that they wanted to somehow figure out a way to bash Trump in a story about some dude fleeing the Thai navy. I just responded focusing on the fact that Trump was a real estate investor and how our floating home project would have been great for the Thai economy. They definitely didn't use that answer in their article. A reporter from The Economist wanted to interview me about the Thailand thing. This headline re-assures me that I made the right decision to turn them down.At this point any reporter in the MSM wanting to cover the story is looking to attack us. No reporter's going to write a feel good story about how we got away and started over somewhere else.  What if it looks like she's waving one leg back and forth in front of her?
No need to think that way.Many people don't think "I had fiat in my bank account" and regret that decision.Or, "I bought a car 5 years ago instead of bitcoin", or "I put money into my 401k instead of buying bitcoin".Make Bitcoin your primary currency and you won't regret spending it. It's all you have to spend. Well, it looks like the blockchain is now being used for evil.New York launches nation's first 'vaccine passports.'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/03/26/covid-vaccine-passports-new-york-first-vaccination-proof-system/6976009002/As I began reading the article I was trying to figure out how to get my name into this system, then I saw the blockchain part. I'm sure each hospital will need to sign a message with their private keys to get the data onto the blockchain.Oh well, I'll just have to go the Panama way on getting a freedom pass. I bought this for 12 bitcoins back in 2015.Then again, every paycheck was converted to bitcoins so I was 99.99% bitcoin. It's all I had to spend.Some people kept fiat currency in their bank accounts instead of converting it to bitcoin. Classy, certainly worth 10 BTC.The french adds a certain....je ne sais quoi. duckduckgo still uses Google's search results. They just don't use it to spy on you.I've tried other search sites, it's true that they're missing a lot. I even considered setting up my own crawler to crawl sites I'm interested in as I figure eventually Google will start filtering out sites I'm interested in. Holy shit!"There Should Be A Public Cache Of The Web"Facebook did not take on MySpace by saying there needs to be a public social media.Offer something better than Google. Stop whining and just do it better. Don't ask the government to help you. Several years ago proudhon had the highest or second highest post count on the forum. In a time where Musk was likely working on building a rocket ship and electric car business so I doubt it is him. So...now that the bitcoin price has some ties to the stock market due to ETFs and companies getting involved it may react at times to the same things the market reacts to in the short/medium term.One thing I have been keeping my eye on that most people aren't talking about is this:https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/fed-to-end-covid-19-capital-break-it-gave-wall-street-banks/ar-BB1eL21ABack around September things got a bit crazy.Every bank must have on hand at the end of the night, X amount of dollars to cover their accounts. In order to ensure that they comply with this regulation there is a simple loaning structure where if a bank is a bit low that night they just borrow it to cover the amount. One day it happened that many banks did not have enough funds and thus the interest for the loans shot up over 10%. An unprecedented amount, usually it's less than 1%.The Fed stepped in and ended the regulation temporarily. Banks did not need to keep reserves to cover their accounts until an undisclosed future date.That date has arrived. At the end of the month the change expires and banks have to go back to how they were.This is making the market nervous...what will happen on April 1st? Nobody knows. Will the banks have enough to cover their accounts?Any rally will likely be postponed until April 1st as everyone waits.Biden is coming in like a knight in shining armor promising to blow $3 trillion on some bullshit so bitcoin isn't going away any time soon. It works for me on all models, once I configured it and get to the payment I do have card and BTC options, works with every model apart from the top model S, which has a mid-2022 delivery.And yeah, I'm using a VPN as I'm not in the US.[/quote]VPN appears to be the key. Works for me now. I had to set VPN to the US to get the Bitcoin option. Even after choosing US as the location. I get the same thing...no bitcoin option. Unfortunately you do. The Tesla you buy is the same as converting to dollars.I won't join the chorus of IRS sympathisers and try to scare you into paying such a tax though. Do what you want.Unfortunately by posting this I'm outing myself to the IRS that I understand taxes such that buying something is equivalent to selling it. Which I do pay taxes on so no big deal, but when it comes to taxes if you do not understand that you are breaking the law then they can only get you on civi penalties as opposed to purposeful tax evasion which is a criminal offense.Ignorance of taxes is actually a good thing in such a situation. And it actually makes it so that you do not have freedom of speech considering if you post something like this and later get accused of avoiding taxes you cannot claim ignorance as they then point to your post showing that you had the knowledge.Either way, taxation is extortion. The best way to avoid taxes is to live outside of the country and make less than $100k per year in income or live in the US and take out less than $70k or so in capital gains with no income (as a married person). Not that I would know much about that...Also, stop voting for people that openly extort you. Seems legit. I'm open for the equitable trade of NFTs. I'm not one to brag but the value of my post went from zero to an officially appraised value of almost a satoshi so....ya, it's kinda a big deal.The percentage appreciation is somewhere around infinity. Close to 1 satoshi...that's a bold statement sir. Bob is single handedly turning around the bitcoin price with his merits. But I am greedy.I was going to sell the post for 100 BTC but I figured I'd be realistic. It's a good post...but not THAT good...Still waiting for offers of similar quality posts. Merits improve the value over time. Hence the long term investment returns. My contribution to the world of NFT:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5325734.0 I'm selling this post as a NFT.Bids starting at 1 BTC. (I am willing to trade for a post of similar value.)
I looked into what it takes to actually buy a country.What it basically boils down to is buying up the nation's debt or as much of it as possible, funding certain candidates and then leveraging that debt to get what you want from the politicians in charge. A big part of it being the relief of some debt in exchange for some policy changes you may want.So some small country like Nicaragua could be bought, then you have them pass pro-liberty policies in exchange for restructuring their debt. Pass enough pro-liberty policies and the whole system goes toward freedom and they have no way of stopping it.Similar to how China is making countries become communist through similar means. The reality of the picture is that the guy would stand in the front. Get whipped. People in the far back would stand up cheering the guy on, yelling at the whip guy. The guy in front keeps getting whipped. The guys in the back continuing to cheer...Revolution! Yay!Guy in front gets whipped more and more until finally he collapses.People in the back go back to kneeling ("see, I told you he should have stayed down"..."what was he thinking?"..."he should have waited until we voted for a new whip guy"..."I, for one, welcome our whipping leader"). The link you posted is literally the same link I posted.    You've never heard such a beautiful birdsong than a bird screaming for its life as it rips off its own feet to get off of a tree limb.Why do they have to ruin everything!?! This dude almost had the same idea as me.I was going to fart into a jar and sell it as an NFT.https://nypost.com/2021/03/18/nyc-man-sells-fart-for-85-cashing-in-on-nft-craze/ This. Get a brain wallet and freeze yourself.I have a friend in the transhumanism movement that was telling people to buy just $100 worth of Bitcoin when the price was around $1. Telling them they can keep their Bitcoins in a brain wallet and there would be incentive to revive you. He listened to his own advice and bought a lot more than $100 worth at $1. Now he is working on the next step of being able to be kept frozen for a long time. Without interference from governments...which is part of the point of making seasteading happen. The next phase will not be televised. Save your bitcoins. If you want to start digging into the next big thing for Bitcoin I suggest you check this out:https://www.rgbfaq.com/NFTs, Smart Contracts, DEXs, etc. on the Bitcoin lightning network.It will require patience, and the first implementations will be like the early days of Bitcoin where you need to know what's going on under the hood to get things to work. Initially. Functional basic wallet is expected by this June or July. QFT Great news! Someone upgraded the Bitcoin protocol to allow for the purchase of NFTs!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmFjmvwPGKU Bitcoin had NFTs for about a decade. They're called colored coins. There was even a collectible card game created.What am I missing. Why are people thinking NFTs are new? I found his discussion on Bitcoin essentially being the transfer of energy interesting because it looks like he's definitely looked into the concept of transferring electricity over large distances.I believe that the best future currency will be energy. Ideally such that you have something like a thumb drive in your pocket, you walk into the store and plug in the drive and it "charges" a few seconds and now they have $50 worth of KWh. You can buy and sell over the mesh network and when you get paid you either just get it automatically uploaded to your home charger or whichever.Of course I have to say the future because there are all sorts of hurdles of physics to deal with as Saylor touched on with loss of power over distance and such. I think that once superconductors reach room temperature this would be one of the applications. They have just discovered some twisted pair carbon superconductors that are fairly promising.If, instead of miners just burning power to create BTC there was a rush to create energy such that the planet is filled with abundant stored energy...it would be useful toward our move into space. The tulip mania inflated in what fiat currency?How many people are using that currency today?How many people are buying tulips today? 1 BTC = 1 BTC2 print BTC3 goto 1 So I watched the whole hour plus video because it was a good talk...you're right he gets it.I'm not criticising his view but I am certainly in disagreement on some of his points. I think one of his major points is that all of the billionaires in the world will be moving their wealth to bitcoin due to its excellent ability as a store of wealth. I won't jump into the "store of value" vs "currency" debate as that has been fought tirelessly, I have always seen it as both but if people are ok with it being a store of value without the ability to use it as a currency then that's all good. I always assumed that it would not be seen as valuable without the ability to spend it easily. Hence my interest in the lightning network and making it easy to spend your wealth.He also focuses on the fact that corporations, billionaires, etc. won't really care if they have to follow KYC/AML guidelines if they are placed on Bitcoin because they're already doing that for all of their assets and they don't really care. Adding that it may even make Bitcoin even more valuable as it gets more regulated.Of course, that's where it rubs me the wrong way. Though I am open about my bitcoin spending and have nothing to hide, if you look at history there are several examples where being able to hide wealth and what you do with it from the government. I use the example of...what if the jews had bitcoin under Hitler's reign. They could have used OpenBazaar to order weapons, radios, their families that escaped could have sent them funds from overseas, etc. To blindly trust that governments having full knowledge of your finances should be ok over the next 100 years requires ignoring the past 100 years. Of course, the technology of Bitcoin is moving toward full privacy of transactions so that's a good thing. Get all of the money into Bitcoin then make it a privacy coin. Too late for the tyrants to put the genie back in the bottle at that point. Biodom listed some resources a few pages back. I factored in $50k as the top about 3 years ago when I put my sell order in.So I went from about 99.9% BTC to about 95% BTC at that price. When you know the bitcoin price is going to the moon and all you have is bitcoin but the price is $6-7k and you have rent due or you're borrowing someone else's car because you don't want to sell multiple bitcoins to buy your own car knowing that those bitcoins are going to be worth so much more very soon...it kinda sucks. Now I have enough for the next cycle so I'm good.I like Saylor's talk about borrowing against your bitcoins so you never have to sell. I'm going to work on that over the next couple of years to be ready for any big purchase I may want in the future. Unfortunately I'll be paying the capital gains for this year's sale. I really hate paying taxes, I've been able to avoid it by only selling under the zero tax rate per year but I think borrowing will be a good way to do it from now on.  Don't mind prodhon. He's an old school troll that was on here early enough that he likely threw in 1000 bucks when the price was $1/BTC on a drunken binge or just for the lols.After being super rich he realised that being rich is not fun if you have no friends. Craving any human contact after being away for years he fired up his wall sized computer screen with direct neural interface to connect to bitcointalk to troll once again. To make up for how lonely his castle feels when there's nobody there but you. Bitcoin bouncing around this summer between $100k and $250k would be fun. I am quite happy to be wrong about the price going down over the next few years. I have no buying or selling to do for several years anyway so I am just watching with joy the higher it goes. Looking forward to $100k for easier conversions of sats. If every country in the world is inflating their currencies then a single state holding a strong currency could become the next world economic powerhouse. An island of happy commerce surrounded by a sea of despair and keynesian economic destruction.
I like this concept as well. They get it right with the shape. Anything above water needs more weight at the bottom than the top. When we calculate the width of our platform on top of the spar we have to take into account someone at the highest story walking to the edge, then factor in the tilt factor. For us we consider a dinner party where 4-5 people of average weight goes to one side of the highest point. We figure a tilt of less than 5% is probably reasonable.If it is shaped like a pyramid or a cone then you can have wider bottom floors. I have proposed a design that looks sort of like a wedding cake which would allow you to go stand on the balcony which is the size of the floor below you. They are expensive to maintain. As Elon Musk showed, you can buy one for about $3-4 million which is fairly cheap. Oil companies are fine with using them because they're pulling millions of dollars up from the ground every day so flying a helicopter to the rig or other expensive ways of getting on there and taking care of provisions, etc. are covered. As I learned by owning a cruise ship, you need a lot of income to maintain these huge beasts. The oil industry and cruise industry have a lot of money flowing in to keep these things on the water.Someone actually bought one and turned it into a hotel. At least they tried to. Turned out to not be very popular and now they're looking for donations and volunteers to keep things going. https://fptower.org/That's the ideal. Fish farms, etc. We're working on putting hydroponics in our homes, theoretically you can live off of microgreens but it takes a lot of time and they're not that tasty. There's no need to give up on the international market just because you live a little further from the store than you used to.Here's our speech at Anarchapulco last year on what we're working on here in Panama.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxrsSI90OBA The laddie reckons himself a poet! "The value of Bitcoin fell"Then came back within like 10 minutes. Congratulations CFTC, you made a blip.You can pretty much assume that the US government is "investigating" pretty much every aspect of the crypto market trying to find a weakness. That's why you don't put your money on a centralised system that the US government can get its dirty hands on. You all need to turn in your Pink Floyd fan cards if you missed this reference.https://youtu.be/YR5ApYxkU-U?t=68 Repeat after me : An acre is the area of a rectangle whose length is one furlong and whose width is one chain. More acres for training your killer bees to attack race cars. "Go fast or get stung" The PCR test, whose inventor said it should not be used to detect a virus, just multiplies whatever you are trying to test for. Essentially they go through cycles to multiply whatever is being tested. Too high of cycles and they pretty much come out positive almost every time. At 40 cycles they pretty much come back positive almost every time. The CDC was requiring PCR tests with 40 cycles up until Biden was inaugurated when it was lowered (and what do ya know, cases started going down)."Tests with thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from infection that pose no particular risk  akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has left""Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive, agreed Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. Im shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive,"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.htmlI will have to trust you on the anal swabs.I've been able to avoid getting tested so far. I opted out of visiting my own cruise ship because Panama required that I get tested to go onboard. Screw those guys, I wasn't willing to add to their numbers. The key is that it's really difficult to estimate the price of one of the super megastructure seasteads. I will give a word of advice if you ever consider investing in a seastead project. Only put money in if it's going directly to pay construction workers building the actual thing. Everything else is just paying a bunch of guys to sit around in meetings, paying for marketing, paying for trips to various sunny locations, etc. I put way too much money into seastead projects where this was all that was done.At Ocean Builders I keep pushing the founders to not spend money on marketing or people just sitting around theorising (the founders are not paid salaries, we put almost every bit of our investment into the factory, the materials and the workers). Everything we spend money on, I remind them how much that will push the price of the individual home up for the final buyer. And we are trying to make these affordable. I know of 4 projects right now. One is a super megastructure that has been burning through millions of dollars over the past 5 years coming up with designs, lawyers, negotiations, meetings, etc. They appear to be hoping that someone will be willing to pay over a billion dollars for one of their units. They are not trying to do anything political, just sell luxury homes. I will not endorse this project as it does not seem viable.Another is focusing on floating wave breakers that create energy from the waves. They're approaching it practically, working with a government under the premise of protecting the shores of that country while creating energy. They are self funded with a couple of guys out on a big research vessel trying out their technology. I hope they do well.Another is a small scale floating home like Ocean Builders but theirs can take some rough waves, built so waves could go over them and they'd still be ok: https://ventivefloathouse.com/Ocean Builders https://oceanbuilders.com is focusing right now on manufacturing and sales. We're a bunch of engineers that haven't manufactured anything before so it wouldn't make sense for us to start building and selling seasteads in middle of the ocean. Instead we're taking a phased approach, starting with just what is essentially a "houseboat" that will be like a luxury floating home in a beautiful anchorage in Panama, anchored right next to dozens of other anchored boats near a marina so there's really no legal or new lifestyle we need to create from scratch, there are already people there living in the water. This will allow us to get the process of building floating homes down before expanding into deep water versions. The deep water versions will just put the living portion of the home on a new spar built for different seas. But we're likely a few years from being anywhere other than the small anchorage we're at right now, and most people are not willing to move to Panama just to live in a floating house so we'll be focusing mainly on local investors. We already have plenty of demand, now we need to get production up to meet the demand. This would be the key. If you could somehow make the currency attributes specific to that state then people would be encouraged to use it. Like, maybe it's a POS token where there is a rewarded amount given out to every citizen of the state every transaction or some sort of distribution based on property or something unique to that state (oil in Texas, Uranium in Utah, etc.).The USD is a world reserve currency but it is being destroyed. The latest $2 trillion stimulus bill is being used as a weapon against states, tying contingencies to accepting the funds to states such as not allowing them to lower taxes, encouraging them to raise taxes, etc. The Federal Reserve is run by the Federal government and if the individual states keep using the dollar they will lose their independence as the Federal government just needs to print out more dollars to bribe the states into centralising power. If the states want to take their sovereignty back they need to take their currency back into their own hands.Sure, taxes could be paid in USD. Just like when I charge up my phone card on bitrefill with bitcoins. I don't use dollars but the phone company gets dollars. The USD could just be some unused accounting currency for dealing with the government while everything else is in crypto. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution enumerates several powers to Congress including:To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures;To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States;Article 1, Section 10, Clause 1 of the US Constitution limits the powers of States, including:No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit (emphasis added); make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.As it stands right now, states do not accept gold or silver coin as payment for debts. The Federal government does not coin money.This is all done by a third party, Federal Reserve. So why would a state not be able to use a third party crypto created specifically for their state by an anonymous "Satoshi" type?I recall one push long ago in Iceland where someone created an Iceland currency, they sent X amount of coins to every registered citizen of the country (at least, they made it available to be claimed).Something similar could certainly be done for a state. The key would be setting it up so businesses and individuals could use the currency within the state fairly easily.It appears that the US Federal government is ok with destroying the dollar. If a state wanted to protect their economy from going down with everyone else they could start using another currency.Even if it's required to accept USD for taxes, there could be a single exchange for paying your taxes with the new local currency such that you never even touch a dollar.Any thoughts?*Self Moderated due to franky1 likely thinking that a simple question is me trying to pass some "get rich quick" scheme. Even though every project I have invested in since getting involved in Bitcoin has left me with much less money.  I remember hearing about it as a kid around the camp fire when it was time for scary stories. My brother is in Texas, it was a bit of hot potato with the kids going to stay with whichever families had electricity/water. His house was one of the last to get it but he had one of his kids friends stay because he lived in a trailer park and they were having water issues.I think anyone that can shop for what state they want to live in should also be able to be self sufficient for water and electric.One curveball I'll throw out is that due to the pandemic people are fleeing the big cities leaving apartments and condos at extremely low prices. Just from an investment standpoint it may be wise to buy something downtown New York in the heart of tyranny. Maybe after Cuomo is thrown in jail he'll be replaced by someone slightly less bad and after a year with no more plandemic lockdowns the prices will go up as people realise that they miss being able to walk to the theater. I know what I said.  Jamie Dimon is probably spinning in his grave. I've lived in Arizona growing up (in the summers). It's ok...yes, the heat is an issue that you need to get used to. It certainly has its different areas, north in the mountains it can get cool. South near Tucson it's just wide open desert. Phoenix has its rich and poor areas as most cities do. I lived there as a kid so I wouldn't know much about the taxes, gun rights, property rights, etc. The way everyone deals with the heat is they go from their air conditioned house to their air conditioned car to their air conditioned business. You come back to your super hot car where I have literally fogged up the windows from my sweat evaporating from the heat. As some may know, I tend to want to be able to spend my bitcoins so I'm always looking at how to do so.I just found this awesome service that may change everything. https://paywithmoon.com/It just came out but it's a browser extension (I installed it on Brave) that allows you to pay with bitcoin on US websites that accept Visa payments.You go through the payment process on the website as usual...shopping cart, checkout, all that. Then you choose to pay with credit card, it gives you your total.Then you open up your Moon extension which asks you to input your total amount, then takes a Lightning payment (or Coinbase payment if you connect it) and then it gives you a one time prepaid visa card which you can then copy into the credit card payment and you're all set. No bank required.However, I did test it out on some obscure clothing store website that my wife has been wanting some clothes from for months but I told her since they don't accept bitcoin we can only shop on Amazon (through purse.io). The website rejected the payment with an error of "High Risk". Fortunately the extension has the option to refund the funds so no big deal. (Edit: This may be due to me signing in from Panama.)This opens things up quite a bit for the folks asking "but where can I spend my bitcoin?". I like that the Oklahoma house passed a bill saying that the state could decided the constitutionality of any federal law or executive order, as far as wether or not they will enforce it.OK could be a hidden gem. There's always NH, the free state. But most would be turned off by the cold.I won't recommend Panama. They displayed their tyranny during the plandemic by locking us all in our homes, only allowing men to go to the grocery store 2 times a week during a 2 hour window each day. They're finally opening up but at a huge cost to the economy. That's another thing to factor in. These places that destroyed their economies...now they need you to fund the government since nobody else has any money. No income tax is not as necessary when you retire from bitcoin. That's mainly capital gains.I would add...gun laws. Eventually you will be gunning down people invading your land.You may want to keep an eye on Nevada's free city laws. Check out https://www.blockchains.com/Tim Draper even mentioned that he is looking to buy 50k acres in Nevada for such a venture.Then again, there are the pro-Bitcoin cities like Miami.  So I finally signed up for the Fold card, touted for being bitcoin friendly...rewarding you with satoshis every time you spend using the card...went to the deposit page to load the card with money for spending and...no bitcoin option. Just a bunch of bank related options.Sucks. That was the first card I have signed up for in about 20 years only because it was bitcoin friendly. Only to find out it just has a rewards gimmick.
Looks like it lost a booster at the end there. I'm not talking about changing the orbit. It's about having control of the space in Earth's orbit. Mainly...if anything flies from Earth to space, they will need approval of whomever has all of their technology up there. Once someone is in a position to shoot down anything coming into space, they have full control over all future access to space. They also likely have the ability to destroy things on Earth from space such that they can now dictate what is done on Earth.Akin to people living on an island and a single company now owns all of the boats right off of the island. Anyone new creating a boat and putting it in the water will have it sunk immediately. These boats may also have artillery to shell the land. Whomever owns all of those boats now controls the island and any considerations of expanding off of the island. Yeah, I noticed that even with gold back when I followed it. It would initially crash with the stock market during a big event but long term in a bad market it would rise. Please find me a country willing to part with a bit of sovereignty.Apparently a nation sees a threat if even one square inch of their country is no longer under benevolent control of its mighty government. To take that away is to imply that the government is not the best in the world.It's like saying "can't we just have one guy on <insert your favorite sportsball team> wear a different uniform?". Government is a religion. To ask your religion to allow just a tiny bit of another religion in their realm is blasphemy. Powell's comments today may have played a role in the market.He acknowledged the obvious inflation, trying to downplay it as temporary but he also saw some recovery in the economy over the next few months.If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable, I expect that we will be patient" he said about raising interest rates.Like it or not, with all of the ETFs and corporations buying bitcoin we are now affected by the overall market a lot more than back in the day when price changes mainly reflected something happening in the Bitcoin world.Powell is basically saying that they're keeping an eye on inflation. They assume it will go up in the short term but also believe long term it will not get out of control so they will wait on raising interest rates until they see a long term trend in inflationary pressure.The key that we all should understand is that once the Fed raises interest rates, the everything bubble will pop. It will be the housing crisis and the 2008 market crisis times 100. Will Bitcoin crash with the market or will Bitcoin be seen as a hedge. Hopefully people will flee to bitcoin but who knows. When the market crashed due to lockdowns last March bitcoin crashed but bounced right back. So it's sort of hard to figure that one out. Ahh, true. I sometimes forget that people waste their days watching TV. I get it, it's like sleeping all day but not being asleep.I've been so much busier during lockdowns. Less people interrupting me with "socialising" allowing me to get stuff done. One eye opening thing I was told is...whoever controls Earth's orbit, controls access to space for all humans. And eventually the whole world.  I remember someone telling me that TECHSHARE let everyone know that I was in Vietnam. I was a bit confused at the time but was happy for people to think that as at the time I was on a boat to Singapore so misdirection was certainly welcomed.Unfortunately I did not get the chance to thank him but I certainly did appreciate it. He definitely had my back. This is stuff we're working on...it was the whole point of our seastead in Thailand.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loopIt would need to be done in the ocean.Strangely enough, about a week before the Thai navy came after us a friend of mine told me that he has had friends killed who were trying to create technology to go into space. I had this same thing happen. When I first started hanging out with my wife, Nadia, she loved going to the mall. We would walk and walk and all I could think was what a waste of time it was but it seemed to make her happy so whatever. I told her that they could give me the whole mall and tell me that I can take home anything I wanted. There isn't one thing I could think of that I would want in that mall.I am certain that there are a lot of people out there that would fear such a feeling spreading throughout the populace. They need us to desire crappy material items.I wonder if a year of people not going to restaurants or shopping all day has disrupted such a feeling and given people the break they needed to get over their addiction to such things. Just watched the RGB demo call. I am still confused as to how it works and I have delved deep into colored coins for several years. I guess that wasn't the point of the demo, explaining the underlying mechanisms (which I have perused but still don't quite get it).They showed the app on testnet creating an asset then transferring an asset. They said it will be able to work over the liquid network, Lightning Network as well as the regular bitcoin blockchain. All anonymously such that nobody can tell what has been transferred by looking at the transaction.One big sneak peak they gave was that future development will include staking and DEX with Bitcoin. Defi is coming to Bitcoin. They said it's about a year out. Their app is still in alpha stage, coming out on iPhone soon.  The truth is, and you can seriously go back and confirm this with the price, every time I have ever said anything bearish...if you had purchased bitcoin at that time and sold after the price rose 10% or so, you'd beat all TA ever provided on this forum.For every "thehorror.gif" I posted...we were usually bouncing along the bottom.I panic post instead of panic selling. I lost all of my bitcoins on the seastead. Saved up a few satoshis then those got scrapped with my cruise ship.I'm waiting for that Biden check to hopefully have some food when that comes around.No money for the wealth tax that's coming...unfortunately (because I love taxes). I would totally sell my account if it came to that. I checked how much my account was worth once and I figured if things get too bad I at least have that to fall back on. Better than going back to an 8 to 5 job. I'd sell my signature line but I don't post enough in the rest of the forum and would not want to waste my days posting just to make a few bucks a day. Just a quick FYI, RGB is testing asset transfers on Bitcoin with Client Validated Data.As I understand it, Client Validated Data allows for things such as smart contracts and NFTs in Bitcoin. I need to delve into it more but this supposedly can be done via the Lightning Network. By validating on the client side, it does not require the data to be kept on the blockchain.I'm going to try to get on the zoom call tomorrow where they go over some wallet implementations. But I think this could be something revolutionary.The reason I am interested in it is I believe we could have a stablecoin asset on the lightning network utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain such that all of the world's currencies can be upgraded to work on the Lightning Network under a single protocol. Which would eventually lead to people just leaving their nation's currencies behind as they realise that it's better to just keep your money in bitcoin. Which will now have smart contract capabilities allowing for decentralized exchanges of those currencies.Wether this cycle has played itself out or not, I believe the next cycle will be the last one...nobody will care about the price. It will be a race to not be the last one holding worthless legacy fiat. You get $50k!and you get $50k!and you get $50k!Edit: anditsgone.gif I certainly did not know TecShare or interact too much on the forum but he is an old school member here since May 2011 so he has been part of this community for a long time. The timing of his entry along with his posts about the Federal Reserve would lead me to believe he was also part of the Ron Paul community.From his posts he came on here seeing the opportunity for business and he dedicated much time toward that as well as to his reputation as a trader in many different things, contributing to the early bitcoin economy in his own way.He was certainly open about his politics and stuck to his guns, certainly in a passionate way. I know he was in a few threads I participated in the Politics and Society forum and we were usually on similar sides of the argument, though our approaches were certainly a bit different. It appeared that his politics were a bit more welcome in the earlier days than more recent years.From one og to another, RIP TecShare. No man, I found this great new token that's going to be the next Bitcoin but shinier. It will have longer addresses and there will be MORE coins. Only 90% pre-mine with trillions of coins remaining.This is going to be HUGE! Merdecoin...it's the future! You mean when someone stole 85 bitcoins from me?They didn't actually steal 85 BTC from me, I sold 30k euro worth of bitcoins to someone. It was at a McDonalds in Germany where I'd been selling bitcoins to get cash to live on. I got tired of a few hundred euros here and there, wasting my time. So I figured I'd be there for a few years and one guy wanted a lot of BTC so I told him I'd do 30k.I'd traded with the guy before, this time he sent his "associate" to drop off the money. I had this bad feeling going...like how in every movie where it's the "last score" something always goes horribly wrong. As I walked into the McDonalds there was some young guy eyeballing me. I went inside and it was packed. The middle of winter so everyone had their coats on. I sat down with the guy and we got to business. I counted the money, checked that it wasn't counterfeit, put it in my pocket. While I was doing this some guy kept walking past me back and forth which was odd because there were no seats for him where he was passing. At that point I just wanted to get out of there quickly. I released the bitcoins to the guy and got up making sure to keep my hand in the pocket where the money was.The guy stood up and asked me to hold his briefcase while he put on his jacket. I held it with both hands while he put it on. Then I put my hand back in my pocket and walked immediately across the street straight to the police station to make sure I didn't get jumped. Next to the police station was where my car was parked so I hurried to my car, took an alternative route home and finally made it to my apartment. When I took the money out to count it again I noticed that they all had big letters across them "VOID". Fake bills that you would buy on a tour of the currency printer. All of them.I went back to the McDonalds asking for the video footage to see if it was worth going to the police. The guy at McDonalds watched the footage and told me it was too grainy to see anyone's face but he saw when the guy picked my pocket when I stood up and the guy was putting on his jacket. He switched out envelopes.Come to find out it was an Eastern European mafia type gang. The guy standing outside probably would've jumped me had I made it out. I put the word out on the localbitcoins forums and about 2 months later I was contacted by someone who said the same thing happened to him in Amsterdam but he jumped the guy when he tried to do the same thing and everyone scrambled. He said he had the guy pinned, he was whining..."just let me go please...". He waited for the police to come and take him away.And thanks to me letting people on localbitcoins know about what had happened to me, I got thrown into a Europe wide sting operation that happened all on the same day where they went after people from the "dark web" looking for drugs and criminal activity. The German police showed up at my apartment thinking I was a criminal (part of the reason why I didn't report the theft in the first place...what do you know, they proved me right). They took all of my money, computers, and cell phone. They didn't find anything illegal of course, selling bitcoin personally was completely legal. I had a clearance at work, they tried to get me fired but my bosses knew everything, I was always open about how I got cash. From then on I stopped using cash altogether and went 100% bitcoin. They finally had to return my, now dated, electronics to me a year later. As well as my money. They had to admit that there was no evidence of me committing a crime. At least Germany returned all of my shit when they realised I didn't do anything wrong...unlike a certain other government.Let this be a lesson...don't keep your private keys solely on stuff in your home.  I'm mainly just preparing myself for it emotionally.I lose millions but hey...at least I was right on an Internet forum...
Here's a good synopsis of what Utopia was.https://lbry.tv/@Seasteading:8/seasteading-utopian-fantasy:9 Having lived in Thailand all I can say is:bum gun Yep, I was wrong last time too. Happily.Cautiously pessimistic. Ya, I threw $15k out there as just eyeballing the charts.   I think we've reached the top for this cycle though I'm happy to be proven wrong. We either do a bounce back to around $50k and begin our long road down to $15k or this is just a correction on the way to an even bigger all time high.There will be plenty of people talking about how "this time is different" just like the last 3 times. I remember the "China is getting in!" as the excuse many years ago and the cycle still played out the exact same way as it has every other time. "Corporations are getting in" is no different. China didn't save bitcoin from going down over time, the ICO craze didn't save bitcoin last time. Corporations won't save bitcoin this time.Inflation of the dollar may help the price not dip as much but it will still dip.My hodl strategy doesn't change. I already cashed out my spending money for the next 4 year cycle so I am fine either way. A higher ATH just means it will be that much higher in 4 years.One awesome thing we will see next cycle is RGB. They just began testing the ability to send colored coins over LN. There will be LN smart contracts and LN DeFi coming to Bitcoin. The tech is going to be awesome. This is the future.https://twitter.com/dr_orlovsky/status/1366011192733483008 The fact is that most people see seasteading as this dream world that they will move to and every one of their dreams will come true. It will be free and you will be rich flying your personal flying car from seastead to seastead spending every night watching the sun set with free cocktails and free food. A perpetual vacation where you also have every convenience of home without all of the difficulties.The reality is that you are trading government control on land for freedoms that you are likely not prepared to handle, all while living on a sea that is not a calm sheet of glass but a powerful force that makes life ten times more difficult than living on land.I'm not saying it's not possible because I have lived it. But it is certainly not for everyone. If you would have been one of the families crossing the cold tundra of Montana by wagon the first time with savages, wild animals and cold likely killing off half of your family while finding your new freedom then you could handle early seasteading.I have found that most people would rather dream of seasteading or wait for others to be the pioneers and work out all of the kinks before they're ready to go visit once in a while (only to return to their current lives).We gave people a glimpse of a future seastead with the cruise ship, Satoshi, with prices starting at $25,000 and the only responses were how it was not this utopia that they had dreamed about with the large 2500 sqft homes they are used to at home but on the sea, with a garden and flying cars. And, oh no, it's not in your back yard...it's far away in a different country.The idea of the super megastructure seastead is impossible. We bought the cruise ship at less than scrap prices meaning the price of the steel alone was more valuable than the ship. We weren't even trying to make much of a profit allowing us to offer cabins for $25k but this was still too much for people (the cabin is too small! I can't live there!). To actually build a super megastructure seastead would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Likely with the same sized living spaces costing at least half a million dollars (notice all of seastead designs of all of that open public space for walking around or lounging in the park...not based around high capacity living spaces).Unfortunately we need to take baby steps to help people understand that living on the ocean is possible (it's already possible...just look at people living in their sailboats). We are building floating homes in a sheltered marina so people can have a "taste" of seasteading without all of those difficult inconveniences like needing to protect your home from pirates or navies or making the day long trip to the grocery store or clinging onto the walls during a bad storm, wondering if you're going to survive the night.We already have enough orders for about a year of production but if you're interested in checking out what is being created here is what's being built in Panama:https://oceanbuilders.comThere are some other projects but few are outside of the design stage. We will be building more advanced homes for the open ocean but they will cost over $1 million for a select few people we would want as neighbours in an undisclosed location. Nice. Still haven't embraced the sea shanty craze but here's the song we listened to when we first spent the night at the seastead site to test our Internet:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzcv5TJkJBA Nice. How does one confirm that they never had control over something?Oddly enough, here in Panama they have a "guilty until proven innocent" legal structure for civil cases. This usually happens in domestic cases where the woman will claim that her husband abused her or her children during a divorce proceeding and the man now has to prove that he did not.A friend of mine said basically that if I am ever sued for something someone claims I did, I need to immediately do the same to them. It does not matter if it is true or  not. People who believe the US Capital building is some sort of sacred building that was disgraced by unwelcome freedom lovers entering it undeterred need to acknowledge that they see the state as a religion.Also, people who don't understand why this is such a big deal need to acknowledge that the US Capital building is considered a religious temple and it was disgraced by non believers. It will help you understand why they hated Trump so much. The person in their highest religious position, akin to the pope, not treating the office as they believe it should be treated...The state as a religion makes so much more sense. The fact that truth is ignored and replaced with whatever is necessary to continue the religion with whatever means is possible will give you a better understanding of what you are working with. A faith with a never ending changing nature determined by those in the most holy and sacred positions. Taxes are their tithing, they get so upset when you don't contribute your fair share to their religion. The fact that we are not using their holy money pisses them off to no end. This. Not to speak publicly about it but imagine having someone sue you just as you're trying to sell off a very expensive floating asset that costs a lot of money to maintain. Knowing that the longer they keep you from selling said asset, the more desperate you become. To the point where it's better just to hand over millions to make the suit go away.Some people work with the system so well that they weaponise it. There are no mechanisms built into government to prevent people from giving the government more power against their enemies. That is a powerful revelation and if you play that game you become very powerful. Are we able to connect to Namecoin domains via Brave somehow the way they have .onion capabilities built in? Fake meat has been a thing among seasteaders as the solution to growing meat out on the sea. Sure, fish farms and all that but that isn't all that encouraging to someone who wants a hamburger every once in a while.The thing I found interesting is you only need a few cells from the animal. So you could eat an otherwise endangered animal. And they're starting to be successful in bringing back to life species that have died off. Who knows, maybe the dodo bird is really tasty but we don't know. On Bitstamp we are less than 400 BTC away from $59900.We were just discussing 500 BTC to go from $47k to $49900 just a few weeks ago. We had the "journalist" in our home for a week, giving him a full account of what happened in Thailand. He was originally going to be writing for Men's Journal, then when that fell through he was trying to get it into Rolling Stone. He settled on some ocean environmentalist bullshit magazine. Magazine doing a fact check on me for an article coming out soon sent me this question (among 200 others):"You are a believer in freedom, at least of a particular form."Man this is going to be such a hit piece...from the questions I can summarise the article:Libertarian (someone who thinks all problems go away when there is no government) from Michigan (home of pro-fascist, Henry Ford) who's signature shirt is the Hawaiian shirt, associated with the racist Boog Boys, believes that he doesn't need to help fix society's problems. Instead he fled to the middle of the ocean, shirking his duties to the government. He, and seasteaders, talk positively about the American frontier even though there was slavery during those times.He and his seasteader friends just want seasteads so they can create a racist and homophobic society while they should be on land giving all of their bitcoins to each according to their needs.That Kaminska girl didn't even go as low as this guy is going. He may be positioning himself for a job working for the Thai media. Elon Musk literally crashed the market to create a Tesla logo in the charts.The rich are toying with us like we are their play things with our precious Internet money. We are all rich now.Does anyone know what caviar goes best with Wagu steak? I remember it was like a big box of Velveeta. We are all poor now.Does anyone have a map of the soup kitchens and homeless shelters?Do they still have Obama phones or is Biden handing out some sort of tin cans? Just watched the Silk Road movie (Don't worry FBI I paid for it in the location where it is available for paying to view it.)It was pretty well done.A bit sympathetic to the cop who stole money from him and used entrapment to incite a fake murder (which was never part of the actual charges, but brought up in order to paint Ross as a murderer).The real movie should include the judge going overboard in her zealous distain for freedom.It is almost impossible to live a life of freedom in an unfree world.
The decimal units are not part of the protocol. The decimal point can be used by consensus of miners letting those values go through. No hard fork required. I was given a few options on twitter for places where you can get loans of fiat for BTC collateral.Closest I've seen is Hodl Hodl saying they would lend stablecoins and "Blockfi gives usd loans using btc as collateral".Both things I will look into when going to buy property. They are, it does not mean they have to be.https://mises.org/library/medieval-iceland-and-absence-government Some key dates this year...July 25: COVID Eviction relief ends. If not extended, a lot of people will be given 30 day notices on that date and will be searching for a place to live by August 25July 31: Unemployment subsidy checks end. People who were getting an extra $600 or so per week will no longer receive it. August 8: Money given to small businesses to help with payroll stopsAugust 31: Mortgages that have been put off for the past year are now due either in a lump sum or higher monthly payments to pay what you owe. Moratorium on foreclosures ends.September 30: Student loan payment suspension endsDecember 31: You can no longer take penalty free withdrawals from your 401k.So September seems like it may be a big time for the US economy. I have heard bits and pieces about September being the start of a Jubilee (loan forgiveness, the Great Reset, etc.).One other key date coming up on Monday is the Federal Reserve meeting to discuss interest rates. If they go more hardcore that may drive bitcoin over $100k within days. If they start talking about the economy doing better then that could be the trigger for a big crash as people anticipate rates being raised and the money train coming to an end. Any TA charts out there for Bitcoin will need to be updated to take into account the 33% new money printed in the last year with much more to come this year.As I mentioned on my Facebook page...if you don't have 33% more wealth this year than last year (as well as earning 33% more income) you lost money. Ya, I knew that's what it was called...just wanted to see if anyone else knew it too. At $57,600 the price will have doubled in less than a month.Going from past experience this usually leads to doubling again in about half that time, and then another.My theory is that the doublings decrease each time. There's probably TA based around that but I just go by that. Sitting at the bank today today I was pretty much cheering on their incompetence. Oh...problem with your system? Of course. Need to get the manager? Typical. Oh look...a form for your read only database. Lovely.Thank you banks for making me rich. Never change. He never came out and spent any of the coins.It was found later that you could peel the sticker off with a bit of heat while keeping everything intact. That allowed you to see the private key and put the sticker back on.So they're good for a keepsake but not good for transferring to someone else with the idea that you're the only one with the key.And the government eventually cracked down him selling them so he could only sell the empty coins which you had to transfer your BTC onto them later.It was one of many early innovations that was tried because we were all excited about making Bitcoin work. Back in the early days of bitcointalk there was so much activity around making Bitcoin awesome. Now it's just shilling. If you do a search for any useful information the search result is filled with 2011, 2012 posts.There were certainly detractors but those were mainly based on the underlying economic principles of Bitcoin. Keynesians not liking deflationary currencies. They thought a currency should purposefully lose value over time. As a feature. I'm tired of the $50s...wen Mars? Ya, nervous about moving money to my bank account.Risk an exchange going down or risk the bank freezing my account for sending money from a bitcoin exchange...and then telling me to come to the closest branch to sort it out. I'll be the first to admit I was wrong. We did not hit the top and my order went through. Now the price can climb or fall as much as it wants and I'll be fine either way knowing that I never have to sell again. By the next 4 year cycle there will be no fiat to sell into.I won't be selling, I'll be buying things with bitcoins.I cut up my credit cards years ago. I have a shitload of money on the exchange and in bitcoins but I can hardly spend any of it as I have to trade BTC with friends for a few hundred dollars here and there. I dropped all of my banks in Panama because they're assholes. I'll let the world catch up to my lifestyle of not using banks or credit cards.Thank God for purse.io. I was very worried when they announced a shut down last year. I hope Bob is ok there in Texas.My brother has been sending pictures all day. I had to give him some Panama advice on how to keep your phones charged when you have no power for days.Charge with your laptops.Turn off phones when not in use.Last resort, charge them in your car with the car running. I certainly hope so. I did the sale years ago so as they say...don't let emotions play a role in your trades. It's certainly not a significant amount, but so many of the charts put us exactly where we are today years ago ($50-$60k range).Which is awesome because the charts looking into the next 4 years are pretty amazing.But we all know the other signs that we need to keep in mind...how many old friends that you haven't talked to in years are contacting you asking about some random shitcoin? How many people talking about $100k-$200k prices "soon".I do believe that in the next few years we will never need to sell again. We'll just be using our bitcoin. I set a sell order about 2 years ago for just under $50k because that's where I saw the charts going this round.I figured I'd put it under $50k due to the psychological barrier that it is.The price was within $150 of my sell.I was selling just enough for capital gains purposes to be ok as well as giving me enough cash to make it to through the next 4 year cycle when the price will be much higher.I hope there is one last push over $50k. But I would not be surprised if we reached the top for this cycle.However...I don't think the dip will be as bad this time around with the dollar coming close to being valued at less than the cost of the paper it's printed on.I used to watch the prices of wallpaper vs the size of a dollar. I figured that once the dollar was cheaper than the wallpaper I'd wallpaper one of my rooms with dollars. lol, I literally had to run to a bitcoin ATM friday to take my wife to dinner for Valentine's (pre weekend quarantine), because I'm "broke". The wall at $50k is about 500 BTC. There are a lot of sell orders going up to $50k as well.Real ones, not fake walls to move things one way or another.Edit: Just thinking back to the days of $2/BTC and how a 500 BTC wall would be a blip.I think I can honestly say I lived my life in such a way that I did all I could to stack sats from those days (aside from selling all of my BTC at $12).I treated bitcoin like it was worth $1k even when it was much less. There is a huge issue with fake honey from China. China figured out that they can produce synthetic honey a lot cheaper than using honey bees. So the US banned honey from China. So China continued to sell to places like Thailand and Vietnam. Who then sold to the US. The US then had to start genetically testing honey being imported.I do not know how blockchain could create a remedy for that. Perhaps the honey farm could have a video of each bottle getting a key added to the bottle which can be verified on the blockchain. Then it is verified by the store owner upon sale. Two bottles sold at different locations with the same key would raise questions. The reality that the n00bs do not understand is that they could just 100x their trades in bitcoin to have the same affect they get with altcoins because they're "too late".The alts will crash 100x when bitcoin crashes and alts can only hope to go up 100x with bitcoin.If you invested in an alt and you do not acknowledge that you are essentially in a ponzi scheme hoping you are in early and are able to get out before collapse then that's your gamble.I'm not sure how to 100x your bitcoin trade but if you have n00bs telling you they're too late, just tell them how to 100x trade a few satoshis for the same experience as you. 2017-18: blockchain not Bitcoin2020-21: crypto not Bitcoin2023-24: digital currency not Bitcoin
Deutsche Bank has been having financial problems ever since they shut down my bank account.Bitcoin can't save them. Stablecoins means we can convert directly into a stablecoin via a dex from our BTC and pay for stuff wherever they accept Mastercard. At some point seamlessly via LN.This is gentlement. It's someone who likely is freaked out about the news and fear porn he's been watching to believe that catching COVID is a serious thing.I suspect similar attempts by people running up and stealing someone's mask in a busy location will occur at some point as well. Or even just their 3rd mask. Not it's just day traders messing around.Next company to put BTC on their books will push it over $50k. Preparing for a future family. I have almost that exact same image on a different window.Going for the model X though. Same color. Helicopter going to SpaceX launch pad where the rocket to the moon is located. Everyone moving their dollars to BTC. Crossing $42k was necessary to continue this rally. Tesla buying will prompt a whole new push upwards due to the acceptance that it is what the smart companies are doing.Also, I was contemplating my next car. A plug in hybrid Pacifica or Rav4. I didn't consider Tesla because I want to be able to drive long distances.But after Musk started tweeting positive things about Bitcoin I looked into Tesla. Looks like charging stations are common enough that I can drive most places no problem.If I can buy a Tesla with bitcoin I'm buying one. I'm just waiting for BBQcoin to make a comeback. It's due. Price crashing.Is this the end of cryptography?  That sucks. I'm fortunate to have the funds. Yesterday I spent $500 on moving funds to a new stake only to see today that that contract was being canceled and to move to a new stake. Which I ended up doing for about $150. Observing large walls at $41k and $42k.Hopefully there's enough pressure to push through and avoid a double top. Chinese are buying all the corn! So I've been playing around with DeFi with a small bit of some of my old ETH and I went to "stake" some coins and the gas fee was over $2k. I canceled the transaction but I don't see ETH lasting much longer as it is. I've warned people away from ETH due to how overloaded it has all become and it appears that it is unusable at this point.  I have bought shitcoin during almost every bitcoin boom.First time (up to $266) I bought NMC, PPC and LTC. I spent more bitcoins to get them than I could get out today.Last time (up to $20k) I bought ETH. I spent more on the ETH than I could get today. Though I bought those for the Blue Frontiers token (which failed miserably, but they refunded our ETH due to not reaching their goal).Your shitcoin will jump 25-50% in a day. But it will also fall that much just as easily. And in the end, the only people using those coins are thinking they are going to make a lot of money that they can cash out into something else. Like bitcoin or dollars. Just acknowledge that you are pump and dump and try to get out at the top. I've looked pretty deeply into Liquid and it does make a lot of sense. I even contacted Blockstream to play a role on the Satoshi. They were excited about participating but told me they were more of an engineering company providing solutions than anything else.They are federated currently through a few exchanges but they keep growing the federation and they are working toward decentralized federalization. I do not doubt it happening eventually.I also checked in on RGB for Lightning and see that they are still updating their Github with code changes daily so it is active. They're closing off exits everywhere. It's been a while since I've used localbitcoins but I just noticed that they no longer have the option of cash in person. That's one of the best uses of Bitcoin in my opinion. Go to another country, have someone from localbitcoins meet you at your hotel when you arrive with a stack of local currency to use during your visit.Taking away uses for our money is not the right direction for the technology.
Probably. It's more of an experiment than anything to see if I can get almost spot prices on delivered coins using bitcoin via Purse.Asking for 33% discount is likely a stretch. I'm usually successful at 15-18%. Nobody is taking my order on Purse for 33% off of silver coins.It still puts the price just above spot. I know exactly what happened as that shit happens to me often. His tweet about Bitcoin had repercussions. Real life ones that would impact his business and the ability to move forward on his projects. They pretty much told him to shut up about Gamestonk and Bitcoin or else.This lead to him posting that he will be off of twitter for a while.Then he was like...fuck it...I'll just post some shit about Doge to show people that I'm not seriously endorsing anything, that he's just having fun on twitter.He is now openly fucking with those that threatened him.Right after he posted about Gamestonk and Bitcoin the FAA started screwing with him (he also mentioned that the FAA was getting in his way).He was likely served with some lawsuits by people that lost money on Gamestock for "advising them".He's the richest man in the world, people are going to go after him.I have had to become very quiet on social media since having a cruise ship. It sucks. I didn't think anyone watched my stupid little Youtube videos then I get something from one of my videos quoted in the Guardian and now I realise I need to post only stuff I would be willing to have in a news article or just post garbage that they cannot take seriously. Though I thought one of my Facebook posts about communism was tongue in cheek enough only to have a reporter ask me a question about it.Musk is just lashing out. Just sent $49k in Doge to your address. Hope it helps. Last week's GME/Robinhood debacle resulted in people seeing the financial system as a corrupt system that you can't beat.When people started asking "what can we do about it?", the collective response was DeFi/Bitcoin.At least in the echo chamber I follow on Twitter.Other reports showed that r/Bitcoin was flooded with over 100,000 new subscribers on Friday. The exchanges were getting overwhelmed by new sign ups on Friday and Monday.Today peoples' dollars are finally reaching the exchanges.Also, India's threat to make Bitcoin illegal which caused a small dip was found out to be just a proposal by someone in government. The poll likely shows that a large percentage has a lot of debt. After installing Brave I tried to open an IPFS file. I haven't been able to open any. It just hangs. Well, they really haven't changed their stance there. They're allowing people to buy and sell bitcoin through their banks. So they're just becoming more like an exchange. LBRYIt's just about the only place now where I can watch interesting content these days.But ya, the whole ICO thing was a bust. There were several projects that I wish worked out but they were simply a white paper. And you have to question the incentive structure of the premine or ICO. If you don't have something set up where the money is slowly doled out to developers over the course of X years then you have founders who make bank in the first weeks of the ICO where the price skyrockets, they take everyone to a big party in Vegas to celebrate, blow a shitload of money on Lambos then close up shop because they don't have to work their asses off...they're rich.I'm starting to realise that just about any new business loses its founder support after about 2 years. Someone had an idea, they got a few other people excited about it, they set out to make it happen with some euphoria of early successes and get more support...but there's only so much excitement you can have over an idea. I think the excitement wanes over time and it is that excitement that is necessary to keep people motivated.If I were an investor in real world stuff I'd buy small businesses at the 2-3 year mark. I used to own a bar and we happily sold it off at about the 2 year mark for pennies on the dollar. We'd done the "let's create an awesome bar with live bands" thing...it seemed cooler in the beginning than after 2 years of dealing with the every day difficulties of running a business.Jeff Bezos finally stepped down as CEO of Amazon after 20 years. If you can work your ass off on a dream for 10-20 years then you deserve the success he has. Just a quick search on how LN colored coins are doing these days and I found this impressive project:https://github.com/LNP-BP/FAQ/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/RGB%20%26%20Spectrum%20explanation%20for%20business.pdf I really do not see how it is possible to make money on staking and DeFi with gas being $50-100 for a transaction. The only way anyone will use a DEX is if they're trading millions.I think atomic swaps, bisq and Lightning make more sense for a DEX. Lightning colored coins looked like a great solution for the ability to issue "tokens". Admittedly, my hope for Bitcoin as an every day currency is hampered by the high transaction fees. But LN creates the possibility. I also understand how difficult LN is as well.Most people don't like them but I like Blockstream's Liquid solution for all of this. For the simple fact that they are practicing advanced Bitcoin features on their sidechain which includes Bitcoin native smart transactions.For much of what we all talk about, the poor stock market, the poor system of governance in place right now, we need to have effective alternatives in place before we do any work to bring it all down. Otherwise an even worse solution will get implemented. I sent a guy a lot of bitcoin for the rights to the "Over 9000" meme. I think it's probably about time I check with him to see how much money I made. I think it was probably a whole lot. That was going on for quite a while.I may re-invest into the "that escalated quickly" meme. Lambo is so 2017...building a race track...that's where it's at.Perhaps you can invite all of the Bitcoin Lambo people to your place for a ride. I have bought 2 stocks and received the cert (late 90s).There was a website called 1stock (or something) where you could buy a single stock and they would send you the certificate. It was a complete gimmick as I paid $100 for a $45 McDonalds stock. I bought one for my nephew for his birthday, it included something for kids to learn about stocks. By owning that share he received a yearly stock report in the mail as well as usually some sort of coupon or something for something free at McDonalds.I think the process changed and you could no longer get the cert anymore so the site is gone and last I checked the state had some money in his name for him to retrieve. I assume it has something to do with that one share.What's the point of the stock market at this point? I used to make some good interest on Bitfinex in the early days with my BTC. Wondered what the downside was. Until they got hacked.Fortunately they reimbursed everyone after the hack but it taught me that there is certainly risk.There are ways to decentralize your BTC via wBTC and get interest but that requires going down the DeFi rabbit hole and that is also certainly not without risk. I watched it and was amazed at how many parallels there were to our adventure.I will likely do a side by side comparison some day reviewing the film. Usually what happens when a lot of people who are not very smart about something hear a bad thing is happening with the system and they become slightly knowledgable about it the result is usually more government.Example: Viruses. No matter what happens on the stock market or the bitcoin price I'm pretty much set.I just installed the Brave browser yesterday and I've already made 8 cents just by browsing so...ya, you can say I'm kind of a big deal Is this the end of Bitcoin?Time to shut down the nodes and buy a bunch of FRNs?  Are you just going to repeat this post over and over?
Ya, Gamestop is certainly a pawn in this whole thing.I think it was more like a bunch of online traders that have been following the hedge funds shorting over and over again talking about it and saying they should do something but nobody ever does anything.Then they go after Gamestop and there are enough gamers online to finally say, today we do something about it.It could have just as easily been something like Alienware or other somesuch company that would rally the nerds around it.I would buy a Gamestop solely so I would have dibs on the latest console games to come out. Though I'm not much of a gamer anymore. Too busy. Can you imagine working in Gamestop HQ. Your stores have been closed for a year due to a plandemic and your stock is way down...facing bankruptcy, you see the writing on the wall when a major hedge fund known for killing companies shorts the shit out of your stock and starts having their media puppets talk about how worthless your stock is...You sit there at the office, go on Monster.com to find another job, you start packing up your personal items so you don't have to worry about them later, you check in on your co-workers that will probably have a hard time finding another job...Then you come into work the next day and find out that some random reddit posts are turning your company into the next Google. I almost want to open a Gamestop now.They could take this influx of money and turn it into something amazing for the gaming industry.Or instead of going to the mall you go to the Gamestop. I have 100 million BTC tokens for sale, each token backed completely by a number of BTC.I will sell at a discount of only $34k each..000000001 is a number I used to be a defense contractor. One of my friends still in that world told me"Rumor has it the military is telling contractors they can't buy in to crypto"When I was in, there were similar guidances with regards to things they felt a threat to their order.They enforce it by holding your clearance over your head.The whole point being that if Bitcoin replaces the dollar they lose their printing press funding their decades long wars.Bitcoin is the destroyer of long term wars. They're finally figuring out what we've known all along. And they're scared. Robinhood opened trading back up for Gamestop after getting an extra $1 billion from investors.Gamestop price up over $300. The reason Doge is up so much is that Roger Ver keeps repeating over and over that Bitcoin transaction costs are too high. So people are moving to Doge to solve that problem.I think that's what he was getting at. Broker chair talking about how they're protecting their asses:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html"A loss of 10-15 billion dollars...I'm afraid that there are brokers that will not be able to meet these margin calls" Telling my family to get all of their money off of Robinhood ASAP.It looks like they won't survive until the weekend. One thing that needs to be dealt with in this matter is the fact that people can buy bitcoin on Robinhood but they're not actually buying BTC. Similar to the PayPal scheme, you can't pull your bitcoin off. You have to sell it.I know my sister bought bitcoin on Robinhood because it was easy.We need to give these folks an easy way to move from Robinhood BTC to an exchange BTC (and eventually into their own wallet).I think the only way would be for them to sell BTC on Robinhood, take the money out in dollars into their bank account and open up an exchange account and move the dollars there.People don't like taking that many steps.  I installed Robinhood to see if I could walk one of my family members through the process of buying BTC on there. Never could get it to work (they didn't accept my bank login).So today I contacted them and told them to delete my account. Told them it was because they wouldn't let people trade in stocks they want to when the big boys get hurt. Yep, that's them.I didn't want to hand over my information to them not knowing what they were doing because I figured that if I hand them my proof of claim then if they were just scammers they could take my proof to the real lawsuit. It was more of a desperate plea for some pictures of butts.And it worked. I have been contacted by a few people claiming to be lawyers in the case of Bitcoinica. They tell me to give them information and proof of claim but these are just random people on the Internet asking for information.Has anyone else had any contact? I lost some BTC on that exchange way back in the day. I'm not all that good with the TNA but isn't a double bottom good? I always wondered about the whole 9 to 5 thing. I always figured it was just a song from the 70s before people started working 8 hour days. Every place I worked had an hour for lunch which meant 8 to 5. Though, my first job they allowed 10 to 7 because we had a cool boss and we were a bunch of computer nerds.My favorite job ever was working in Afghanistan on night shift from 6PM to 6AM. My ideal life would be to live my life at night while the rest of the world sleeps. Gets me in the feels. I think Gamestop price went up because people figured out the Gamestop trick for getting gas with bitcoin.You buy Gamestop gift cards, then you go into Gamestop and buy a gift card for the gas company. Boom, you just paid for your gas with bitcoin.At least that was how it worked about 8 years ago. Maybe people finally started reading old blogs. For tax purposes I was thinking of forming a charity. My thought being a long term charity (so I can set up a charitable remainder trust).The charity idea I have is the promotion and facilitation of helping businesses to accept bitcoin at their point of sale. I think if every business in the US were accepting bitcoin (lightning payments) then eventually the only need for dollars would be to pay taxes (which could also easily be paid in bitcoin using a third party service, perhaps a non-profit I set up as part of the charity). The only reason for the US dollar would eventually only be a way of the government keeping track of their balance sheet which would eventually need to be expressed in terms of bitcoins instead of USD. Until finally there's enough political pressure for the government to just switch over to what the rest of the country is using for payments.The charitable remainder trust would be investing the funds into bitcoin. This allows bitcoin users to donate at peaks to get their tax break while still being invested in bitcoin. Their payouts being in dollars over the course of years or decades to themselves or their children.Currently there are not charitable remainder trusts that invest in crypto. 
I've been watching the TV series Yellowstone. 3 seasons in and no SJW shit.It's a joy to watch. Lesson from owning a cruise ship...there are a lot of people/systems in place built to extort you once you have something of value that you want to keep.It's ridiculous. Throwing millions here and there just to fend off people from using the force of government to take away our property.I've been watching the TV show Yellowstone, which has a similar storyline, only with a guy and his ranch.I was a minimalist just 3 years ago where I only owned about 40 items (including every piece of clothing). It was bliss. No worries.Of everything I think bitcoin is the easiest thing in the world to actually own that has value.Though it appears that CSW is trying to join the ranks of those utilizing the force of government to go after that as well. Fuck that faketoshi guy. I watched the British Utopia series which was interesting.I just started watching the American Netflix version of it and it's just in your face PC insanity. One guy's family is made up of children of every minority they could fit in there. The show inspires me to become an American TV writer where it's mainly about disabled minority transgender people just doing every day normal stuff. No plot really necessary, maybe I'll throw in...hero has a bad day, hero overcomes it (or a tragedy...hero has a good day, it turns into a bad day). The hero being a mentally disabled minority quadriplegic that is struggling with his gender identity. Do I hear Emmy? Look for a bank or government working on blockchain, not Bitcoin. They love that shit.Also, you won't have to build a blockchain. Learn Oracle. I got the same thing.The creditor number is in an older e-mail.I think they denied my claim because I only had like .4 BTC on the exchange when it went down.Though I had more on Bitcoinica when it went down...maybe 40. But I used an old work e-mail.I have been getting e-mails from people saying they're seeking claims for Bitcoinica and ask me to send proof of my money on the platform...but how do I know it's not just someone trying to use my proof for their own submission?Getting 40BTC would be nice though they would likely pay me the dollar equivalent which would likely be less than $100. It's hard to watch anything anymore. I was watching one TV series and one of the very last episodes they cut to a scene where one of the girls comes out as gay and her feelings about that, then it never comes up ever again in the whole series. They could have gone through the whole show without that scene and it would have had zero impact on the plot. Is there some quota or something in Hollywood or something now? I mean, I do get it...homosexuals tend to have more money because they usually don't have kids. They are a great customer. So for capitalist reasons it makes sense. I almost opened a gay bar for this very reason. The bar I owned wasn't even close to making the amount of money the gay bar down the street. It's all about the BTCBTCBTC kamala24.com is availablejust sayin... The former soviet oligarchs took their money and found new allies in the Democrat party and are using them to get them put back into their positions of power.They just need a war and a rebuilding. Simple. Good essay.I believe there will be a WWIII. They tried to do it last year but Trump interrupted it with an end around peace deal. That didn't work out very well for him.Now that he's out that will be back on the table.And apparently the Democrats have some beef with Russia so we have yet another Russia/USA war. At least the movies will be better with Russia as an enemy. Sterilization for the planet.Ok, I just need to figure out how to exploit that for power under the new regime.The best time to be an individualist is if you are in power under a socialist tyranny. People like Stalin and Hitler were the most powerful individuals in the world. Just planning out my future in this new communist takeover of the world (Great Reset) and I was wondering what bullshit fallacy I should support to hide among believers. Will they go back to climate change or do they not even need to play that game since they won?Are we stuck using the medical establishment as a means of abusing people? Should I act like I'm helping fight the virus or will they just drop that whole thing once they have all of their enemies in camps?Do I just move forward to focus on the next phase of working to squash any individuality? Just focus on exalting communism itself since they will no longer need to hide behind these games and just come out already and just be bold about what they're actually doing?What is next after the medical lies or will they take that to some new extreme once they have full control over your body? Maybe I jump forward to support gender transformation or just skip right ahead to castrating every male outright?Any communists want to chime in on what their ideal future is now that your enemies are being silenced and you pretty much have free reign over destroying the world? They are going after Ron Paul on Facebook.The only reason I got on Facebook and twitter was because in 2007 supporters wanted to get Ron Paul's social media numbers up so we were all on board with joining these platforms and following Ron Paul.If they see it against their community standards to have Ron Paul's words of liberty on their platforms then they do not meet my standards in a platform on which to spend my time.I am dropping Facebook and twitter. I'll play around with platforms like Flote and others until there is a truly decentralized version like LBRY that comes along.I am fully planning my next 4 years based on the reality that communism is coming to America. Planning my means of being powerful in a communist system using history as a guide. The most selfish individualistic people in the world are those at the top of such power structures and I plan on taking my slice of individual liberty that only a tyrannical regime can provide. My sister went to visit a restaurant in a country that had rising inflation. They would only accept cash because they said if you use your credit card they don't get the funds for another few days and by then the money is worth less. Count yourself lucky. I don't live in the US either but unfortunately I have that nasty citizenship. Time to learn that DeFi stuff.https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-tax-increase-agenda-revived-as-democrats-win-senate-11610025764WASHINGTON Democratic control of the Senate gives President-elect Joe Biden a much stronger chance ofraising taxes on corporations and high-income households.Until this week Georgia runoff elections, Mr. Biden plans for taxincreases were running into solid oppositionfrom the Republican-controlled Senate. But now, Democrats will hold the WhiteHouse, Senate and House simultaneously for the first time in more than adecade, and they are poised to use that power.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden proposedraising taxes on corporations, estates and high-income households, reversing keyparts of the 2017 tax cuts passed by Republicans and reprising policiesthat the Obama administration couldn=E2=80=99t get through Congress. Democrats hadspent the time between November=E2=80=99s election and this week runoffs lookingat bipartisan compromises and examining what the administration could dounilaterally.Now, some of Mr. Biden's ideas are much more likely to become law, said Steve Wamhoff of the progressive Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,who said that the president-elect's plans are less far-reaching than someDemocratic alternatives and are broadly popular with the public.The issue was always, could Democrats get something on the floor? And theanswer to that is now clearly yes, Mr. Wamhoff said. Biden did winafter campaigning on raising taxes on corporations and raising taxes on therich.Even so, Democrats face a series of tough challenges to turn thoseproposals into law with narrow legislative margins, a weak economy and astill-raging pandemic. The results might look quite different from thecampaign-trail outlines, and the slim majorities may yield less than the $3trillion in tax increases that Mr. Biden sought.The Senate will be divided 50-50, and Democrats will have Kamala Harris breaking ties as vicepresident. That means they can't lose a single vote, pushing them to lookfor policies that unite progressives eager to address income inequality andmoderates worried about the effects of tax increases on the economicrecovery. The same dynamic holds in the House, where Democrats have a slimmargin.One vote is a pretty narrow majority, said Mark Mazur, a former Obama administration official who is now director of the Tax Policy Center, aWashington research group. It's going to be a matter of persuading people.But at least you have a chance.Mr. Biden has said repeatedly and reiterated Wednesday that he wants towork with Republicans. But unlike other policy areas, tax changes can passwith a simple majority of senators, instead of the 60-vote majority oftenneeded for most other legislation. Democrats will face pressure from theirbase to deliver.The likely result: Up to $2 trillion worth of tax increasesover the next decade, says Donald Schneider, an economist and former HouseRepublican aide at advisory firm Cornerstone Macro. That is shy of what Mr.Biden proposed but still a significant bump in federal revenue to pay fornew programs and targeted tax cuts and far beyond what could happen ifRepublicans had held the Senate.It makes an enormous difference, said Republican economist DouglasHoltz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.Democrats may attempt to mesh these longer-term plans with their efforts toprovide tax cuts and other economic relief during the coronavirus pandemic.Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is poised to be majority leader, saidWednesday that one of the party=E2=80=99s first moves would be to authorize the$2,000 stimulus payments that were blocked in the waning days of last year.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden proposed more than $3 trillionof tax increases over a decade to raise revenue to pay for some of hisspending plans, according to the Tax Policy Center. That includesinitiatives on the environment and health care.For corporations, he would raise the tax rate to 28% from 21%, impose aminimum tax on companies with lower effective tax rates and increase taxeson U.S. companies foreign earnings.Households making more than $400,000 would see their tax rates go up underthe Biden plan, and he would raise the top rate to 39.6% from 37%. He wouldalso limit deductions and raise payroll taxes for that group, though hisproposed payroll-tax changes may not qualify for the fast-track rules toavoid a Senate filibuster.He would also change how assets are taxed at death. Currently, people whodie with unrealized gains don't have to pay capital-gains taxes, and theirheirs only have to pay on gains after the original owner's death. Mr. Bidenwould apply capital-gains taxes to those increased asset values at death.The highest-income households would pay capital-gains rates roughly equalto those for ordinary income.Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), the likely Finance Committee chairman, has adifferent approach to the same issue, calling for annual taxes onunrealized gains. Democrats may end up going with a more modestcapital-gains tax rate increase instead, Mr. Schneider said.Mr. Biden also proposed some targeted tax cuts. Notably, he called forexpanding the child tax credit to $3,000 from $2,000, adding $600 for youngchildren and making those payments monthly instead of once a year in taxrefunds. He also proposed tax credits for caregivers, renters andfirst-time home buyers.House and Senate Democrats also back those child tax credit expansions.And Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), chairman of the House Ways and MeansCommittee, has been preparing to advance infrastructure legislation andchanges to encourage retirement savings, both areas that could bebipartisan but could also move as part of Democrats efforts.Democrats may also try to cut some taxes for high-income constituents byrepealing the $10,000 limit on state and local tax deductions. That isimportant to Mr. Schumer and lawmakers from high-tax states such as NewYork and New Jersey. But other Democrats, including progressives and thosefrom states without income taxes, may object.Democrats will have to choose which tax policies to pursue first. They willgrapple with the complicated design questions to put details to thecampaign rhetoric. They will have to figure out when any new taxes shouldtake effect retroactively for this year or prospectively as the economyrecovers.They will do all of this amid a global pandemic in a situation where anymember's absence or illness can change the balance of power.In both houses of Congress, it's going to be so tight as to defydescription, and everything has the chance to fall apart, Mr. Holtz-Eakinsaid.Democrats likely won't wait until the economy is on surer footing to passtheir tax increases, though they may delay the start dates of thosepolicies until 2022, Mr. Schneider said.You have an opportunity to legislate, he said. You're going to do it. All of my bitcoins were on the seastead that the Thai navy confiscated.  I'd put a hidden camera inside an ICU to verify the government's numbers but they have us locked down like prisoners. Can't pass between zones without the proper documentation, etc.I've been inside different hospitals twice this year, both times when it was supposed to be overwhelmed and I saw nothing. A very slow day. One time sitting for 6 hours outside the emergency room seeing the ambulance come in maybe 3 times. Another sitting in the emergency waiting room about 12 hours hardly seeing anyone come in.A bit of transparency to prove the numbers on a website when the result of those numbers is to institute tyranny would go a long long way.At the very least, all of the people affected by the government tyranny that are now homeless should just move into the empty hospitals.https://153news.net/watch_video.php?v=A7OXY2UMW4YA&fbclid=IwAR1i-Bs3PZsPY1jsIUiVckRZI69EC_eBG_a5WHSRUuaMCv64V2O7DJxQOrMI don't think it takes 2 years to become a medical professional good enough to make TikTok videos. You only need to spend several hours of rehearsal and choreography to get that stuff down so I don't think it's a staffing problem. I'd say look up "empty hospitals" on Youtube but they have all been taken down.But Bitchute...https://www.bitchute.com/video/EBpezGTu08Fy/If they're telling the truth, full transparency should be encouraged. A simple video of the full ICU would show people how serious this is (not using fake dummies in beds). I had an anti-bitcoiner ask how can someone make money without being a leech on society without doing any work. Implying that anyone gaining wealth with bitcoin was leeching off of society without work.I listed all of the other investments that also generate revenue such as income producing real estatestock investmentscommodity investmentsinterest bearing bank accountloaning money to peopleetc.I finally had to unfollow him, every post he has is a cry for help from a nocoiner. I tried to live in a place with no taxes and they tried to kill me for it.No roads, no justice system, no healthcare.It was wonderful.
The dollar is down 83% since the pandemic started. I finally got my family to invest at around $7k. Even my 80 year old mom bought at $9k.Today I told them that the next step for them is to put in a limit order at a higher price that they think it may reach and only sell half. I told them it could jump to $100k but that it would only happen for a minute and they'd likely be out driving or doing something else to catch the top in time.My sister figured out a limit order.I talked my brother through converting his sons' private keys into a wallet after I sent them one BTC as a gift back in 2015 and told him it could pay for their college one day. He said he didn't believe me until today.I usually send the n00bs to Coinbase. No harm in them losing their $200 investment to a Coinbase hack. The key is them learning how Bitcoin works. I'll probably sell up to enough to not go above a certain capital gains tax bracket to get me through another 4 years of spending money.The fact that they printed 37% of all dollars in the past year, if you're not up 37% over the past year you lost money. I can think of nothing other than Bitcoin to have as an investment as we go into the "Great Reset" where "you will own nothing and love it". Your wait is over.Bitcoin passes Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway by market caphttps://cointelegraph.com/news/rat-poison-squared-bitcoin-passes-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-by-market-cap I would consider moving to Miami because of this.Miami's certainly not on my top list of places to live in the US but if it is a Bitcoin friendly city I would live there.I think Wyoming would be higher on my list though. And they are doing some great things there for Bitcoin. This is actually a good strategy.A charitable trust.If you are able to cash out your gains into a charitable trust you essentially donate the full amount to a charity (executed upon your death).The trust you put your money into can pay you dividends, pay you from the principle over time, etc.You know the term "trust fund babies"...you can set up the trust to pay out a certain amount to your children over time, etc.You get the initial first year benefit of the amount you donated to the charity as a discount on your taxes and you can spread your gains over several years instead of a single lump sum.I considered this as an option because living overseas I can make up to $100k per year tax free. But I am subject to all taxes on capital gains.The thing holding me back from doing a charitable trust was that you have to hand your money over to a company unrelated to you to manage the trust. After weighing my options the last time it reached $20k I just could not see putting a lot of money into some fiat based investment that would give me 5-6% yearly gains in a currency losing value at 8-10% per year, run by some idiot fund manager. So I just kept it all in bitcoin and decided to live off of money cashed out at the lowest tax bracket (which is still a lot in 2nd world countries). Very cruel but I predict that McAfee will be made to eat his own dick while in prison at the end of the year.I do not wish that on anyone. The key this past week was that we did not form a right shoulder. I would have...the speaking Spanish part was an obstacle.And in Panama it is pretty much...you're hiring the decision maker's cousin. This is exactly what I started telling our people to tell the insurance companies (give us a deductible up to the amount of coverage). At one point we were ready to self insure but our ship management company insisted P&I was the only way.I did not have the time to become an insurance expert enough to argue with the company we hired that is one of the top ship management companies in the world that is supposed to know the maritime insurance industry.I will have time now to become an expert in the same way I became an expert in maritime law and was arguing with our maritime lawyers, explaining the law to them. An auction usually "starts from". Out of 100 rooms for sale during the auction only 10 were sold. So in every category of cabin you could have purchased at the lowest price. We wanted the auction to catch any problems where someone wants two rooms right next to each other or in front of each other but someone else wants that room. Let the highest bidder have it.Correct about paying for food and electricity. You have to pay for your own food. I know it's kinda crazy to consider no free food but we were trying something quite radical.I'm not sure what you mean by "hard rules about living onboard". You think there would be more rules on a ship run by anarchists than the island that was .5 miles from the ship or on land that was 6 miles from the ship?Did people truly think we were putting the ship 200 miles out in middle of international waters with no way to escape?We were closer to downtown Panama City than commuters that drive to the city every day from out of town. People living in the outer suburbs could have literally rented a cabin on the ship and commuted to work and been to the city faster than their former neighbors. People literally live on the island that would be swimming distance from the ship.If this is what people believed it may have been our marketing that did us in.Then again, we realized that the Internet is for talking. Not for doing. We believed people wanted a sort of Bitcoin city as a testing ground for living on bitcoin. We believed people wanted to test out seasteading even if it was just the first step at a much cheaper price than any seastead in the future will ever ever be again (we paid less than scrap prices for what was essentially a ready made seastead, just the cost of the raw material). All future seasteads will need to pay for not only the raw material but the labor, shipyard costs, government interference, and likely a company that actually wants to make a profit instead of a couple of guys that want to make something happen so much that they're willing to break even as long as we can make something great happen. In the end the lack of insurance was the straw that broke our back. It was like dominos where that one piece of the puzzle brought it all crashing down.Owning a cruise ship, every day is money so the clock is ticking from day one of buying the ship to becoming revenue neutral. During that time you are shelling out money to keep the thing going. The sooner revenue neutrality comes, the better. This wasn't a boat (bring out another thousand), it was a boam.We were trying to play nice. We were in talks with Panama's presidential office, the marine authority, ministry of tourism, etc. They all told us they wanted our ship in Panama. But they all did what they could to make sure they could get what they could out of the project with no regard for how that affected the success.The marine authority classified the ship as a seagoing vessel though we were pleading with them to not classify it as such as it would have bad consequences.The demand for cabins was nil. Even with the lowest prices we could possibly offer and break even, nobody wanted to live on it.Our ship management company was not very useful when trying to get us insurance, more of a spectator of "let's see how this 'crazy' project is treated by the strict, good ol' boy club of insurances". The insurance companies were almost toying with us, asking for information on how we would deal with X or Y...we give them some reasonable response that we think they will be ok with only to the response of "denied" (no explanation). Nobody ever let us speak directly to the insurance companies to discuss what they would accept for various scenarios ("highly unprecedented", when we asked).We could have come up with another solution, we could have done some blockchain type of P&I insurance...over time. We focused on complying with maritime and Panama law as opposed to gaining an expertise in maritime insurance (assuming that surely a private insurance company would want money). So being turned down by all of the companies caught us off guard. With time of the essence, no support from the seasteading nor Bitcoin community that we were trying to serve, the Panama government reneging on their promise to work with us and the final stroke coming from lack of insurance we had to pull the plug before paying to cross the canal. We had a day to make the decision so we went with it.We bought the ship at below scrap prices, we burned through a few million and are selling it for higher scrap prices so dollar wise we even out. But lost potential, Bitcoin wise, we can put it down as "losing" half of our investment.I was not the big investor in the project (as usual). With the bitcoin price being up and the main investor being a member of the Vladmir club...expect something brilliantly insane to come next (I am the guy in the spotlight because our main investor speaks his mind too readily...he makes me look like a US congressman in comparison).I will likely sit out this next adventure and go into hibernation like I did after Thailand until I am pulled back out into the world by the next project.I chose seasteading as my passion project because I have been following it for 10 years and wanted to see something actually done instead of people just talking about it all the time and I see it as one of the shortest avenues toward a modicum of freedom. I have time to decide my next steps. Now I focus on myself (and my wife) and take a good break from things for a while. So we have a lot of people that have been interested in coming and checking out the Crypto Cruise Ship, MS Satoshi.The time is near. The ship arrives in Panama on December 22nd and we anchor on the Pacific side after passing through the canal on the 23rd.We're having a New Year's Party on board then opening officially for guests on January 3rd to commemorate the first Bitcoin block.Rates include nightly (starting at $88/night), weekly (starting at $546/week) and long term rentals (starting at $1311/month).Reserve your room now at https://vivavivas.comDon't bother getting out your credit card to pay, fiat is not accepted. I am moving beyond just saying "yes, just by bitcoin and hold it".Instead I will ask them to ask themselves why they never bought bitcoin before. In what ways are they living their life differently from the many people that bought bitcoin early. Why is it that they are just now considering buying. If they just want to get rich in dollars then they have missed the whole point of bitcoin and they should not buy.If they want to buy bitcoin they should stop watching the media and propaganda that has hidden bitcoin from them this whole time. They should actually start looking into what money is and what gives it value.  They should actually read the White Paper to find out what this whole 'Bitcoin' thing is all about.If they want to go down that road, then my door is wide open and the advice is free. If they just wanna get rich on the next boom, then gtfo. Maybe Biden self identifies as the winner of the election.  The ship will be close to shore near Panama City. We will not be a seagoing vessel which eliminates about 25 international maritime treaties that we would be subject to otherwise.We hope to create a special economic zone in the water but I cannot promise that at such an early stage. Though we have the full support of the Panama government.With cabins starting at $25,000...what are you waiting for?https://oceanbuilders.com/auction-page Strangely enough reddit r/Bitcoin removes any picture of Satoshi that I post.Tried to post: If your economy is underwater, throw out a lifeline. Ask and ye shall receive! It's happening!May I present...the MS Satoshi.As for monthly fees, we have those listed here: https://vivavivas.com/faq Cabins starting at $25,000You can check out the rooms here: https://oceanbuilders.com/auction-page Orange will be in a different location. Sides will be in blue.Waiting on most of the paint until we're in Panama...Permission to paint the boat is upwards around $20k at the port in Pireaus.So only the legally required minimum for now.
It's happening!May I present...the MS Satoshi. Expect military trucks to drive into the justice department shortly before Trump leaves office.Expect Trump to walk away a very rich man. Want Bitcoin price is up 50% from the time we began the purchase of the Crypto Cruise Ship.As of 4:20PM GMT today, the MS Satoshi is now owned by Ocean Builders.The auction for the cabins is now open:https://oceanbuilders.com/auction-page/You can have a cabin on the Satoshi for less than 2 BTC.The official stamps for the ship have been made: Why sell when your coins are welcome here: Knowing this is how I sleep soundly at night while hodling bitcoins. I'm liking the PayPal thing...My initial thoughts are that we could integrate this as a solution for bitcoin payments on the cruise ship. There are already PayPal NFC point of sale terminals. Everyone just sign up for a Paypal account, load it with BTC and pay everywhere on the ship.That would allow people that just want to use fiat to do so as well.There are also ways of loading up an NFC ring with payment details. Much to research but this could be pretty great. People: Yay, that will teach Google to not be such bad meanies.Also people: Why did the government drop the anti trust lawsuit on Google so quickly? Also people: Why does my computer suddenly slow down a lot when I go onto any web page with Google ads?Also people: I never noticed that light next to my camera before. The way I see it. We could have had an alternative to Bitcoin years ago. There was eCash and others but the governments of the world with their monopoly thirst for power over currencies prosecuted anyone providing an alternative.So...you had the option...decades ago, for a simple, low power solution. But you were too greedy. So now we need to burn energy to make up for government greed. Nice. But we need NFC payment so we can distribute something like these to people on board: Yep, fell asleep watching that last night.May be cheaper to hire some young kid to put a bunch of those together for us. Does anyone know of any NFC Point of Sale devices that work with Lightning Network?I'd like to look into buying these for the cruise ship. Great points and part of the whole point of the ship was so that we have a place to house all of the employees for the manufacturing of future floating platforms. This is just the springboard for something bigger.I know the big question on everyone's mind is "what is the monthly fee". I have a good estimate which should be reasonable but I'm not throwing out numbers that may make people upset if I have to change them once we get more solid numbers. I am in talks with the ship management company on estimates on their end. Remember, we are going to be renting the commercial space. If I could pay all of the maintenance fees through those payments I would but it appears that there is some overflow that needs to be covered by room fees (there is a trade off between having businesses that are so expensive that you can't afford to eat vs raising the monthly fee).We chose Panama, especially the Gulf of Panama, due to its geographic location outside of the hurricane and tropical storm zone.Though we are currently headquartered on the Caribbean side of Panama, we had to move to the Pacific side due to the path of storms.As for emergencies, we will ensure that we are at all times able to lift anchor or release the mooring and move the ship. Hey guys, if you have not heard about it I bought a cruise ship with a few other investors and we are all big Bitcoin supporters so we're calling it the MS Satoshi and turning it into a Crypto Cruise Ship to be anchored close to Panama City (within Panama waters, under a Panama flag...so completely under Panama law FYI).We will be accepting Bitcoin as payment at all shops and restaurants so I need to start looking at current solutions out there right now for making this happen.I think NFC will be ideal as a payment method because we can also use NFC for access to your room and other applications. Even getting to the point that you just have an NFC smart ring that you can wear around the ship.My question is, are there any Bitcoin NFC Point of Sale machines out there for sale or that would like to trial the machines on the ship? I checked out General Bytes ATM and I am impressed by the NFC cards they print out which can be used to make bitcoin payments. I would rather payments be over Lightning Network since it would not make sense to pay for your $3 lunch with a high fee. I have not seen much about NFC lightning payments other than some discussion a few years ago by Igor Cota.The ship will be a micro economy for testing these things out. Let's make it happen and make it happen in such a way that everyone will want to be paying with Bitcoin.Here is a link to the ship page for more info:https://ocean.builders/cruiseship The shares are not a speculative or investment instrument.They are shares of a SeaPod. If 30 people buy a share worth $10,000 they can buy a $300,000 SeaPod and split ownership. I have suddenly become super busy but news of the MS Satoshi is exploding.https://cointelegraph.com/news/cruise-ship-satoshi-to-house-crypto-companies-and-digital-nomadsOur engineer is in Cyprus right now, he says he can see the ship. They should be picking him up in the next couple of hours. 4 COVID tests and 6 days later he made it to Cyprus. Hey guys, yes it will not be so much like your typical cruise. We're even trying to come up with another term than "cruise ship" since it will be stationary. You will need to pay for the things you utilize on the ship (electric, water, food, entertainment, etc.). I agree, it is more like a very small town.Many people think they would get bored quickly but you have to remember that when you are on a cruise, you're not working and you're scrambling to do every little thing during your one week that you can hardly take a break leaving you needing a vacation after your vacation when you get home.But if you're working every day, busy, etc. things will become a lot less boring. As most people were stuck in their apartments for the past 6 months, if they were able to go out and go to a restaurant that would be a step up from the isolation.I like to think of each cabin as your bedroom as suchmoon mentioned. The rest of the ship is your living space.It will likely not be for everyone. That's why we're targeting young folks, perhaps fresh out of college or around there. When I lived in my first apartment it was just big enough for my bed. But I lived next to campus where I spent my day. It is certainly not a 3000 sqft McMansion so we're not targeting people that need that to be happy.My goal is to keep the prices down. We want this ship filled quickly so we can buy our next one while the prices are low.We are likely selling way below what they can go for but we're more enthusiastic about making this work than making big bucks. Every one of the investors could lose the money they put into this and not be too affected. We are in this for the bigger picture.As for the idea of joining 2 or 3 rooms. We're working with the insurance company and will consult with the engineers but I am all for customers buying 2-3 adjoining rooms and opening some walkways. Our main engineer said it mainly depends upon if there is a bulkhead between the rooms, and we need to look into it more but at the very least, a door between rooms should be possible for most cabins. There are already several with that feature.For monthly maintenance fee. That is something I am working with our ship management company, Columbia Cruise Services, to determine the monthly cost to maintain it. They have given me an estimate which is quite high but it is based upon a normal cruise. We are running the numbers and I believe we can get the number down to a reasonable amount so people can live there without needing to be super rich.Part of that monthly maintenance will be covered by the rent we charge for the commercial areas. Bars, restaurants, shops, etc. Again, I want to keep prices down because I want people to live there so if you have to pay $50 for every meal it's not viable. To make up for no kitchens in the rooms we're giving all residents 20% off at the restaurants. This passes some of that cost on to tourists.We'll have each restaurant have buffet options if people want to pay for a meal plan. My wife plans on opening a small Thai restaurant in the food court which will have a few items that would be on the buffet plan which she would be compensated for with her share of the meal plan payments. She would choose some more common foods as "all you can eat" while keeping some specialty/expensive items as optional pay-as-you-go items.The ship is currently in the Mediterranean. Our engineer just left here (Panama) on Friday and will finally be able to board the ship in 2 days after a lot of travel and quarantines. He will stay on until we finish the purchase November 4th, then work with the new crew to sail it here to Panama where it will be anchored.I hope Bitcoin enthusiasts come live on the ship and test out new tech in a micro economy where we can try new things to see how well it works in every day life.Register online, auction begins November 5th.https://ocean.builders/cruiseship We were just talking about a shooting gallery.   Price tag: Over $1 million Still haven't announced it yet so we're just putting together the details. I need to work with the ship management company I hired to work out the costs per cabin. My back of the envelope calculations puts it at a couple hundred dollars monthly per cabin but we have all of October to work that out before sales begin in November.The pictures on the website are just generic pictures right now. We have to have filler material until we actually fly to the ship and take pictures ourselves.Honestly the gym on this ship is not very huge but there is a climbing wall and a running track on the upper deck and we will certainly be focusing on health and self improvement.
The problem with buying a cruise ship has usually been about the cost. COVID allowed us to get a good deal but that won't last forever.Our plan is to have it anchored about 30 minutes from Panama City further conserving costs by not burning much fuel.Near the ship we will put a barge or cargo ship to act as a floating factory to build other floating structures such as Ocean Builders SeaPods and floating islands.It makes sense to try such floating living close to shore first without jumping straight to 200nm out. Living on the water gives some small freedoms we don't have on shore but also comes with other maritime laws we don't have on land. We will need to build communities to benefit from the new system in ways we do not now know.If you were to have the level of hospitality that cruises offer on land it would be expensive as well. We will have to prepare people for the reality that this isn't a vacation, this is your home where you work and pay for your own meals and entertainment. You would get bored of the cruise life after a few weeks. But if you're busy working then it's not much different from living in the dorms at school. Small rooms but most of the time you're out on campus or if you're in your room you're studying your ass off. Yep, that is a render of the actual ship we purchased (which we are not allowed to name) refitted with our logos.245 meters long, 777 cabins.Cabins starting at $25,000. The auction for the rooms starts November 5th.https://ocean.builders/cruiseshipWe'll be accepting bitcoin at all businesses on the ship.

I used to read about how when Venezuela collapsed people had to wait outside the grocery store for very little food.And yet I am now living it and people think everything's fine. Social responsibility and all. We're in this together. The new communism normal and all that.We all knew there would be a second wave too. Everyone knew. Because they had to.

Working my ass off to make it happen. Hopefully things fall into place.  There is no island in the world that is not controlled by a national government.Edit: However, I lived briefly on a remote atoll in French Polynesia and there were very few rules where I lived, breaking up hermit crabs to put on a fishing line to catch my dinner. No Internet, solar for electricity, rain for water. Very simple, nobody to enforce any "laws" other than nature. I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. I get crickets whenever I bring this up.Anti money laundering laws are just "you have to tell the government about every transaction you make" laws.And if you oppose them you're obviously some mob boss trying to move your money from the latest movie style heist. This is great news. I have used them and expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that they're using BitPay. I had to install an electrum wallet just to pay for my hosting. A girl like that is affordable for everyone in this forum.It is just a matter of length of time that differs. Similar to Linux being attacked for not having enough females working on the open source project. Sorry about the dip guys.I ended up blowing my whole wad at Pornhub.

Some sort of image analysis will likely be able to produce an exact likeness of what you look like now.Enjoy your visit from the CIA. My thought process when I decided that I had enough money in bitcoin to retire.I had enough in BTC but not much cash. So I spent my last year of work filling my bank account with dollars to spend so I would have a few years worth of money to live on without dipping into my BTC. I saved up about $80k and retired in 2018, I think I just moved the last of my cash to my spending account last week. Of course living in Thailand was cheap. Living in Panama would have been cheap but I started putting money into Ocean Builders. So I had to dip into my BTC a bit for that.That helped me quite a bit considering the BTC price was below what I felt was worth spending for most of those 2 years.
Kamala Harris is the toughest prosecutor in the US. Half the population of people in jail have her to thank for it.Democrats love police that are tough on crime.

Did Bitcoin get hacked?CEO dead? thisisgentlemen Kids not dying of SIDS while elderly are dying.The only logical conclusion...elderly are sucking the life out of babies to live.  The forum was much different in the early days. People actually all working toward wanting to make Bitcoin successful. Everyone pitching in with ideas and supporting people that were starting businesses and advances for the technology. The major debate was about the depreciation aspect of the currency (from outsiders that did not support Bitcoin). The final answer being..."so you're saying that if I own bitcoin the price will continue to go up. If you truly believe that, why are you not buying bitcoin right now?"Another controversy was SatoshiDice and the flood of transactions on the blockchain for a single gambling website. Interesting...10 years last week for me.July 21, 2010 For our Italian friends."I talenti visionari non mancano, ma nemmeno il senso degli affari fa difetto. Il sito dei Sea Builders offre numerose opzioni di acquisto, affitto o multiproprietà (i Bitcoin sono il mezzo di pagamento preferito, «ma accettiamo anche versamenti via Paypal, e puntiamo, dopo i primi tempi, ad abbattere i costi fino a 195 mila dollari per un modulo, un prezzo alla portata dellamericano medio» spiega Grant)."https://www.iodonna.it/attualita/storie-e-reportage/2020/07/25/seasteading-case-del-futuro-in-mare/ Just remember that as things get harder for people they will tend toward seeking support from their "group" or collective. Whatever that may be, it is easy to stand strong as an individual when things are going well but when times are tough you need to feel like there are others out there providing whatever you feel you are missing.In the US this appears to be falling into the categories of race as the groups people are choosing. Nationalism tends to be a very significant group that people will fall back on. Or people will trend toward their socioeconomic class if there is some sort of movement or prevalence of it.Their enemies will be anyone outside of their group. The best way to solidify yourself within that group is to attack someone outside of that group, the more publicly the better, the more unlike your group the better.It is a symptom, not a cause. It will become worse. Lines will be drawn. Groups defined more solidly. I've even noticed this with libertarian folks online that are supposed to be individualists, falling into the comfort of attacking "statists" among their libertarian peers. Capital Gains tax holidayhttps://americanindependent.com/larry-kudlow-tax-cuts-coronavirus-stimulus-donald-trump-economy-capital-gains-covid-19/Step 1: Cash out all bitcoin on Capital Gains tax holidayStep 2: Buy all bitcoin back the next day...Step 4: Pay capital gains only on the price at current levels instead of on $100/BTC. To renounce my citizenship would require paying taxes on the total value of all of my bitcoin holdings as if I sold them the day I renounced. The thought of the amount of brown skinned people in far off lands who's skin will be burned off using my money does not sit well with me.My thought is that the US will collapse in the next few years so it is not necessary to renounce my citizenship. US citizenship will cease to exist. Then I can just not sign onto the America 2 (the electric boogaloo) citizenship.But not to worry. I filed this year so when you leave your house in the morning there will be roads. So I have tried a few times to download the Coinbase app needed to sign up for the Coinbase debit card. Each time I get "This is not supported in your country".I use a VPN to set my IP in the US so is it not supported in the US? Or is it somehow detecting that I'm really in Panama?Also, I finally got around to filing my extortion papers for the IRS.Getting married helped keep me from needing to pay any taxes. Land of the free...where you have to file your taxes even if you haven't stepped foot in the country all year. I put the numbers in my calculator and came up with 58008 Interesting. My needs are the opposite (need to be able to spend my BTC) but this is a good way for people to onboard to LN with ease. Maybe their debit card could allow for that.I tried to link my bank account but it did not accept my credentials. Hopefully it is not farming my bank login/password. Not that I put much in the bank. Exactly. I do have a bidet actually.Or as we call them in Thailand...a bum gun.Fact: Leprosy exists (about 200,000 people as of 2016).Fact: Leprosy is transmitted via touch.Fact: If you are walking around in a full suit of armor, nobody can touch you. Fact: If you are not walking around in a full suit of armor, somebody can touch you (and thus, you could potentially catch leprosy).Fact: You will eventually die. People using pants as an example of why wearing masks is normal. They don't understand that I have never fully accepted that wearing pants should be required either.Also...leprosy exists. If a leper touches you, you will catch it. That is why everyone in ancient times walked around in full plate mail.If you are not walking around in a full suit of armor you can catch leprosy and eventually die. Let that little fact sink in. Last I looked at the price (a few hours ago) the price was $9689...now the price is $9691...Any reason for the $2 jump? Perhaps Social Security could be paid our depending upon the amount of years you were voting age and the debt went up. Pay first toward paying down that debt, anything left over can be distributed in social security checks.Win win for everyone I'd say."But I paid into that my whole life!"Ya, you also took more than you paid in your whole life as well. Time to pay back. I keep my capital gains under the level required to have a tax rate of 0%. It used to be $35k which was fine living in Thailand. Now I am married so that is now just over $70k. Plenty of income for me per year. It's fairly cheap living here in Panama.Speaking of, we are considering eventually moving to somewhere in the US. Does anyone know of which state has the lowest/almost zero property taxes?
It's not like they need to stage a cop killing a black guy for any sort of false flag. That stuff happens so often you may as well stage a false flag of a liquor store getting robbed.The key is to prepare the hype. Just like Corona virus...take something that is common, hype it up to make it seem like something huge, make sure people are scared...more government.  Yes, the cop did well to try to hide himself. He likely didn't think someone would get as close to him as they did. And when they did he said "do you want to get arrested?". And when someone screams "Are you a cop?" he responds "does it matter?".Certainly there is not any "proof" at this point, all speculation. We know that the police will not be investigating this guy. If they were trying to find who it is then that would lend some credibility to the fact that this guy is likely not a cop. But they aren't.The two points here that would provide the proof would be the guy on twitter who received the girl's text messages getting proof of whom it was and having her verify that it was her and that she knows it was him.A freedom of information act release of the body camera for Pederson at the time of the window breaking would provide the proof that he was not involved as the police department stated.There were two quick investigations into this.The first one being the guy releasing the video, someone took a still of the video to show the guy close up, someone else sees it and sends a text to the girl asking if it was "Jake" (not Jacob as a lazy scammer trying to set someone up would do), this person getting confirmation then posting the text on twitter as a follow up to the picture posted. Occam's razor puts this as the simplest explanation for those chain of events.The scam version would be. Guy puts the video up, someone puts up a still picture. Someone else searches to find someone in the St Paul police department that could possibly look like the guy in the close up knowing that if they get a better image their little scam will be destroyed, they come up with some fake text messages coming up with a new story about how those are her gloves, her mask, throws in the nickname of "Jake" on the assumption that this guy goes by the name "Jake" with friends, which would also destroy his scam if people close to the guy verify that nobody calls him that. They then send it to the twitter guy who has many followers and would be able to easily verify the identity of the person sending the text messages. The second investigation was from the police department. They see some posts about one of their own being outted as the window smasher. They spend about 30 minutes figuring out what to say. They post an announcement that the guy was not Jacob Pederson. End of investigation.  And for some reason Umbrella Man comes back to the Autozone later.https://twitter.com/Dymanh/status/1265818108339650560 Certainly not proof. The source would need to verify this is truly from his "friend in Minny".Here's a video by the "pizza guy" claiming he's not a cop.Comment below mentions the guy is a local actor.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=86&v=qWK5fSbp7MM&feature=emb_title  I've been trying to get proof that this guy is a cop.Updating the thread here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5252422.0I just ran a facial recognition program against it but with his nose covered up it comes back as a 66% match. The his picture photoshopped over the guy's exposed face comes back with a 76% match. So inconclusive so far.My question would be...there were so many people taking video that day, all day. I would think if everyone had their video online they would be able to figure out where the guy went. I watched the video where he claims private military is coming to DC. Most comments are asking where he got his information. He said to Google "private military Washington DC" and check under News.I did. I don't see anything. Any further information on this?I know that in Iraq the mercenaries were used to bust in doors and do things the US military was not allowed to do because of treaties and such. I think I was close to being hired for one such company but I had to turn down the job because they needed my to quit my job that Friday and start weapons training that Monday. They could not tell me what I would be doing. I told them I needed to give my company 2 weeks notice. Strange. You are the second person I have seen that looked at a picture of someone showing either the mask photoshopped over the picture on the left, or the eyes copied over to the picture on the right who has said "That's photoshop!".Umm...that's the point. Researchers Retract Botched Anti- Hydroxychloroquine Study Which Was Used To Attack Trumphttps://www.zerohedge.com/health/researchers-retract-botched-anti-hcq-study-which-caused-who-halt-trials?fbclid=IwAR3Cl5FudBlARIWRbdP2kTq2ftnVNbeNtjM7EzS6dk78Ow1QCK4C3VsS8LAFortunately the authors of the study offered you an apology."We all entered this collaboration to contribute in good faith and at a time of great need during the Covid-19 pandemic," said the authors. "We deeply apologize to you, the editors, and the journal readership for any embarrassment or inconvenience that this may have caused."What is so damned sad about all of this is the amount of people truly rooting against HCQ as a cure. Like they seriously hope it doesn't save one damned life. It's time for a bit of introspection if you don't want HCQ to cure sick people just to score political points.I'd never take it. I was given a year's supply when I went to Afghanistan, twice, and I never took it. I am not a drug user so if I catch COVID I would rather fight it without doing drugs. But if it's going to save people that have destroyed their bodies throughout their lives, then that is some great damned news. That is something I would hope to be true.We will see in 2 weeks if the hotspots for all of these protests see a huge surge in COVID patients. That is the real thing to watch. We are the new wealthy elites gentlemen. I've heard great things about them spreading freedom in other countries. Finally they will be sent into US cities to spread some of that freedom. Police force confirmed that he was working in the area at the time. Claims he was not sent out to break windows for them. That is even worse than if they had not provided the alibi. Because if it was him, that means it was under orders, not just him going rogue.Had there not been a video of George Floyd being murdered by a cop posts in this thread about him dying while under police custody would be all like "he had an underlying condition", "you have no proof that the police had anything to do with it", "he hung himself with his shirt". As the police force all gets behind whatever alibi the police officer that murdered him made up. Conspiracy or not, is it not important to find out the identity of the white guy that sparked riots across the US?There are a lot of people pissed off about what this one white guy did to ignite the spark.It's pretty simple to take the picture of the guy's eyes and see that they are the same guy.As someone did here:https://twitter.com/Kenny28356852/status/1266439048094253057Some guy at the police department who's salary is almost twice that of the average policeman's salary...who has been protected in the past by the police department for shooting an unarmed victim.Perhaps it is just some random white guy...let's find out who it is. He triggered a huge hit to the US economy. This guy spray painted "Free stuff for everyone zone" on the side of the Autozone near the police station before breaking the windows. Akin to shouting fire in a crowded movie theater.This act sparked riots across the US destroying businesses more than the government already had during their plandemic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAnXlUfB7VIDon't you think that it's important to know who he is? He's obviously not one of the peaceful protesters. Wouldn't you think the government would want to know who he is?In the video it shows that he walks around the back of the Autozone and cuts out as he's going toward the corner.But what is beyond that? What building was he so quick to get to? There are only 2 buildings in that direction...Target and the police station. The front of Target was far to his right from that corner...he could have easily crossed the parking lot which would have been safer for him instead of getting stuck between the cars on the route he was taking. The only other building nearby was the police station.Many people believe it was a police officer. This should be something the police would want to know right? Are they searching for this man?I believe it is important to know if this person is a police officer. The US public deserves an answer. We have the Internet now. Surely someone can find out who he is.Also, I know that the police station where this guy likely works said "oh no, that guy was working that day...in that area...but that wasn't him. He was doing something else". At least they confirmed he was doing official police business in that area that day.Edit:This video shows that he does walk toward Target.Strangely enough pink shirt guy is following him, laughing when umbrella man calls him a police officer.https://twitter.com/Kenny28356852/status/1266439048094253057 Was it the underlying conditions that killed him? Or the COVID?Oh ya, we're talking about the Floyd case...Was it the underlying conditions that killed him? Or the boot on the neck? Statists gonna state. So I did some searching to see if this was already in the works and I ran across Guardian Circlehttps://guardiancircle.com/It's an app that you install, then connect with your friends and family locally. If you have an emergency you click the big 'Alert' button and every one of your "guardians" gets an alert. This then turns into a chat room where everyone can respond and you can give more details about what the emergency is. Once the incident is over you can award responders with their Guard token. It also keeps a record of the event for use later on if needed as evidence.This interview goes into the goals of the app:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWAXFBddY2YBasically they hope to get subscription services set up so that you can pay to add either EMTs or trained security guards as your guardians. I installed the app and it's pretty straight forward. You'll need to have people you want to contact in an emergency also install it. At least if Brazil legalizes guns we can start seriously considering it as a seastead destination.The Atlantic Ocean off of Brazil is a vast open area with no hurricanes and low waves.We have not considered it due to the crime. Or...why a certain part of society champions disarming the population... What if I told you, in 2050 they will not need to read to see what we were thinking..."brain interface....please download everything in the Internet archives from 2010 to 2030 related to Bitcoin"
The more early coins get spent the better for Bitcoin in the long run.Old coins hanging over everyone's head makes them more significant the higher the price goes.When an old wallet is the GDP of a country...it affects many lives if someone finally decides to start spending their stash. I see franky1 continues calling me a scammer.Whichever, slander away if it makes you feel good about yourself.Actions are what we rely on. I would certainly not encourage someone to buy a seapod without first coming down and seeing for yourself firsthand what we are doing here. As several people already have.Anyone is welcome (once the lockdown is lifted).  Sold my house. Put all the money from the sale toward BTC at around $660.Bet the house. Why would anyone go to the DEA? Looking for blood money?The days of the CIA funding drug operations to bolster the drug war to move more money to the narcotics agencies is over. The drug war is lost. They've moved on from terrorism to now they can just print trillions and divvy it up among the agencies without any fairy tales other than a virus. They'll milk this one for all it's worth. The drug war is but ancient history. It is no longer of any use. Send me 1 BTC and I will give you the secret of how you can make 1 BTC from random strangers on the Internet. I think a hurricane would be a big hit to the cruise industry. During this downtime a lot of them are docked in the Bahamas and Cayman. Many are sitting in one place in the open sea.With a hurricane they will need a crew to move the ship. They will need to spend money on staying out of the hurricane's path while they have no money coming in.The cruise industry is toast. They are doing all they can to keep afloat (pun intended). Letting people purchase cruises 3 years ahead of time, allowing people to cancel within 48 hours of their trip to reschedule (cheap cabins about to open up if you can do a last minute cruise).Then there's the air industry. They're talking about taking out middle seats so they can put spacers in, cutting back flights to 20%...prices are going to skyrocket.Tourism will take a huge hit. My retirement plans were based on working until I had $1.5 million.$250k was for a home that was as self sufficient as possible so that my monthly bills were just mainly property taxes, internet, insurance, etc. Electricity from solar, water from rain/well.$250k was for a business or investment to draw a regular pay. I figured something that I would need to put some time into but still be able to have free time. With a 10% return...$25k per year of spending money.$1 million for when I am 65 or so (time to truly retire). That money would go into an investment that I would draw from when I am ready to stop "working".Fortunately while I was accumulating all of this money I put it directly into bitcoin.My floating house in the ocean was better than a home where I only pay property taxes, insurance, etc. My only expense out there was $20 per month for Internet. I could have $10-$100 million in bitcoin and I'd still follow this strategy of low monthly expenses and saving the bulk for when I'm much older.I'd rather sacrifice luxury to never have to go work in a cubicle ever again. 41 minutes later...630001 goes through. It was a good run.Close the book on this venture.Not enough reward. Happy halfling! With inflation rate currently at 1.8%, bitcoin's inflation is just below the stated goal for the inflation rate of the dollar at 2%. Atlas Countdown video for the halving...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMJUchV6rgo Is there a website like blockchain.info that includes the block reward amount? I always assumed it went back to the original thread ofI am pretty confident we are the new wealthy elite, gentlemen.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12156.0 The havling is different.You know how Bitcoin uses public keys that are really long like: 3Fsjzp0kJ5AbQaogMsdFh9Jaqhh3k114Pwgbs?The havling means it gets cut in half.So now your key will only be: 3Fsjzp0kJ5AbQaogMsPeople are excited because it makes everything a lot easier.Every 4 years it will havle. Until all public keys are only one letter so it's super easy to use. Roleplay games use gold. 4 hours until all bitcoins get cut in half. I don't recall ever engaging in this thread.I'm like the lone hero that walks through the store letting out a silent but deadly, walking out before anyone knows what just happened. Supporting the hype while understanding history can only mean that you want concentration camps and gas chambers. If you can't see the obviousness of it all then you're only supporting tyranny via ignorance.The gas chambers this time around will be a softer gentler approach...Vaccines utilizing radical new technology that's never been tested will do the trick in a much easier way. They're already implementing plenty of measures to ensure people get the vaccine without forcing them. But they will be given little to no choice.
Not enough people on MINDS yet.If you get news from the broadcast media then you are correct, we are not in the same world. I mainly watch LBRY channels these days. I accept that those that support freedom need to downplay the crisis out of necessity. I also accept that those that support tyranny need to unnecessarily overhype the crisis.Hence, you go up and down your Facebook page and see the same people posting low COVID death numbers who also post links to how maybe Iran didn't do <insert bad thing the US claims they did to push for WW3>. The same people screaming about millions of possible deaths are the same ones that say that the PATRIOT Act was a perfectly reasonable response that is still necessary 20 years after 19 individuals orchestrated an attack.People would not need to downplay the numbers if they knew that those that want to control their lives were going to try to use the crisis to control their lives. People who want to control your life would not be overhyping the numbers if they had some dogs they could torture to keep their appetite satiated for power.Now...if people who truly are all about this COVID thing being an actual true threat that they believe in their hearts is going to end humanity (and they get past the fact that they don't really care about humanity going away)...then they should propose free market solutions that would give people more freedom while fighting the virus.Propose ways to save lives and save us from a deadly virus while at the same time decentralizing power and empowering individuals. If you care...this is what you do. I'm not sure why I have to keep bringing this up for every "crisis" but...if you people that hate freedom would quit using every crisis as an excuse to institute even more tyranny (like you did with the last crisis) then those of us who love freedom wouldn't be fighting you on this.You could say "hey gang, this virus is bad...we should all socially distance" and we'd be like..."that sounds reasonable, we can do that temporarily then get back on with things as they were before". The crisis would pass, things would go back to normal.But instead it's "hey dissenters, stay at home or we'll arrest you...also we need to institute a new normal where drones are flying around monitoring everyone and we're spending $1 trillion a week while deciding who can work and who cannot"...to the response of "fuck your crisis...we don't believe anything you say".Remember that for the next crisis...because you'll care oh so much about people in the next crisis too and we will yet again not follow along with your ideas about how "everybody should do X". Nothing to see here. Everyone is following government orders. Don't leave your house. Wear a mask in bed. Wash your hands.  Liechtenstein had a total lockdown and their deaths were only 2905 from COVID. So obviously total lockdown is the way to go considering the number of deaths is lower. Then I would have to go back in in 2 days to put my sell order back at $99k.Just in case. Everyone who wants to take Bill Gates' vaccine....really should.Like...please do. I (if I controlled the government) would have done the same thing the government does during a bad flu season.If I also controlled the government I would likely use the crisis as an opportunity to turn the health care system into a completely decentralized blockchain aided free market system.If it was truly a bad pandemic people would be able to buy respirators (or 3D print their own), have a negative pressure room in their home/garage/basement, and AirBnB the hospital space. Uber Doctors and Nurses that come and check on patients and give monitoring advice to AirBnBs.While I have also been control of the government I then turn every law enforcement agency into a blockchain based P2P service where if you need a threat managed you get on your app which uses AI to automatically contact the closest threat managers to deal with your particular situation until a private investigator can come in and gather evidence which is then utilized for an Augr type of trial to determine if the victim requires compensation from the accused.After being given such supreme power over the government I would work until my position is no longer necessary and the market has fulfilled all roles from my central place of authority down to the smallest individual. "a 1 percent increase in the unemployment rate will be associated with 37,000 deaths [including 20,000 heart attacks], 920 suicides, 650 homicides, 4,000 state mental hospital admissions and 3,300 state prison admissions."The unemployment rate currently sits at 15% and growing.There was an increase in suicides in 2009 due to the recession. Except how their hospitals are under a central government control.https://www.vox.com/2020/4/3/21207310/coronavirus-new-york-hospitals-andrew-cuomo?utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link&ICID=ref_farkI didn't even know about this until just now but I assumed that the high number of deaths had to do with some sort of government intervention. Sure enough...there it is. Anyone with a history book knows that socialism kills people aggressively. So if people truly don't want people dying...try less socialism. But...I know, you really don't care about people dying. You care about the fear that you can use to spread more government. If you cared about life you'd be all about supporting life extension technology, allowing a free market health care system, encouraging population growth...Are you new to economic downturns? First time? Yes, like I want to be one of Bill Gates' beta testers for his innovative new vaccine. Because when you get injected with something it's best if it is untested and innovative. You should use credit to buy bitcoins. Go deep in fiat debt to be crypto positive. How is this an unpopular post? You are posting the government narrative that is being pushed right now. They even have pictures.But what will likely happen in the US is people are sick of the lockdowns, they see that the US dun goofed after seeing the results in Sweden obtaining herd immunity.So...lift the sanctions, sorry about the thousands of deaths due to unemployment and job loss...time to do like Sweden and just get over it once and for all instead of this screwing around with peoples' lives for a few people in nursing homes that are on their death beds.The curve will not be as high as in Sweden due to a small percentage of the population already having it already.Will a lot of people in the socialist New York health care system die...oh yes...many many people in New York. So many New Yorkers will feel the first hand results of government intervention into their health. That really sucks. A microcosm of communism as a demonstration of what not to do. Perhaps useful as an example for the rest of the country of what not to do to your health care.Now that is the unpopular opinion. It is my well thought out theory (like 30 seconds of thought) that John McCaffee is responsible for COVID-19 and the hype behind it to collapse the economy. He pushed for the printing of trillions of dollars by the Fed and the overall destruction of the dollar.Yes, you guessed it.So we will reach $1 million bitcoin price by the end of 2020 (Even though $1 million won't buy you much).All so he doesn't have to eat his own dick.You saw it here first.Proof in the form of a video with mysterious music and ominous graphics coming soon. So...Google's new algorithm is censoring Bitcoin just as we go into the next uptrend.https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2020/05/06/google-algorithm-update-did-google-just-censor-bitcoin/#70252dcf31f0Switch to:https://lbry.tvhttps://duckduckgo.comhttps://protonmail.com 5 figures pleases mePurse.io still being open pleases me.Just put in an order my wife has been preparing for the past month. Though the low price gave me an excuse to tell her she couldn't shop. I would not be surprised by a downward bart at this point. This is Bitcoin. Be ready for anything.I would also not be surprised if at the halving the price stagnates then falls when people need to pay their bills.There are a lot of people right now buying because people are proclaiming "the halvening! price to the moon!". People new to Bitcoin are buying based on the promise of riches. Then when those riches do not come, they will be re-thinking things when bills come due. Or if there is a dip and they get scared. They will FOMO down just as they FOMO up. Over $9k. According to this chart the past 2 halvings have been followed soon after by an insignificant dip. Insignificant long term but at the time felt like a letdown due to the hope that the price would rise right after the halving. There was a jump right after the first halving due to the scare that the halving would cause the end of Bitcoin due to miners stopping mining. When they didn't stop the price jumped a little. Before easing back down. I remember selling about 400 bitcoins after that quick jump to $12 (all the bitcoins I owned). It's not about flattening the curve, it's about people not dying from COVID-19.Why do you want people to die?!?Unless COVID-19 is gone from Earth we all need to stay inside and listen to our government rulers. It is for your safety.Wash your hands.
It's over 9000. I am so glad I copyrighted the vegeta meme(copyright 2018: Elwar).After it flies past the ATH(tm) I'm going to go back and collect bitcoins from all of those newly rich bitcoiners(patent pending). I already have to wear a mask everywhere (the 4 hours a week I'm "allowed" out of the house). I made the unlucky choice of moving to the strictest country in the world during this virus.I also found out during this whole thing that I cannot criticize the government here by law. Or I risk being deported (if my wife is deported she will be killed).So...happy thoughts, great government, wash your hands, shelter in place, thank you for your service doctors and nurses, wash your hands...I am literally jealous of people living in North Korea after hearing that they started flooding the electronics and liquor stores when they found out Kim Jung Un may be dead. These are places I cannot go to. This. If everyone else is wearing a mask your chance of catching it from someone with the virus is only 5%. And if you are not practically dead or immune compromised your chances of dying after you catch it are .0001%.So don't wear the mask. Make everyone else wear one.But wear one if you're 90 and on your death bed. Comparing COVID19 to the flu is not fair to those dying of the flu. You can only be responsible on an individual basis. If you punch someone and that makes them mad, then they go punch someone else...the second victim cannot seek damages from you.What is required is that the victim can prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the infector infected them.Sure, not something you can really do with today's technology. But with enough time and technology it would be possible. Perhaps a blood monitoring technology that can detect the specific time in which you were infected. Combine that with some app on your phone/recording glasses that records who you were in contact with at the time. This gives a likely source. It may also record things you touch, etc. If you're in a store and you determine that you caught it at that store due to poor hygiene you can bring charges against the store. The store could then also record people entering and touching those same places and locate the source.If we reached such technology we could eradicate almost any disease. You would likely immediately know about any disease you have and you would immediately self quarantine to ensure that you do not spread the virus so that you are not held liable.In Iceland they had a private court system. Killing someone unintentionally had a set price you had to pay to the victim's family. Or the victim's family was able to set the punishment. For murder it sometimes meant becoming an "outlaw" which meant you were no longer under protection of the law, including if someone murdered you. Also anyone who helped you was considered an outlaw as well (even going to buy food at the store).People who could not pay their debts to the victim were indeed required to work off their debt. In a technology future you could just set a smart contract to send X amount of funds to the victim for every receipt of payment (this would be done voluntarily by the accused to stay within the community) until the debt is paid off.By the government taking over the responsibility of individuals, there is no motivation to move toward holding people responsible for their own actions. And people who are not harming anyone are being punished for no reason at all. I agree. Just like sources of pollution used to be tracked and the polluters sued. An industry of pollution detectives were just starting to spring up when the industrial age was just beginning. Fearing a total shutdown of the economy corporations worked with the government to create the EPA which protected the polluters in exchange for some superficial regulations and payoffs.If we could track the spread of diseases and hold those people responsible accountable we could stop disease.I mean...we know the 4 or so people that brought it to the US right? So they say. Start with them. "the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis"Some state and local legislators are about to get served. I hope the legislators start becoming more afraid of the people than the virus.Their echo chamber just got shattered. I haven't watched the show yet but I lived in that part of Florida. I remember the Tiger reserve (passed it on the way to work).Having lived there...ya...nothing would surprise me about the people there. I think it is partly yankee rejects from New Jersey (and Michigan) coming down thinking they're smarter than the locals, partly the prevalence of oxy prescription mills, partly people thinking "spring break was so fun, I should move here!" and then they actually do...then have no idea what to do after that.I got out alive... This may be part of why the price shot up.Lebanon banks literally on fire.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/banks-targeted-lebanon-night-molotov-200429060510405.html Maybe we can go full decentralization akin to Uber or AirBnB.Have trained security or bodyguards register on a site then get paid for their security services akin to ordering an Uber. Bring in security for an event, hire a guard for a localbitcoins trade, get them to your house in an emergency, etc.On call, peer to peer police service. No overhead, money goes directly to the security (even better than Uber...blockchain based). I would encourage for all of the female accounts.Though yes, that would also likely qualify them as dumb. This unstable world is demonstrating that we need it now more than ever.Before all but 500 million of us are depopulated. I have friends asking how to convert money from their IRA to bitcoin.Is this possible yet? The odds of this are very likely. So likely in fact that I am willing to part with a few bitcoins for 1/10th of the amount.Offer ends soon. So...the first price doubling has happened... If you love your current government that's great. If you think you can just get rid of government, that's not going to happen. But if you create an alternative option...then you're on the right track.Bitcoin is not about ending the Fed. It is about replacing the Fed. We need this for every implementation of government. Starting at the bottom should be the easiest.  I think this scene sums up the reaction of the media and governments to the data coming out that COVID-19 is not as deadly as first projected."How can you be so obtuse? Is it deliberate?"Government: "Solitary! A month!"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wREOySaxU Damn...Kim Jung Un dies just as the world turns into North Korea.Maybe he died happy knowing that we are all North Koreans now.
True...but government tends to centralize when getting control. If the local governments benefit from a cheaper and almost free option for some of their services then more money can be directed to their tithing toward their kings or dictators to get in favor of their masters.And as decentralization makes everything more and more efficient, we'll just have one single dictator at the center who will eventually become irrelevant. They slice away our freedoms bit by bit. We need to decentralize governance bit by bit. I met Dale Brown who runs Detroit's Threat Management Center. His company is a great example of taking control where the public police have failed (inner Detroit).The mayor is required to support the local police over his service but has begrudgingly acknowledged that crime in the district where his team works has fallen significantly since he began.But they do work in parallel with the local police. He told me the police are just fine with his company being involved. They're fine with it because they're not looking to get shot in the line of duty so if Dale's company gets to the scene first and can calm things down before they get there...all the better.He collects a fee, gives out a phone number to call (after you've called 911). They're usually there before the police. The fee is higher for businesses, and the businesses are willing to pay it to keep their community low on crime. The poorer areas can pay a much smaller fee (or free) as this helps to lower crime in the area.Where I live in Panama there is very little police protection. It's pretty much up to each home owner to protect themselves. This is difficult as guns are mostly illegal. This results in a lot of high fences, bars on the windows, dogs everywhere...solely used for guarding the home (not as pets). The local marina pays for security so it's not like this is a new concept. Just expanded a bit. This government power grab that we are experiencing is the worst parts of Communist China spreading throughout the world like a...virus.One silver lining in all of this is that people are at home, not making any money, no income, no money for governments. Hopefully this means the crumbling of governments along with the crumbling of the economy.So instead of complaining or whining about government, it is necessary to provide an alternative solution that is better.Sure, plenty of people will come to this threat propping up their shitcoin "my coin that I invested in and want to get rich off of allows for governance and voting, so you should buy some so I can sell it and buy a lambo with fiat!".But we need an innovative decentralized blockchain solution for local governments that local governments would want to adopt or find it necessary to adopt as they begin struggling with revenue.It could certainly start small. The most basic function of government is protection of life and property. This could be done with an opt-in "insurance" that you pay which adds you to a list of people that are protected. The protection company would consist of two different companies.The first company is threat management such as the private company Threat Management Center. This company already exists in Detroit. They are paid by businesses and wealthy people which subsidize lower income families in the same area (the idea being that if crime is kept down overall, then the businesses and wealthy benefit from a crime free area...criminals are discouraged from moving into the area).Detroit's Threat Management Center sends someone out to do exactly as advertised...manage threats. If there is an immediate concern they are called to the scene. They usually arrive before the police and de-escalate  the situation. They show up to stop a husband beating his wife, someone breaking into the property, a fight, etc. That's all they need to do. Just manage the threat and make sure things have stopped.The second company would be private detectives. They are the ones that gather evidence, find proof of the crime, find out whom did what to whom. They gather the evidence for the victim.Both companies could certainly exist under current law, there is no interference with current police forces but they could certainly exist without it. Communities would feel safe and threats to life and property would be managed.There could then be similar decentralized versions of jury trials (augur prediction market, private arbitration, etc.). Jails could either fall under the current structure or some system of compensation for the victims via contract could be put into place (which is still under the current system). If people contractually agree to follow the decentralized rules then those that violate those rules could be put into jail under this same system while still being under current laws.There are several options for allowing for management of these companies. Some sort of contractual agreement or services that you pay for (I like Threat management company A so I'll pay them instead of company B who I am no longer satisfied with).We used to have private detectives, they used to be prevalent. A decentralized way of paying detective insurance, linking the detectives with victims could provide a resurgence.Of course it would need to be super easy for each person in the community to be involved even if it's Grandma sending a check in the mail to a payment processor that converts things to the tokens used for the system.Self moderated to keep out the troll. Moved to moderated topic due to troll. Looks great. Getting things imported is a...process. If I ordered that I'm not sure when I would ever get it. And how much I would pay in shipping. Here in Panama we are locked down very tight. It has progressively gotten more strict. At the moment, men can only go out on Tuesday and Thursday for 2 hours each day. Women on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Saturday is full lockdown. It didn't start like this.I live about an hour from the closest grocery store. The last time (a few weeks ago) I went into town the lines outside the main grocery stores were very long (with people all bunched up next to each other) so I went to the smaller shops that sell meat. The meat in Panama is not very good, very tough (I tried dry aging but that did not go well my first try). The beef was gone at that store, half of the food on the shelves was gone.So I took the 2.5 hour drive to Panama City where they have one of those "Costco" types of stores while I have a special piece of paper that allows me to go into the city. I waited in line outside the store with all of the other men for about an hour (I barely made it into the store within my time window with the guy at the door telling me I have to be out in 20 minutes to be within my time slot).Most of the food in that store likely comes from the US. Panama is not a farming country. I found out the reason it is not a farming country is due to the inability for farmers to be able to protect their farms from scavengers stealing their food (the locals are mostly thieves of opportunity).I do not see this lockdown being lifted until at least June. I don't know how much more strict they will get. That may have been the last time I was able to go to the city to buy food until this is over. And at that point...will the supply lines still be there? I'm sure if food is scarce in the US they will not want to export.Sure, I can survive...I live on the ocean and can fish (illegally but they aren't cracking down), I have fruit trees, we grow veggies, etc.But we're still building our seastead factory in spite of only being allowed out of our homes for 4 hours a week.We stay out of our homes so that you can have the option of a future away from tyranny. They always show these super cool and fun looking boats on water that is super calm. A study was already done on UV light therapy. It likely did not live up to the hopes of the researchers as no results were published after the clinical trial.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02785133 Just went to the bulk food store and bought about $1k worth of food (mainly meat) and vitamins.They were out of freezers otherwise I would have bought one (and more meat).Things like this are why I did bitcoin. Not to buy a lambo. I think at this point people just want to see what happens if you lock people up for months on end. A masochistic form of entertainment. I'm sure there's some psychological definition for it.People slow down for car accidents.This is like people saying we need more laws making cars go faster...just so they can watch the carnage. After seeing how easily so many people of the world can be fooled by wrong math it helps me to understand why so many people buy shitcoins.The whole world has just bought the COVID-19 coin the same way that so many people bought Bitconnect.It's like those Facebook posts that show: 1+x = 2, x = ?  and the comments going on and on are all different answers, none of them right. These low prices are lame.Fix it. I created a private key and deliberately deleted the first character.I will have to wait until quantum computing reaches the insane amount of calculations it would require to figure out what my private key is. I hope I am still alive by then. Great study of a very large study of 3 people out of 84 dying while on HCQ alone.Completely dispels the doctor who has treated 700 patients with a cocktail of Hydroxychloroquine, Zinc Sulfate and Azithromycin at 100% success rate.Of course, Trump only mentioned HCQ so it is of utmost important to find the one instance where they only used HCQ...because that's what Trump said and this whole lockdown is about proving Trump wrong. I saw this on CNN...a bunch of rangers in South Dakota breaking social distancing laws. Are there any bitcoin charts priced in oil out there?Moon? Excellent news. Herd immunity usually kicks in around 65-70%.So if we can infect that many people who have no symptoms, this thing will be wrapped up quite nicely quite quickly.Lock up the immune compromised and let everyone out of their cages.End of the pandemic. Thanks for the great numbers. We're out of the woods on this now. WTF. This blows. Will there be no way to spend bitcoins soon? I used that site all the damned time. I had a big Amazon order ready for when the price got back to a decent range.First BitPay, Expedia, now Purse.Bitrefill and Cheapair may be the final Bitcoin companies holding up a multi-billion dollar currency. Episode 8 of "The First Seasteaders" series is out proving that we are innocent of all charges:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYgy88-HI8I I had a friend who said he fucked a bat once.He couldn't walk for a week.#homo
I am starting to see that I should really not be recommending bitcoin to my general Facebook friends anymore.As truly horrible people have proven themselves to be at math, they'd probably end up owning some shitcoin within hours of buying their first bitcoin.If I were so inclined I would certainly get super rich off of these people. At least I stopped trying to protect their freedom. hilarious Definitely no normal please.End socialized medicine so we can adapt to the curve next time instead of letting government screw us.I seem to recall something about the American Revolution happening in the time of smallpox... Heard an interesting theory today.What if the singularity is already here.And this whole thing is just some AI trying something out.I personally am impressed at how quickly whomever is behind all of this shut down the world so quickly and so easily.I would not be surprised if some very wealthy guy just won a bet. And coffee.Going to those meetings it was so obvious that people still did not get it. They had no control over their own body's urges. They just replaced alcohol with coffee and cigarettes (among other things).One person mentioned that most alcoholics are actually addicted to drama so they like to stir things up in their own way without using alcohol to do it. My late wife was an alcoholic so I learned a lot about it, went to several AA meetings with her, etc.I will never be with an alcoholic again and I finally understand the ANON philosophy of just leaving them behind.As a test with anyone new I meet, I buy a full case, bottle or whichever when they stay over. I give them every option to continue drinking as much as they want. If they can stop before it's all gone...they're likely not an alcoholic.Someone at an AA meeting once told a story, they were talking to a friend who said they bought a six pack, had a few beers then went to sleep. The whole room unanimously had in their mind "what about the rest of the beer?".To have 2 beers then stop is not something an alcoholic tends to do. They 'can' do it...but likely will not happen. So, I used to be admin on "the obama forums". A website that was dripping in satire as we all acted like "over the top" Obama supporters trolling pretty much anyone coming to the site in a thinly veiled manner.What would be good forum name for today's statist whack jobs that are all for loading up dissenters into paddy wagons and hauling them off to concentration camps?the statist forums is a bit obvious...statists don't call themselves thatWhat type of website would you boot licker types go to and discuss how much you love your government's reaction to the corona virus? Come to find out...that $1200 stimulus check is just a loan. To be paid back in your 2020 taxes. Call me when we surpass 2009's H1N1 deaths at 575,000 under Obama when the media was more focused on his Nobel Peace Prize than "they're dying!".Where did they bury the bodies then? In this round of "who gets to die by the millions", the vaxxers win.https://www.sciencealert.com/an-invisible-quantum-dot-tattoo-is-being-suggested-to-id-vaccinated-kids/amp?fbclid=IwAR0zwf8EpNFZebe9nUnjvLDCxrTGEEHxFMrpCYEjDd3GkgwLxsNFIqNHoQMGet your tattoos. Sad to see a fallen brother.RIP Bruno Is there any place to pay people to do some art for you, or have a contest for artists to submit their art?I know you can do a contest on freelancer and ask for digital visuals. But I was wondering if there was a place specifically for artists of all mediums, not just digital.I figure I'd see about commissioning some artistic representation for what we went through in Thailand...something I could hang on the wall. Since people have time on their hands.But I don't have any favorite artists or even know what I would want. Same.Speakeasies on the rise. Welcome to the 20s. The bill was already passed, the money is already stolen. Your protest should have happened then, not after. If everyone refuses their $1200, they'll just put that money toward another Kennedy Center or something.Take it and buy bitcoin. Pay for a libertarian's campaign. Buy a gun.Money is power. Take that power away from the government.  Take as much money from the government as you can. Especially if you are going to use it toward giving them less control (such as buying bitcoin). I think now is the most important time to get all of your money off of the exchanges.Not just because with people restricted from going to work, some exchanges may have a harder time running their business.But with people not paying their mortgages, the derivatives market is going to collapse taking down banks at scales far beyond 2008 destroying many of the big banks without much ammo to save them this time. If the bank that is servicing your exchange goes down...what are the odds that the exchange will feel obligated to give you your money? I saw that. I was certainly jealous of the outcome. Wish the same had happened in Thailand to their navy ship.And our engineer keeps thinking myself and the architect are crazy for designing such thick walls that "can stop bullets" in the new model. You guys remember when BCH used to mine blocks? This is what I say every day that I wake up not on a seastead. The best way to figure out if it was true or not would be to find the amount of people with respiratory problems in 2020 who were diagnosed with coronavirus (the common cold).If that number suddenly dropped to near zero since they started testing for COVID-19, then you have your answer. They are showing positive anyone who has any coronavirus, not just COVID-19.I have not been able to track down that number for 2020 though, only the past data showing 20% of people with respiratory problems testing positive.While at the same time, 13.5% of Americans with respiratory problems tested positive for COVID-19.
So many people told me my seastead was not really a seastead because I was not fully self-sufficient (food, water, energy, microprocessors, etc).I always wondered if that meant countries were not real countries because they were not fully self sufficient. Better turn off any bluetooth device you own. They area almost the same frequency (2.4,2.5GHz). Install the Brave browser. It filters out ads at the browser level. Remember this when they test you.  I'm not saying that there isn't a COVID-19 test, but I would not be surprised if they many places are just testing for coronavirus.The media has even stopped referring to it as COVID-19 and are using the term "coronavirus disease". Is this just to cover their ass? They're including people with a common cold in the results. Which are typically 20% positive.https://www.globalresearch.ca/manufactured-pandemic-testing-people-any-strain-coronavirus-not-specifically-covid-19/5707781https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352718300010?via%3Dihub#bb0035"All of the coronavirus tests being used by public health agencies and private labs around the world start with a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-testing-diagnostic-covid19-united-statesAccording to the numbers on this article: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/26/us/coronavirus-testing-states.htmlthe rate of infection of those tested is 13.5%Well below the normal 20% rate that people typically have of coronavirus.They let those test numbers slip, nowhere else do they ever show the rate of infection.

Only the "rising numbers" (as they test more people).13.5% of people tested have a cold. And when they die of a head injury, they do a quick PCR test on their blood. If they find the coronavirus. "They died a Coronavirus related death". Adapt or die. Non gun culture here too. That doesn't help when someone's breaking into your home. The key for me here in Panama is not if I will run out of food, but that the many poor people nearby will run out of food. Then they will go searching. They already rioted in one town and cleared out a local grocery store. My friend was told at his building for everyone to park their cars in the parking garage at his building because thieves are breaking into cars.Fortunately I was preparing for Thai hitmen to come so I am prepared. I may have to change my sleep schedule though. Good one Take this story for example:https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-teenager-death-california-health-insurance-care-emergency-room-covid-19-a9429946.html"Coronavirus: Teenage boy whose death was linked to COVID-19 turned away from urgent care for not having insurance"First of all...the mayor is doing an interview in front of a FEMA camp talking about this poor kid who died.The kid went to a local private clinic, he didn't have insurance for the clinic so he was sent to the government hospital.He had a heart attack (not a COVID-19 symptom) on the way to the hospital. The government hospital had him alive 6 hours before he died in the government hospital.The article is filled with "implying" that he died from Corona virus. "The teens death comes amid a wave of reports about young victims suffering deadly symptoms from Covid-19"Even though he didn't die of it. "Los Angeles County Department of Public Health later said the teens death was taken off a list of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the area."Here they are trying to imply that healthy young people are dying from the virus, dancing around actually pointing to any evidence:"Another New York-area nurse said: What I really want the public to know is that the old and sick are not the only ones who are getting severely ill and dying from this virus. Both of my patients I took care of over the weekend were in their 30s. Both with no known past medical history."....and? Recovered? You had young patients? then what?!?Such bullshit. They are culpable in the destroying lives around the world.What is my solution? No, not to censor. I don't suggest we outlaw the dollar when I advocate the far superior Bitcoin. I don't advocate we ban taxis when supporting Uber. I don't support banning current news sources but we need something to replace this centralized shit. Things like twitter and social media are helping. You can get tweets from people actually in the New York hospital tweeting about the fact that they're changing the death certificates of people who died of pneumonia or bronchitis to Corona virus.We need a way to award people revealing factual, relevant truth to the world. Right now, only hype and sensationalism is rewarded with views and ad revenue. The media manipulation throughout this whole thing has been ridiculous. What ever happened to "you can't shout 'fire' in a crowded theater"?What will be the way forward to stop this crap? How do we decentralize the media and encourage truth instead of hype? I give this thing another week.Italy numbers found to be fraudulent:"anyone who dies is tested, and if coronavirus is present, the person is counted as a CORONAVIRUS DEATH, even if they died from cancer, or a head injury, or seasonal H1N1 flu."https://www.barnhardt.biz/2020/03/24/wait-just-a-damn-minute-italian-figures-are-with-not-from-coronacold-19/?fbclid=IwAR05pzTAGfVEkg25tHDKyRDtCfhYgj9_EyCfiyQTwGbzkh8PGutoXmKXX-0 I keep hearing that the stimulus package passed but am seeing conflicting reports.Is the digital dollar included? That's what I'm seeing. Just news channels saying "let's check in on a person in the hospital". That indian dude was alone in a hospital with like 20 beds, he said he was there getting tested because he felt sick.When I was in Kuwait the locals told me about the news anchors before the first Iraq war and how they used to have to keep changing their camera angle with the Gulf behind them because the jet skiiers kept interrupting their shot as everyone was going on with their lives in Kuwait as if nothing was happening.I saw firsthand in Thailand how horrible the news is and how it will make shit up.Simple thing to just have a video (like that Indian dude, he said he was super bored...nothing to do, so pop open the cell phone and take video). I'm no conspiracy theorist, I tend to want to see evidence before I even consider anything a possibility, but I tend to be open to see the evidence and make a decision for myself.I believe there is a Corona virus out there. I believe people are getting sick from it. I believe people have died from it.My question:With all of the people that record video of every boring part of their day (planting flowers, eating dinner, walking the dog, etc.), why are there no videos of people in their hospital beds dealing with this virus?A quick search of Youtube shows that there are several media videos of people talking about how they are sick, but no "Joe blow" sitting in his hospital bed talking about how much it sucks on his Youtube channel.And on Facebook I see plenty of people talking about how "my friend's dad died from it" or "my friend is a doctor and he's overwhelmed", etc.But where are the videos? If you know of any, please let me know to ease my confusion. This should be a common thing on Youtube. Yes, this is true. I had 2100 bitcoins in that cryptosteel wallet.When I sue them (and I will), I will expect them to pay me back every satoshi. In bitcoin. We should all be scared. Look at the charts for overall deaths in Europe.  Notice how many deaths there are of people 15-64 since 2020 started. Trying times my friends.You are reading that right. Number of deaths the past few weeks is below the "Normal range". Correct. Seed was on there. They had about 2 weeks to figure out what that piece of paper with a bunch of random words was for.Fortunately I got all of my BTC off of it.
They pulled this part from the bill but showed their hand.Basically every Fed Reserve bank would be a node, everyone has a dollar wallet tied to their identity (either through their bank or verified ID at the post office).Anonymity would be gone. Every transaction traced (though people already do that with their credit cards).The plus side would be the fact that this could allow for decentralized bitcoin exchanges. Convert your bitcoins seamlessly once you get paid in digital dollars. When you go to pay for something, seamlessly convert back to dollars at the point of sale.Until merchants allow for both (since they'll have the hardware for it already). Yes, we know the reason now.You are right. It had absolutely nothing to do with sovereignty. Yep, I went on Amazon a few weeks ago and there were Chloroquine Phosphate pills for sale for about $300 per pack. While Chloroquine Phosphate fish cleaner was about $15 for a full bottle.They gave us that stuff in Iraq/Afghanistan to prevent malaria. Never took it but they're expensive. Ya, perhaps make a song with my private key and sing it every day.But yep, definitely do not trust myself enough to memorize a full private key. I'm feeling a bit nervous about having my bitcoins on the exchange right now. If they suddenly "lose" everyone's bitcoins...what would anyone really care? Everyone has enough problems than to worry about a bunch of rich folks losing money.I am also a bit gun shy on many cold storage systems I have used. I barely got out of Thailand with my bitcoins intact.Keeping anything physical requires thinking of different scenarios. Bugging out I can carry it with me. What if I'm arrested for tyranny reasons and they confiscate my home again? Centralized servers don't seem very secure at this point (encrypting it and putting it on AWS, etc.). There's a brain wallet but many of those were hacked due to humans not being as crafty as they think. I had troubles with my trezor in Thailand, I had the trezor but the backup codes were on the seastead. That's part of it, you need backups but what to do with the backups? I get pretty extreme when doing cold storage for extra security. Last time I bought a cheap computer to create the private keys, then put them into my cryptosteel in an order that only I knew, then I destroyed the computer with a hammer and burned the parts in a fire. Fortunately I had a backup that I split among family members because all of my cryptosteel was on the seastead.Coming up with a new cold storage solution is not simple when you don't trust that your home won't be over-run. If I was thrown in jail I'd like the peace of mind that every day I'm in there I'm getting richer and richer and nobody can steal my bitcoins while I'm in there. My only question is...what are 'essential' sexual activities of 3 or more that are allowed? This reminds me of "The Beach" at Phi Phi island in Thailand where they shut the beach down due to tourists destroying the coral.But they still allowed the park rangers to have access...and likely the ministry of the environment was able to go there with their family and friends for "research" or whichever.They close things off to the pleebs but then they are free to enjoy it as they like. https://jitsi.orgIt's a p2p video conference software. Works very well. CV is making things a little difficult here in Panama but we started preparing for it ahead of time.We pour our concrete floor this Saturday so we will be waiting on that for a month anyway so we can let the workers have their breaks and stay home as Panama is recommending. Not sure if they'll allow the pour though. Should have done it yesterday.I have a video update here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5Mz9bqVhS4Had to send 2 Americans home yesterday before they close the airports tomorrow. Tattoo with the person's SS number and maybe sew a symbol on peoples' clothes. Like a big star to show people that you're a shining star in the darkness. Perfect. Hopefully a nice GUI gets built for this. I wish I had the time to work on it myself, maybe we can integrate it into the Ocean Builders smart home app. Looks like Bitmessage is still going. Their reddit page is active.https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page If things get really bad and they start shutting down centralized messaging services, what are our decentralized options? Just dropped two people off at the airport to head back to the US from Panama. As of Monday all commercial flights will be canceled.Roadblocks everywhere. Yep, I'm flush with bitcoin...but...I need to help fund our business of getting people off of land and safely away from the psychos that believe they control every bit of dirt. I'm glad I only cashed out like $30k worth of BTC last year. It will put me among the poor folks when it comes time for some of that sweet free money they're handing out. Especially now that I'm married.Thanks socialists. I'll put it to good use protecting my own individual freedom. I hope this is true everywhere.They just issued a level 4 Global Level 4 Health Advisory in the US calling all US citizens to return to the US. Does anyone remember the name of the TV show that came out about a decade or so ago where the US is attacked (China?) by something where everyone has to wear a wristband that kills you if you try to take it off or do something bad. In order to get food or leave your home you need to wear it.Also...Hong Kong is making all travelers wear a wristband that helps assure you are self quarantined.What color wristband do you want? This was not news. Minutes from the meeting.I agree, take it with a grain of salt, they will be having more meetings between now and June. Just putting it out there. So I have some information from a meeting of the French government, I have confirmed its authenticity. I'm not into spreading craziness, just putting it out there.They are assuming 30-40% of their population gets affected. They are planning on a peak in June. They believe it is a single event, not seasonal.They do not believe the EU will last another 5 years.The key part is that they believe the economic outcome will be so bad that they will have to enact martial law. The discussion regarding this is that they will need to give special treatment to the families of the military because the threat is internal as opposed to external. So they will be asking soldiers to do bad things to its own citizens and need them to think about the well being of their own families as motivation.Just an FYI, I'm sure governments are having similar discussions. Here in Panama everything is fine where I live since we're so far away from the city. I stocked up for a couple of months and have a fishing pole.
Actually we are working closely with drone companies for drone delivery. As well as drone pick up of garbage and other waste. https://twitter.com/ChrisPacia/status/1237821675728777221Ebay not allowing people to sell masks or hand sanitizer.OpenBazaar users not affected. Americans have very short attention spans so I suspect that this Corona thing will end in a couple of weeks.The longer it lasts the more they will be willing to sacrifice whatever they can to make it just finish already.The media hype will get desperate for attention but likely they will find some new shiny story to focus on. Had a chat with my Chinese supplier last night.Of course, she is getting her government information the same as everyone else. But her factory is up and running shipping our stuff. I have other orders going through now too. China seems to be back on track. I'm sure you are just on the edge of your seat to see our progress in the coming months. As we actually do things instead of talk about them.I'd welcome you down to come see our progress but...not so much. Consider the halving.Some people always throw out the idea that if the miners start getting paid half of their reward then mining will end. Well, the scenario they pose is that enough miners stop mining that the few remaining miners cannot mine a block for weeks.The miners are now getting half of the value they were just last week. Yes, I'm not worried too much. Even if it's a dead cat bounce I know it will come back up. I'd just rather not have to wait yet another year for the price to get back up in the 5 figures.In the meantime I am copyrighting the Vegeta meme and will be making most of my money based off of that. Ok then. Sorry I answered your question. That is about what I expected.Don't worry. Lesson learned. So I guess we have a day or so to find out if we have a dead cat bounce or a double bottom. Either way, the price will likely go down a bit. Excellent, it looks like we all want to talk about toilets on boats.Here are just a few of the options:Composting toiletMarine toiletIncinerating toiletAnaerobic digesterUrine diverting toiletHere is a quick primer for seasteading and the #2 question everyone always asks: Seasteading. Where does the poop go?Composting toiletThis is a very simple solution which can easily be used on a seapod.Here are our friends the Wynns explaining the intricacies of their composting toilet they had on their RV which they then installed in their boat.https://www.gonewiththewynns.com/compost-toilet-big-questionsThe downside to the composting toilet is that the user experience is not seamless. Good for people living there long term but we do not want people coming to visit for vacation learning a new toilet procedure using coconut husk or sawdust.There are certainly a lot of different composting toilets, our storage is a few meters below the toilet so we have the benefit of the waste being far below the toilet which helps with smell.Marine toiletThis is what we had on the first seastead. On that one we chose to use fresh water to flush but on our boats we used salt water. In Thailand all of the boats just flush out to sea so that's what we did as well. Our boat didn't even have a waste tank.Here in Panama we will not be letting anything into the water so we will have a black water tank (even though the current boats in the marina and anchorage do not follow any sort of clean waste procedure). We will have a service for pumping out peoples' black water tanks. Fairly simple, the technology has been around and proven for decades.The upside of these toilets is the user experience is the same as being at home. The downside being the need to pay for a service to come pump out your black water.Incinerating toiletThere are several different types of incinerating toilets, the one we are looking at has the same user experience with a hose that runs down to the incinerator. You just dump the ash every couple of months.We are leaning toward this one.The upside is that the user experience is the same as a marine toilet. There is no need for pumping out the black water and for vacationers the maid can just empty the ash periodically.The downside is the cost and the energy usage. Fortunately here in Panama natural gas is cheap so using a natural gas incinerator may keep the price down for energy usage.Anaerobic digesterSeasteader, Jeff Frusha, just started his company in Texas creating anaerobic digesters which converts poop into biogas. He has been pushing this for years on the seasteading forums. I have been in contact with him and he is open to adapting his design for the space we have on the seapod.Here is an explanation of how to build a bio digester.http://www.solarcities.eu/education/388Urine diverting toiletThough not a type of waste disposal system, this can be used with any of the above systems. It helps to separate the urine from the poop. The key being that the mixing of the urine and poop creates the toxicity while poop alone will break down in hours on its own, urine on its own is fairly sterile. Though you need to factor in the prescription drugs that people take along with caffeine and other things so the waste cannot be used for anything useful unless you know that the people living there are not ingesting chemicals that would harm the plants or other things you may use the compost for.While this is all fascinating stuff, our goal is to have experts in each field focus on these things for us. We will likely buy off the shelf products for our first few models as we use what works as much as possible due to the amount of custom engineering needed for everything else. So our focus is on the incinerating toilet first until we have an expert in toilet technology come down to our incubator to design something specific to our design. There is a $4k incinerating toilet that we will buy for the first model that can hose the waste down into the storage area where the incinerator will sit.We have promised the Panama government that we will not dump any waste into the sea. So, just like almost every other thing here in Panama, we are not following what the locals actually do and we are going above and beyond what most of the world does.The fish do not get the benefits of our waste thanks to peoples' feelings. The US gave out about $1200 after 9/11. To boost the economy. You may want to look up the term 'governance'. Again, you try to mix and match projects (there is this thing called 'time', there is past, present and future...). In Thailand self governance was part of the project because we were more than 12nm out. In Panama our project is not even seasteading because we are in a nation's territorial waters with no special economic zone.Of the few different options of toilets, none of them will cost over $5000. That is easy to factor into the cost.Toilets on a boat are not a new thing. All the people on the project have lived on a boat at some point. Not sure what your obsession is about toilets. We are looking mainly at an incinerating toilet but also exploring the option of composting or just marine toilets with tanks. The priority being that it needs to be convenient for the user (no learning curve required). We can have a long discussion on toilets and poop and how it breaks down, how long it takes, etc. if you want. Most people are not fans of discussing poop but you seem to be into it.There are much bigger engineering challenges than that though. Adding a toilet is easy, making a home that can withstand 2-3 meter waves is the one we are more focused on "getting right".We are allowing people to reserve their homes with a refundable $100 deposit, there is certainly no deadline. Besides Anarchapulco and our Facebook group we have not really advertised this option. We knew people at Anarchapulco would be interested so we wanted to make sure the option was available. We are building a manufacturing facility, we want to make sure that there is actual demand (and how much demand there is). That will factor in how much money we spend on equipment. Even Tesla asked for a refundable $100 deposit for their truck that they plan on starting to build in 2022.So...where is this money grab you speak of? $100 from a few people? Is that the whole point of our manufacturing facility, contracts with the marina, purchase of a $150k+ 3D printer, several thousand dollars on scale models, permitting, licensing, paying lawyers for forming a business, getting our homes classified as a houseboat for flagging... Source? Yep. 3 different projects run by many different people. All one long combined project. I am the only person in the world interested in seasteading so obviously I am running it all. I'll be sure to tell the other projects in St. Lucia and San Francisco that they need to start answering to me because those are my projects too.Here in Panama we are currently in the testing phase. We order samples of what we want to put into the home and try it out to see if it makes sense for the home. To make a final statement of how the bathroom is going to be set up without testing is premature. Even on the first seastead after I talked about composting toilets, urine diverting toilets, etc. the engineer (the guy funding it all, who makes the decisions) told the manufacturer to just let it go into the water since we were 13nm out.We can give estimates of prices at this point because we have already built the prototype and know the costs of that one. We can safely say that we can build a base model for $195,000. This is based on what we are currently paying for labor, what we paid for the 1/3 scale models, what we are paying for material, etc. We know that we have wiggle room of going from the most basic home with tanks to take care of water and waste and a generator for electricity to the more advanced features of solar, batteries, water maker, incinerating toilet, etc. The price stays the same but how much we can offer for that price can be changed. It will still be a floating home on the water. We can add optional add-ons as needed.We are not looking for investors. We are funding it all ourselves. No need for shark tank. Our engineer would not accept investors anyway. We have had to turn people away who want to invest in the business. We are building so we're not really worried about marketing. We have enough work for the next year. We assume that after people see these in the water and can walk on them they will want to buy one or a share of one.Even the first seastead I never talked about it until it was in the water. But at this point a lot of people want to be kept up to date on what we're doing so I let people know. We are not worried about publicity. Are we giving these homes away? No. I'm not sure what world you live in where asking people to pay for something is some sort of scam. These will not be charity homes. People will need to pay for them. We started asking for a refundable $100 deposit because we had several hundred people telling us that they wanted to buy one but unless they actually have to put a small amount of money behind that we cannot gauge the interest. Having a price we can build to that price, it gives us constraints on the level of technology we put into it. It lets everyone in the design line know that we're not building $1 million homes so leave that experimental 30% efficiency solar paint that is being designed in the lab behind and focus on the 50 cents per watt solar cells from Alibaba. Leave the untested water-from-air prototype for someone else as we buy a $5,000 desalinator on Amazon. We had an estimate of $70k for that big window shown in the pictures so we are coming up with better solutions.You say I'm all about the money but this tends to be the number one question we get. How much will it cost?This is something no other seasteading project ever likes to answer. I'm going to be up front about it. Putting a price allows us to get past all of the dreamers of "I'm going to quit my job and go live on a seastead!" to let them know that they'll actually have to pay for their home. It allows for people who actually want to come down here to begin planning. Because this project is actually building something.$10,000 for a one week per year share gives an upper bound of $500k for a fully upgraded home with all the bells and whistles. We will likely leave the share management to third party companies but we are already getting people reserving those, so obviously people want it. A group could get together and buy a basic home for $195k and have 2.5 weeks each year. One of our buyers plans on buying one and tokenizing ownership (he's actually coming down to the build site this weekend to check things out). Our focus is on building these and selling them. What people do with them after that we're happy to assist but can't guess at this point all of the different things that will be done after purchase. Time number 500 where Franky takes my words from another project and applies it to another project. Your quote was from when I was talking about the Marinea project. You also try to act like I am the only one on all of these projects making all of the decisions. I wish I had been in charge of these projects, things would have turned out a lot differently. Even here in Panama I am the Chief Operations Officer of Ocean Builders. There is a CEO and above him is the guy with the money that actually runs the company (who has been running it all along) https://ocean.builders/about .As for how the water, waste, toilets, etc. work. I can always postulate on the final solution (compost, anaerobic digester, incineration, black water disposal, urine diverting toilet, etc.) but it's not until it's actually implemented that it matters. As for water, that's a simple solution that we used in Thailand and many ships have used for decades (desalinator). Of course, the decision was never mine to make so I could only pose possible solutions. The final solution for waste was to let it go into the ocean and feed the fish below. Garbage was easy enough...just take it back into town whenever we were heading in (just like boats do). The key being to try not to bring a lot of garbage out in the first place (get rid of plastic before coming out, leave the packaging on the boat, etc.). We never planned on being fully self sufficient. People don't get that through their heads and still don't get it. I don't know how many ways someone has to say it but you do not have to be fully self sufficient (especially on the prototype model). I think my analogy gets lost when I say "we're not building our own chips for computers on the seastead", but unfortunately I even had someone saying that we should be doing that and make sure we deal with the heavy metals or whichever that we'd be using. Seriously. No nation in the world is even fully self sufficient so why would it be expected that a single home can provide every solution to everything? How many rice patties does Singapore have? Enough to feed all of their people?As for Franky thinking I don't answer the question. When my answers are manipulated and twisted, it is better to not answer your questions. I am making a mistake by even posting this because now you will look at something I said back in 2009 about wanting to get Ron Paul elected and talk about how much I love Trump because Ron Paul was a Republican running for president and Trump is a Republican running for president so it is all the same thing.Even after my full explanation of the past 3 DIFFERENT projects I VOLUNTEERED on you still believe it is all one project and that I was running all of them. I also promote Bitcoin and answer questions about Bitcoin. Am I Satoshi? Italy suspending all mortgage payments.https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/486760-italy-suspends-mortgage-payments-during-coronavirus Just file with paper this year.Nobody at the IRS will want to open these potential Corona virus letters. You know...the plastic bag ban is only against the grocery stores...You can bring your own.https://www.amazon.com/TashiBox-Thank-Bags-Reusable-Grocery/dp/B01GNWA6JI/ref=sr_1_24?keywords=plastic+bags+roll&qid=1583862691&sr=8-24 People keep telling me the halving is priced in.But obviously the miners are living paycheck to paycheck like the rest of the world. They sell as soon as they get bitcoin.People can pay wholesale prices for bitcoin right now.At the halving, that wholesale cost will be the same but the miners reward will be cut in half.One article I read said that 25% of all bitcoins sent to the exchanges are from miners to sell. That amount will soon be cut to 12%. A lot less people selling on a regular basis. I've been to one of these casinos in Florida. I got on a ferry that took us 12 miles out to a casino boat. We sat out there gambling all day then came back on the ferry.I have no idea how they pay taxes or if they do at all.The thing US seasteaders do not understand is that by living in international waters they are subject to paying US income taxes as if they are in the US. People who live outside of the US get the Foreign Earned Income tax credit which makes it so that their first $100k of income is tax free if they live in another country.But if you are in international waters you are not in a foreign country. So the default goes back to paying full US income taxes.This has been demonstrated in court cases, one man on a contract in the Antarctic tried to claim the Foreign tax credit. He was turned down due to not being in a foreign country.So the whole idea of seasteading being a tax haven is false. You must pay more taxes (as Americans).
Timmy the Timid will likely go to the hospital if he has a little cough thinking he has the Corona virus. Turns out he didn't, but by going to the hospital now he does. My initial theory about this was that the fact that China is communist, and communists being communists a mass killing was due. Communists try to make everyone as equal as the weakest among them.The more weak people there are, the more it hurts the rest of the population. Solution? Create a virus that kills the weak (wipe out the elderly so you can stop taking care of them).Congratulations, you're old enough to stop being productive...now die.Communism is the worst system for protecting the weak. Update on our shipments from China. I had 2 I was waiting for. One is ready to ship, they sent me a video of the crane being tested which also showed a lot of workers there working (all with masks).The other one should ship in a couple of weeks.I put in an order of some steel plates and there is no talk of delays.Hopefully things are going back to normal.I expect this all to fizzle out in a couple of months. Posted this on Farcebook:To my future 2021 friends that will be asking me how to make money with "crypto" as the bitcoin price shoots up.The price is currently under $7700/BTC. This is when you should have been buying if you wanted to "make money".The real answer though is that bitcoin is money. You should not be buying to get more fiat(government money, dollars, etc.) you should be converting your old currency to your new currency that can't be confiscated by governments, frozen by banks, stopped from giving or receiving, and is backed by math not war. If governments were using Bitcoin they wouldn't need to prop up their currency with more math.The halving is 2 months away. The price has shot up after every halving over the course of a year. While the next 2 months will likely be very volatile, it will go up after the halving. People buying now are not "lucky". They are informed.*posting for posterity* This whole thing where bitcoin price is following the stock market tells us one thing.We need to shift the focus of Bitcoin from market and price to utility and actually using it as a currency. Every ETF, every BitPay obstacle they create for paying with bitcoin (while encouraging you to use shitcoins instead), every regulation that makes people prove their entire history of life before they can spend their bitcoins, every ATM shut down by stupid crypto agencies takes us away from that.Bitcoin should be what people are running to right now. They should be dumping their useless government backed stocks, commodities, fiat, etc. and begging for Bitcoin to save them from the government tyranny that is about to wipe out their worth.People should be going on OpenBazaar right now ordering 100 rolls of black market toilet paper and hand sanitizer with confidence that the seller has a 100% rating for his righteous bud. Using Bitcoin. Shops should be confident that their solar powered Bitcoin payment app will connect to the lightning funded mesh network with no interference.

So Amazon won't be docking pay for any warehouse worker that doesn't go to work this month.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/amazon-adjusts-attendance-policy-for-warehouse-workers-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.htmlThere goes US shipping.If you're an employee and your boss says you don't have to come to work...how likely are you to come in? Trump may still have the trader mentality and he sees this huge dip as a buying opportunity.He also believes there needs to be money pumped into the economy to get things on track...So...print money and buy cheap stock...he likely believes the virus is all hype so he believes the markets will bounce back (especially after pouring a bunch of printed money into the economy).Result...billions in gains for the US government. Game over for Democrats.In his mind at least.Reality...he is trying to fight a bubble that popped. One thing to think about with the numbers of infected/recovered vs deaths..I spent about 7 years doing modeling and simulations of military radio networks. We would have fake traffic passing through the network and at the end check to see the throughput.We did a few simulations that had a short time period because it was simulating a full division battle. The results were very poor. A huge percentage of messages did not finish sending. The government would not accept such poor numbers so we were scrambling trying to figure out such low performance.As I started combing through the failed messages I started seeing a pattern. Nothing was really blocking them, it was just that the simulation was cut off soon after they were sent (Like sending a message at 9:59 and the simulation ends at 10:00.So I stopped all transmissions at the previous end of simulation and continued until about double the time. The throughput shot up to close to 99% (the government was satisfied with our numbers and funding continued).There may be 1000 people infected, but the recovery takes 2-4 weeks for most people (from the time they start to show symptoms). This means that it will take about 4 weeks for those 1000 people to register as "recovered", in the mean time many more people are infected. The numbers are always shifting. Both the deaths and the number of recoveries. You need to look at the infected numbers of weeks ago and compare those to the current death and recovery numbers to get the accuracy. Thailand may be bass ackwards but at least they have the toilet thing figured out. About 50 million people die on average per year worldwide.It is safe to assume that Corona virus will just hasten that date for many people who would have died anyway due to their body aging or growing weaker.The rest, car accidents, etc. will continue to happen as well. Looking forward to this being a statement about bitcoin price. The long awaited collapse looks inevitable. The FED will pull out their last tools in the box but after that they'll need to use their guns. This is a post-math society. Everyone gets big money. Because the feels. My wife's mother (in Thailand) is sick. She has no idea if it's Corona. We just read that in Thailand they are giving everyone 2000 Baht (about $80) to try to get people out shopping and get the economy going.Maybe the Thai Navy will see the virus as a threat to national sovereignty and threaten it with death. Speaking of the Internet and how shitty it's become with FBIbook, Twitter, Youtube, etc.  I started playing around with LBRY which is on the way to replacing Youtube.https://lbry.tvThey are getting closer and closer to being as user friendly as Youtube but it is completely decentralized. They use a blockchain backend to track bittorrent files. The more people that use the desktop version, the faster the download speed.LBRY makes money when you upload your files or videos. I uploaded one for .1 LBRY which is about a tenth of a cent. You get LBRY from watching videos and such. Not a whole lot. You can pay for premium videos with your LBRY credits.I've tried to move over to blockchain based social media. I tried MINDS for a while as a replacement for Facebook but getting friends and family over to a new platform will be a long process.Pairing blockchain and bittorrent has a lot of potential. I look forward to playing around with those features. If Bloomberg bought bitcoin instead of spending money on his campaign he could have given everyone in the world 21 million bitcoins. Gen X knows Jeff Bridges as the star man.  We made it out. I took some video while on the run.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OovkeOuZsqU Nah, my family tends to treat everything naturally. Most family members die around 100. Medical doctors are for when you're ready to die. Or you're in an accident.I've never had an aspirin in my life.Hospitals are not as sterile as they would have you believe. Go there if you want to catch Coronavirus.
If you're not on the verge of death, there's no need to go to a hospital.Fix a broken bone or whatever...Most of the time going to the hospital is worse for you than staying home and taking care of yourself. DNC Will Raise Debate Threshold After Tulsi Gabbard Earns a Delegate I never claimed that I built/designed/funded the first seastead. I'll wait while you provide proof to the contrary.There is a world outside of Bitcointalk. I seem to be the only seasteader on this forum but there are a lot of people involved in the different projects going on. And our project is certainly not the only one. Somehow you believe I am the only person controlling all projects and speak for all seasteaders. Big praise but I am not worthy of such a high regard.I wonder how much you hounded the first guy to test drive a Tesla, telling him he hadn't thought about driving distance or where to charge his battery. So, in practical terms, if this virus turns out to be fairly bad and continue at its current pace or worse...what do you think the practical implications will be?More elderly people die earlier...so perhaps this gives a slight boost to the future economy as the costs of society caring for them goes down.If China truly is severely affected at the factory level, we all may be stuck with our current computers/appliances/etc. and need to make sure we take care of our stuff since it may be difficult to get things for a while.Our company is looking to other countries for our supplies...India or Vietnam. Any ideas on the best source for steel and fiberglass?Paper fiat may face its death. We made Grant our CEO a few weeks ago. The plan is to transition things to him as the face of the company for things moving forward in Panama. I am certainly happy to be out of the spotlight. I was more protecting our engineer from the spotlight as he is socially...well, he's a great engineer.If you want to create your own business and believe you can do it better then great! We are open sourcing our design, we want these in the water. All of us involved just want to live on the ocean so if someone else does it better then that makes our lives easier. I am retired so this is just my passion project.I would hope that other companies would sprout up creating great homes on the ocean but having been involved in seasteading for a dozen years now I know that it is mainly people just talking on the Internet and nobody actually doing anything. So until that time, we will be the ones actually doing anything while the arm chair quarterbacks sit back and talk about what we should have done while they don't do anything at all. I can't think of any canned food that I would eat. I saw some canned ham at the store...as I was holding it contemplating if things would get so bad as to need to eat ham from a can...I figured I'd rather go catch some fresh fish than have to resort to such savagery. I live about 2.5 hours from the closest "Costco" type of store. We usually get supplies for a few weeks at a time when we are there so this time we just got a bit extra just in case.The thoughts being that if things start getting bad people will flood the grocery stores. There is not much food grown in Panama so it is almost all imported (strangely enough, people always poo pooed the fact that our small 6 meter wide seastead did not produce all of the food we need while full nations do not produce food). If they are importing it from places that get locked down or whichever, then food supply runs low.Fortunately there is fruit growing on the trees and we bought fishing supplies. So we bought food that goes well with fish and fruit. If things get really bad we jump on a sailboat and go to the ocean.Speaking of...the next video in "The First Seasteaders" series is out.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OovkeOuZsqU I was poor enough to get government cheese in the 80s. Apparently they paid farmers to farm cheese but had too much of it so they gave it out to the poor.https://www.history.com/news/government-cheese-dairy-farmers-reagan If that is a bookshelf full of hand lotion then it is ideal for a good many people. The lead up to the halving is usually volatile. The price will drop again once any major publication posts the theory that at halving the miners will all stop mining (along with the implications of what happens to Bitcoin then).Just enough people will be worried enough to sell bringing the price down yet again.The lower the better to launch the price rise at halving, when mining continues at its normal pace.This time around I am not sure how this Corona virus will affect the price. It may turn into a hedge, the Fed will certainly pump as much as they can which helps.The US is finally getting cases of people affected. China started in November and by January there was full panic. US having first deaths in March could mean full panic mode in May just as the halving happens. If the mining panic drives the price down, people may not see it as a safe haven during the crisis.It could either be a perfect storm for a big bitcoin price or the timing counters sentiment such that it is just a normal rise starting at halving. I certainly went out and stocked up on enough food for about a month. Fortunately I am far from Panama City and there are no reported cases here yet. Here is the latest video in the series: "The First Seasteaders"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OovkeOuZsqU Ocean Builders' engineer, Rudiger, bought it with his own funds. He is a big bitcoin holder.As the bitcoin price rises, our project will thrive with it. Ocean Builders is getting an Erectorbot 3D printer.

People fell for this fake tweet back in 2018 too.https://www.businessinsider.com/fake-trump-tweet-about-stock-market-dow-jones-2018-2?op=1 Do not fear the coronavirus.Prepare for the government exploitation/reaction to the hysteria.   They knew it was a lot of bitcoins they had control of. They joked at times that they were together (rare) that maybe they should put the keys together and be rich. If at any time I felt worried I could move my coins. They put them in safety deposit boxes.Ya, that was another portion of my coins. I had my backup passphrase on the seastead. I had the trezor with me.Fleeing the navy on a sailboat under threat of death while also believing I may have just lost a few hundred k worth of bitcoins was beyond stressful.Protecting your keys is no joke. Most people don't figure "what happens if the government comes and steals my house". Before my flight from Thailand I had most of my bitcoins on cryptosteel wallets evenly distributed which I carried around all over the world (letters and numbers scrambled in a way that only I knew).I also created a printed copy, 2 halves of each private key.I gave them to two of my non-crypto family members that I knew could keep them safe. I told them if I die to combine the papers. They didn't really know what that meant but were fine with locking them away safely for me.After I made it safely to Panama after Thailand took my house (along with my cryptosteel), I got on a video chat with each of my two family members and had them read off the numbers so I could combine them and secure my bitcoins.That was my dead man's switch.Sure, in theory, my family members could have combined the papers and took all of my money...but I trust them with my life so I was not worried about that. Earth by decree?No king is going to tell me that this is Earth!
All of my factory orders in China have told me that they went back to work this week.  The dude proved it in his death. If the Earth was round, he would have launched into space and would now be dead floating in space.Instead he bounced off of the (giant ceiling?) and plummeted back to his death.QED The generator was necessary for running the water pumps that we used to pump the water out of the spar after lowering it to put the platform on top. We used it for some welding as well and decided to keep it there as a backup generator.You like to mix the 3 different projects I've been involved in to somehow be one project. I worked with a couple of guys about 6 years ago on a project called Marinea. The plan for that was initially to build a large concrete seastead in the Bahamas, we spent about a year planning the design and working on things like "how do we get water, Internet, electricity, food, waste disposal, etc."...typical stuff you discuss when talking about seasteading. We sent letters to some people in government of the Bahamas (by "we", I don't mean we all sat there writing a document). The architect and construction guy had a disagreement with the marketing guy who was in charge so the marketing guy shifted focus to buying a floating hotel that he had been researching for years (he sent his brother down to Florida to inspect it, I saw it once as I drove by but never got on it). With all of the SEC laws that prevent people from raising money, the strategy for raising funds to buy the boat was through some sort of membership deal. Pay $100 for membership and you get some sort of benefits at the hotel (free night, etc.). The marketing guy had big dreams that we'd get tens of thousands of people joining up. Once we were ready to move forward on it I posted a couple of times about the idea (which Franky immediately attacked). I was the only one in that project that actually put money into it. I did not have a huge amount of money but I put $10k toward the project so we could get the website going and pay for things like establishing a company, opening a bank account, paying for some professional renderings of our final design, etc. They only had about 5 people buy membership which were all refunded after we realized we would not raise the $10 million or so needed to make things work.Marinea is still trying to exist but it's just one guy and his wife with the dream of buying that floating hotel.Taking the lessons learned from that experience I moved on to the more prominent project from the Seasteading Institute of Blue Frontiers. I flew to Tahiti to meet everyone involved at their conference. There were about 100 people at the conference and there was a great energy of people wanting to make this happen. So I jumped into that project as a volunteer focusing on blockchain solutions for the seastead. With all of the very intelligent people involved and the Memorandum of Understanding with French Polynesia I was confident that this project would actually happen after 10 years of seastead talk. Fortunately at that time the bitcoin price was going up to $20k and I no longer needed to work at my day job and I was able to retire thanks to bitcoin. I did invest about a quarter million into Blue Frontiers but was only one of several major investors. My role in that company was as a volunteer because I wanted it to work out and put my money where my mouth was. They spent about 10 months working on the funding strategy working with lawyers and ICO companies, they had a call with Vitalik, they were spending a lot of money so they had a lot of high profile individuals involved trying to figure out the whole situation of building in French Polynesia while trying to raise money from every nation in the world, including the US and its draconian laws. Their final solution was a token called Varyon which would be a token used as payment for anything related to Blue Frontiers (an Ethererum smart contract), Blue Frontiers would be in charge of the sea zone so this would allow them to charge for use of the sea zone. I promoted Varyon as much as I could as one of hundreds of people promoting it (everyone else was getting paid to do so, I did it out of passion for the project).The ICO went live as bitcoin was crashing and the ICO bubble had popped. Part of the smart contract included a signed contract that refunded all of the money if they did not reach X number of varyon purchased. They raised almost a million dollars but fell short of the goal by about $50k (not many people knew about the refund until it was too late). All of the money was refunded (except us initial investors who were left with nothing).Blue Frontiers still has the occasional meeting and I believe they are still trying to find a country that will give them a sea zone, but they are likely out of money by now.As I was wrapping things up with Blue Frontiers I met this german aeronautical engineer in Bangok (Rudiger). He had already begun working on his floating platform and explained that his ultimate goal is to build a launch loop for launching payloads into space. I left Tahiti and went to see what he was working on in Thailand. He had the spar and platform being built by two separate companies. The spar was being built by a steel company that was used to building large pontoons for gold mining rigs. The platform was being built by a french boat builder who specialized in large party catamarans.I arrived in Thailand and stayed on Rudiger's yacht as we discussed seasteading and the idea that if he wants to build a launch loop in middle of the ocean he'll need a full city of floating homes for the workers as well as supporting businesses and structures, etc. He liked that he would be able to go back to his home town and work on his superconductors while my girlfriend and I stayed on the seastead (which was initially meant just as a watch tower for his launch prototype). He thought it would be a good idea to replicate these things and sell them. His goal not being to make any money off of them (he's Vladmir club wealthy), but to get things built up so he can have homes for the workers of the launch loop. I volunteered to help, my gf speaks Thai and English so she was useful in translating with the steel workers. We would visit the sites when he was off working on his superconductor experiments and give him status reports. I brought my full SCUBA gear and he had plenty of his own so we would go diving at the site and sailing, I began some biorock experiments because he wanted to build large structures in the water and we felt that biorock was a viable option as the price of solar comes down. He paid for the full build of the platform and spar. I would catch a check here and there as he was letting me stay on his boat but it was Thailand so I was hardly spending any money (fortunately since the bitcoin price had dipped). I put Rudiger in contact with everyone he needed to talk to through my contacts with Ocean Builders and the Seasteading Institute. After having seen so many crypto projects get started promising the world only to never deliver I stressed that we should not advertise the sale of any of our seasteads until we had one in the water. We were excited about the project as it moved forward but kept it under wraps publicly because we did not want to promise something only for the thing to fail and disappoint a lot of people (like with Blue Frontiers). We also didn't want to waste money on advertising and marketing (avoiding all of the failures of Blue Frontiers) and lawyers and endless money pit meetings, etc. We did contact a few lawyers in Thailand and spoke to the harbor master about what we were doing. Each lawyer told us that because what we were doing was 12nm out Thailand had no say in it. The harbor master didn't want to be bothered by it (it didn't fit into any category he knew how to deal with). So our plan was to prove ourselves to Thailand by building the first structure then getting 20 orders to show Thailand that we would be bringing money to their country. We planned on taking a 1% deposit keeping the first 20 homes at or below the cost to build them. We brought out a group of people from Blue Frontiers who were likely customers to show them the launch of the seastead. Unfortunately the biggest storm in 60 years hit on the week we planned to launch so we had to postpone (still not going public). Joe Quirk brought a camera crew for the event and got plenty of good footage for his videos. Once we got it in the water I started posting blogs and contacting friendly independent media (I had been talking to Reason about it for a while and we've been talking to a journalist at Wired who is still working with us). I posted on bitcointalk but of course Franky attacked me talking about Blue Frontiers and Marinea and how we don't know what solar panels are and have no idea that there are off the shelf water makers that our boat manufacturer has been installing on boats for years.That venture left me down about $100k worth of stuff in Thailand (my boat, vehicle, all of my possessions on the seastead, etc.).So now we move forward in Panama. At this point I am more than a volunteer. I am now one of the founders along with our CEO that joined us to move forward on the business side. We are still only taking deposits toward peoples' homes. Refundable $100 deposit which will require 20% deposit when we begin building the customer's actual home (likely to take place this summer). We already have a few people that have reserved their SeaPods. Each of the founders plans on buying one, we have the eco resort guy and we've actually not even started advertising that we are taking deposits yet outside of Anarchapulco and silently updating our website. I have an e-mail list of about 1000 people who have expressed interest on the website that I have not updated yet. We're all still getting back from travel before we begin letting them know. We are busy setting up our factory (the building material just arrived last week). The concrete has been poured for the footings and we pour the floor next week. Our 3D printer has been delayed but we will finally get that in about a month (we've been waiting for that for a while to get moving forward). The coronavirus has delayed our rolling machine and crane for the factory but we're hoping they all get here around the beginning of April (hopefully the factory is finished by then).Ocean Builders' ultimate goal is a space launch, it always has been. That's why in Thailand I knew that when they were charging us with trying to create a new nation they would not find any evidence of it because that was never the goal. Sure, as a libertarian I am in it for the ability to live somewhere away from territorial law, but as I have stated many times, a seastead nation makes about as much sense as a bitcoin bank. It seems people who supposedly understand Bitcoin don't even grasp that concept.We're moving forward, all with our own money. We don't actually need investors and Rudiger does not want any (until he's built his small scale launch loop prototype). We've spent around half a million of our own money so far moving this project forward in Panama. Workers are happy, Panama is happy, we are going to make sure our customers get the most awesome homes they've ever seen. If the bitcoin price hits $40k or higher...this project is going to be crazy funded (we are all bitcoin hodlers).Not sure what to tell ya, we're going to make it happen. You'll just have to sit back and witness history being made from behind your computer screen. Again...source?You literally just posted a picture of the solar panels on top of the seastead (which ran our water maker which you keep going on and on about).6 240 Watt panels connected to 6 12V marine batteries, plenty of energy for our refrigerator, lights, water pump, water maker and wall sockets for charging our phones, laptops, repeater (for 22Mbps Internet) and marine radios.But you do not listen so I am going back to ignoring you and your "you (and the many people working on this project) aren't thinking about "<insert things we're constantly thinking about here>" due to not explaining every little thing to me online (even though I have no intention of ever supporting the project and will only ignore or twist anything you say and make up my own BS to fit my narrative). This. My suppliers are telling me the factories are all shut down and they will get back to me when they can get back to work. Last contact was last week. We have a lot of pictures and video but not much on the web yet.You can see it in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzFxKUxx9nEWe only did the 1/3rd scale of the spar to test the stability. We will build a scale of the pod portion in the next few weeks when we get the 3D printer installed. source of your all too common statement? Yep, Franky is absolutely correct. What we are building in Panama are house boats. We are not claiming any micronations, no sovereignty other than what any other boater gets to enjoy.I am fully hopeful that other companies get out and start building because we would all rather be living on these things rather than building them ourselves but nobody is doing so. I grew tired of the megasuperstructure seasteads that required hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. I kept screaming to the Blue Frontiers people to "just build something already!". So when I met the aeronautical engineer, Rudiger Koch, down in Thailand who had already begun building I was all on board and was happy to test drive his prototype by living on it and promoting the concept of building more.I will be the first to say that no seastead should, right now, be fully sustainable. Nor should any house or state or nation. I don't think Hong Kong or Singapore are any less sovereign for not producing their own rice or microprocessors for their computers. I don't think seasteaders should focus on having cattle ranches on the sea.We are building floating homes. We are setting up manufacturing, moving full steam ahead on producing as many of these homes as possible while trying to keep the prices down. We are skipping the early stages that we would have done in Thailand of contracting out the manufacturing to another company (that would gouge us on cost because they could). We are setting up a full manufacturing facility in Panama with an assembly line for getting these things out the door, all within a marina where we can lower them into the water to a well protected location in an anchorage close to the marina.This is certainly not seasteading, I will be the first to say that seasteading requires some sort of sovereignty. We proved we can build homes in the open ocean in Thailand. Now we're working out the manufacturing process while focusing on having a comfortable living experience for our customers.We are not doing any fundraising, creating beautiful pictures of a city that will never exist only to collect millions of dollars while we talk about what we're going to do using that money to try to get more millions. We're using our own money to build these SeaPods. We won't collect any money until after our first one is built and people can come down and walk around in it and try it out for themselves. Our goal is building these homes with one or two per month, so if anyone puts down their 20% deposit, they should be able to move in within a month. Ocean Builders is currently taking $100 refundable deposits for people to indicate their interest and reserve their place in line. Previously we just had a check box on our website for people to indicate their willingness to buy (so we could gauge interest on whether to move forward with building a manufacturing site), while we had over 200 people indicate that they wanted to buy one, we decided to put in the refundable deposit option (following Tesla's example as they did with the Cybertruck) so that we could get a better indication of how serious people are about buying.Once we have a community living on the water, we will be working with them on future plans. We already have a 1/3rd scale prototype for the open ocean. We are following flagging laws in Panama before putting that prototype in the open sea. We already tested a 1/3 scale prototype for the shallow water version. It's sitting in the marina right now.We will be building LandPods.As we began working on these, Ocean Builders' CEO ran into a wealthy land owner in Panama that had plans to build an eco-resort at his coffee plantation. He had plans for some tree houses but after seeing our design said he wanted our homes instead. So we are working with him to build about 10 of them for his resort. With the center tube only being 1.6m diameter, it's great for putting them on the ground in a place where a normal home would not do well, saving the trees from being cut down to make room for the home while being high enough to look out over the trees or be among the treetops with the parrots, monkeys and sloths. His order is helping us to kick start the build process knowing we have orders and can move forward. The design is almost exactly the same so as we move forward on those orders we can replicate the effort for our floating homes.Whatever happened in Thailand, we proved that you can live on a floating home in middle of the ocean. The genie is out of the bottle on that one. The ocean is the next frontier. Not even the most corrupt navy can take away that fact.  Ordered a crane for the Ocean Builders factory from China.They had previously pushed back the delivery date. At first we figured they were just making excuses. Today they said it will be delayed longer because all factories in their area are shut down due to the virus. Up. aaannnndddd...you just lost about 90% of marijuana users... Thanks, I'll give it a shot. It's not out of stubbornness that I don't also install bitcoind. It requires a whole new server because omni is already running on the same ports and I've already spent the weeks it takes to get the 300G+ of blockchain caught up.I may just go the route of utilizing a third party host for BTCPay until we have enough traffic to justify another server.Just making sure there wasn't some setting I was missing to turn on the port. Iptables had nothing so I added for 8333Code:Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes) pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination          2754  161K ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:8333Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes) pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes) pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destinationMy rpcallowip was set to the host IP address, changed to 127.0.0.1 to see if that changed anything.BTCPay requires running NBXplorer which connects to port 8333Code:fail: Configuration:  BTC: Unhandled in Waiter loopSystem.OperationCanceledException: Loading the chain from the node timed out ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (111): Connection refusedFor netstat it shows no port 8333 open.Code:sudo netstat -tulp | grep LISTENtcp        0      0 localhost:6379          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14879/redis-server  tcp        0      0 localhost:8332          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      27202/./omnicored   tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:http            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      7236/nginx: master  tcp        0      0 localhost:postgresql    0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      7955/postgres       tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:smtp            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      23875/master        tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:https           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      7236/nginx: master  tcp        0      0 localhost:24444         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      826/NBXplorer       tcp        0      0 localhost:1088          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4989/uwsgi               tcp        0      0 localhost:1091          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      5059/python         While there is nowhere that shows that BTCPay and Omni cannot work on the same server, I have seen it suggested that since Omni is essentially running bitcoind you should not need a separate server if you need bitcoind's features.Is there something I am missing as far as "turning on listening for port 8333?" I have seen mentions online that you should turn on 8333 to help the community.  It's over 9000. I used to have the perfect place to wait out this virus.Then the Thai Navy got jealous.  It has intrinsic value but part of that value is that it has the potential to replace currencies. They actually call it a cryptocurrency...so maybe it should be used as one.The trend has not been toward more uses in spending but less. I have to agree with Mark Cuban on this one...if you can't use it other than just speculating on it, then what's the point? Just speculate on any number of other things with limited amounts.My hope has always been that it will replace the dollar. Without the dollar, the US cannot print money out of nowhere to fund its endless wars. I'm running the Omni Layer which is essentially running Bitcoin with some extras.When I start omnicored (same as bitcoind) the logs show:2020-01-17T14:23:15Z AddLocal(167.71.2.197:8333,1)2020-01-17T14:23:15Z Bound to [::]:83332020-01-17T14:23:15Z Bound to 0.0.0.0:8333But a netstat and any other check of listening ports does not show port 8333 open. There are no firewalls set up (running on a Linux server) yet so nothing is blocking it, and I'm just trying to connect from the local host.Any ideas?I'm trying to run BTCPay on the same server and it requires connection to 8333. This frustrates me as my support for Bitcoin is as a currency, not as some sort of replacement for gold to be exchanged and used for long term savings. The plan was to replace fiat...not just exchange value in fiat.I have not seen anything to get my hopes up on this at all. When BitPay turned into BitCashPay we lost a major advance toward using Bitcoin as a currency. I have learned that BTCPay is a great solution for this but most companies just want to sign up for a service and have money deposited in their bank accounts.I have had to move from paying my hosting services in bitcoin to dusting off the old credit card.Years ago I started work on a cheap, simple device to put in a retail store so they can easily accept bitcoin without having any knowledge of bitcoin. Now I feel like if I were to approach a business owner they would start talking to me about "crypto" and shitcoins and get lost in the speculation of it all...finally passing on plugging in my device. Oh well, maybe another ETF to make the price in fiat go higher...yay
With all of this Coronavirus going on the people I feel bad about are the Wutan Clan. Anybody know if they're ok? yes, that would be bad Had not heard of that. I could always use gmail's SMTP server. I would assume that having an SMTP server would get blacklisted if there is a lot of spam coming from that IP. An update on my excursion into the world of Bitcoin's Omni Layer.Omni Layer (previously Mastercoin) is a colored coin implementation of the Bitcoin blockchain. They primarily use the OP_RETURN to broadcast extra data of each transaction.My impression of the project is that they had their hay day back before Ethereum and the whole ICO craze. Since then it has been slow on development with plenty of ideas and promises of great things to come with not much follow through (like all of the ICOs). But it is stable and useful for my purposes. It allows for decentralized exchange of all tokens created using its protocol. There is some lightning implementation but I have not gone down that road yet.I was able to get the wallet and everything up and running on my server. I started downloading the blockchain the first week of January and I am now about a day or so away from everything being caught up. It has to download the Bitcoin blockchain first, then go through the blockchain and parse the transactions to determine if there is any Omni layer data to process, then put that in the database.The whole things works almost out of the box. Very limited instructions so I had to delve into the code to figure things out. Setting up SMTP and SSL were the final steps I needed to get it all working.I'll be speaking at Anarchapulco in a few weeks and Ocean Builders wants people to be able to buy our sea homes easily with bitcoin, even if they only want partial ownership. We pour the concrete for our factory at the local marina this week so after a month or so we begin full scale production. Goldman Sachs is not allowing #nohomohttps://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/goldman-to-refuse-ipos-if-all-directors-are-white-straight-men/ar-BBZgUOP?li=BBnbfcNBefore they will IPO a company, the company must prove that at least on of its board members is a female or gay.They have not yet specified the criteria by which a board member must prove his homosexuality...but I suspect you will start to see board members like this applying for IPOs:So essentially, Goldman Sachs is encouraging straight men to move to Bitcoin. We have a 20x8 foot 3D printer that will be able to print sections down to the millimeter. So we can do some very detailed and unique designs. We are focused on getting the sexy look and feel to it so it should be quite impressive. We (by we, I mean the guy funding it) are ok with taking the monetary risk to throw our success in Panama in Thailand's face.The underwater room is an added feature. We are working to keep the price of the base model affordable (under $200k). One key to the spar design is that the less surface area at the surface the better. This is where the waves are crashing against your seastead. Ideally they would meet a thin pole, 1mm thick holding your house above it.As it is, that would not support any structure so we have opted for a steel tube 1.6m wide. We could make it smaller but we want it to be easy for people to walk down a spiral staircase into the spar so they can reach the underwater room with views like this: They call it the halving because on that date everyone sends me half of their bitcoin.This has lead to the price climbing by 10x every time. Think of it as an investment.If someone fails to send me half of their bitcoins the price will crash to zero. Don't be that guy. So frustrating!I lost all of the gold I have ever owned. My map showing where I buried it was destroyed and somehow when I dug down where I think the gold was it was not there. So now not only is my gold intrinsically worthless; it has no market value either. I knew owning gold was a bad idea, I just never realized it was this bad! I just bought 100,000 of CW's imaginary coins.On the fake exchange in my head.For real gold. Our floating homes will not be high risk. As high risk as buying a houseboat.Paying with bitcoin is not high risk. It is actually easier than trying to pay with dollars.Holding partial ownership on the blockchain...ok, slightly new but not much difference from owning a timeshare. Probably cheaper.It will still require a third party to hold the title as middleman to the Panamanian government. Each home can be sold in different ways, using the Bitcoin blockchain will be one of many options. You can pay with gold for one if you want.I post in here about the different tech around Bitcoin such as Omni (RGB, Rootstock) because there is always talk about it but I have found very few people actually use most of these things so I would rather give a real world perspective on the tech that people read news articles about but don't really know if it is viable. Such things certainly affect the Bitcoin price. If some Bitcoin related tech is hyped, it would be good to know if it is as good as reported. To be fair...he may not know how to do that.Can someone explain that to him so he can prove he's Satoshi? If only there were a way for him to prove that they keys arrived and that he truly is (along with Kleiman) Satoshi.If only... That's it? Everyone worried that a criminal is going to steal your private keys to get your ownership of your house? Then what? Come on a dinghy to your house and tell you that you have to leave because they stole the keys fair and square?You lose $1 million in BTC or a $1 million house...doesn't make holding your keys any different.  Good to see the price coming back. I've been playing around with the Omni Layer and am fairly impressed. It seems like it was all built up for Mastercoin, then changed to Omni later and a lot of work was put into their web wallet...then everyone moved on to something else.But fortunately they left some decent code and I can use it.The plan is to have Ocean Builders credits that are like gift cards toward purchasing a floating home. Then create a new coin for every home built so people can own portions of each home.Omni also provides a decentralized exchange so people can trade via the wallet with no middle man. All running on the Bitcoin blockchain.Though we have a guy who works for Ethereum who is coming to join us who will likely be pushing for it all to be on smart contracts. And since he knows a hell of a lot more about it than I do, he will make a very compelling case.Fortunately all of the owners are big Bitcoin holders so using Bitcoin is an easy sell.Thus begins the battle of the coins for the future of seasteading. Thanks for the update. I made good use of Bitcoin ATMs while on the run.Bitrefill and Bitcoin ATMs...quite useful when fleeing a nation.Unfortunately more and more people will likely need to discover this themselves. I have heard of the Omni Layer before and am looking at it but does anyone have any insight into it?I went to check to see what the most popular use of the OP_RETURN code was on Bitcoin and it appears almost half of them are omni.I am looking at this as a way to record distributed ownership of an Ocean Builders SeaPod. Yep, the idea was that we would be laying low for a while...so why not upgrade the teeth.And cheap here in Panama (see: https://ocean.builders/panama-new-home/ ). Here's my first interview since getting out of Thailand. Talking about Bitcoin and seasteading.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPWqxRAQ7Ts As I worked through the world of engineering and salaries I realized that there was a sort of ceiling as far as wages go. You could hit senior level and there was usually nothing above that.Not being satisfied with just staying under that ceiling (high compared to most careers but a ceiling nonetheless) I went and got my Master's degree in IT management in order to step into that world where there is no ceiling (CEOs are at the top of that salary range and there is no limit there).I hated the idea of being a manager. My master's degree was such a piece of cake compared to my Bachelor's in IT. I eventually discovered that you can get a significant bump to that ceiling by working overseas. The only limit there is how dangerous or shitty a location you're willing to go to but it tended to double or triple that ceiling. I was satisfied with that as an alternative to being management. Fortunately I was able to get out before becoming a manager. Even though, I guess now I am considered management level at Ocean Builders. Fortunately it does not feel like it yet.
Another halving...another idiot proclaiming that at the halving the blocks will not be mined.Even as shitty as the bcash startup was on the fork with blocks hardly ever being mined for the first month or so...the difficulty eventually adjusted and they have their small mining operation keeping things going.See: November 2012 scareSee: July 2016 terror The airdrop is akin to a "gift". The IRS tends to hold the gift giver responsible for paying any tax owed. So if Craig Wright forks Bitcoin in such a way that it initially has value upon being airdropped, he will be liable for tax payments to the IRS of the sum of all bitcoins in existence times the price.Who pays the gift tax? The donor is generally responsible for paying the gift tax.So it's on him to hope that when he gifts the coins, they are worth zero. Upon receipt of any forked coin the forked coin is initially valued at zero. You assume that you have been gifted a zero value token. When you finally sell or exchange that token for something of value you then compare the gifted value (zero) with the value of what you receive upon exchange/sale and you then pay capital gains at that time.It is akin to receiving a baseball card of little to no value as a gift. But then after 10 years that baseball card is now worth $1 million. You must now pay capital gains on $1 million worth of gains. If you hold that baseball card until your dying days, even though it has a lot of value, you would never need to pay any tax on it.  Looks like it. It appears that Maxim Orlovsky is moving forward with it as well as a decentralized file storage solution over LN.If it's possible I am fine with helping to make it happen. I just need to read the specs over and over again until it all clicks. I am still a bit hazy on the details of LN outside of the big picture so I have a lot of work ahead of me. Latest thing I started playing with is Spectrum and RGB...colored coins for the Lightning Network. I have been trying to figure out how this can be done for quite a while, it appears someone has figured it out. So I will be delving deeply into the guts to figure it all out.I am looking at decentralized partial ownership structures for titling seastead homes.While there are shitcoin solutions, they will come and they will go. I would rather have something that is very likely to last at least 100 years like Bitcoin will. It's a US government thing. I know in the military world every company owner is a woman, usually a minority and usually a veteran. When the government awards contracts they are required to have a certain percentage of their contracts to minority groups. It's like you get points for each one. Veteran, female, minority (more points for certain minorities). So what happens is a man wants to create a business so he puts his wife down as the "owner". She sits at home drinking lattes while he's out there building a business.Who knows, maybe some women are starting their own business. But you will never know because of the incentive. Someone accidentally uses CC instead of BCC in their newsletter and now they have "Massive" problems?Some scary shit right there. No Haiku today. Sorry, I just don't have time. I wish I did though. Must be nice to live in a country where you can use bitcoin to pay for things online.The US is stuck with BitPay where you can't pay with bitcoins without installing some obscure wallet and paying BitPay extra fees while they advertise bcash with zero fees. There is also 3 times more hurricane free ocean than all habitable land in the world.We have quite the space to expand.Before space. Price always drops at the end of the month. We just need to survive a few more days of low prices. Please do not let this get out but if there is anything I fear as a capitalist, libertarian, anti government free radical is the possibility of all of the liberals and governments buying all of my bitcoins.I wake up nightly fearing that this may happen. What if they get all of the bitcoin? Then we are all doomed and you all know it. Fiat will win. Game over.Do not let "them" know this dark secret. It would devastate us all and they would walk away the victors. At that point I would surely need to admit that communism is the best and Karl Marx is a genius. So...the "real" Satoshi comes out supporting "blockchain not Bitcoin"...Even though the REAL Satoshi never once mentioned blockchain "a chain of blocks". I turned down an investment opportunity a few days ago involving a new fund Thiel and Andreessen are getting in on...when the price was $7600.This price is making me reconsider. One makes you larger. One makes you small.Not sure which one though....ask Alice. Nice. What magical land do you live in where the government does not take money from you for owning property? While I tend to hodl, I had to sell a few when it peaked over $10k. A 36% jump is bound to have a slight correction even if medium term things will go up.I'm helping to fund a seastead factory so I need a bit of cash for equipment. Been feeling a bit down not being able to put in my share...I refused to sell at such low prices. Green dildo! I too want to see such a video. I imagine it would bring in much more money than a few Dash they were trying to extort from me  (hey dumbasses, the government has been extorting money from me much longer, work a bit harder next time...at least send a Navy). Do they award the Oscar for such videos? It would likely surpass Avatar.The video would consist of me opening the Bitcoin charts and watching the price shoot up. Giving me great pleasure.
You rent/lease real estate from the government.Try not paying your "rent" some time and see if you own it. So they can only invest in something they do not own. A while back I was phished by the other bitcointalk (.to or something like that). It's the only bitcointalk that comes up in google searches.They got my e-mail and password.I received an e-mail (on that e-mail address) saying that they hacked my computer and have my password (they revealed the password I had used on bitcointalk) and said they have all of my information and have video of me "pleasuring myself" (lol). That if I did not send them some DASH they would reveal the video to the world. Also, because they hacked my computer they would know if I read that e-mail. Also they deleted any trace of the malware I "had downloaded".Fortunately I don't re-use passwords and my laptop has a hardware switch to turn off all devices I do not use (such as the camera, microphone, bluetooth, wifi) so I knew instantly that the e-mail was BS. (It is almost as if I am keeping my information from nosy governments...)FYI in case you've been hit by that phishing site in the past.Also, having been through shit like this with governments twice...think about what you would lose today if some government official walked into your house right this very second and confiscated all of your electronics (phone, computers, etc.) and had them in their possession to unlock any password they desired (except the many layers of encryption I had on my computer when the German government took it the first time). You have no preparation and it comes when you least expect it. Protect yourself. The more you live your life with some small bits of freedom, the more of a target you become.I'm just glad I did not follow through with being a gold bug like I was before Bitcoin. I do believe we need to conquer the ocean before we can move to space. Otherwise we need to wait for governments and NIMBYs to "allow" us to go to space.The point of our initial seastead was to create a support community for a space launch facility in the open ocean. The aerospace engineer putting it all together and funding it (with his Vladmir Club level bitcoins) is planning on building a launch loop about 60km wide. From there he can launch things into space repeatedly minutes or seconds apart. The seastead I lived in was not built to be a home, rather an observation tower.He is determined to move forward on this and build a prototype 300m diameter loop in the next year or so as a proof of concept.Also, going to Mars seems to be a government supported thing. Why go through all of the hassle to get to space...only to get stuck on another rock? Alive and well (except this extremely low bitcoin price). Is there anything being done with Colored Coin development anymore? Or did all of the people developing those jump to shitcoins thinking that everyone would rush to their new off chain "solution".Looking to use the Bitcoin blockchain to record property ownership for the new seasteads. We had a water maker on the seastead. It put out 60 liters per day of fresh water. All run on solar. Escape. For those that want to go to an exciting conference:https://www.anarchapulco.com/You may know one of the speakers that will be announced soon.  Yet another person who will justify stealing as ok. I am not looking for solutions to brainwash people. There are too many ignorant people in the world to educate.The solution needs to be in protecting private property from those people. We need to stay one step ahead of them and this should not be a very difficult task because they tend to be unintelligent.Guns, guard dogs, security systems are a start. Bitcoin is great. HOAs provide local security for neighborhoods.But we need more. There should be segregation. Those that support theft should be kept far away from those that want to protect their property.In a seastead community there should be checks on people entering the area to ensure that thieves are not approaching. If a community wants to be a den of thieves then go for it. All the better for identifying people as such. Just stopping in to say the bitcoin price is shit.That is all. Stay away from Thailand.They will try to get your money by giving you a choice between death, life in Thai prison (a fate worse than death) or all of your bitcoin.The lucky get out while they can. This article sums up our whole seastead adventure in Thailand very well.https://reason.com/2019/10/14/how-two-seasteaders-wound-up-marked-for-death/?fbclid=IwAR3-y1qvAGRewCl3ybTbMS076y2uMZfOD76BRbbKnopjDB8ajVxuihRb7xM The key thing here is that we need to produce more humans.Space is quite large and if we want to spread humanity throughout the cosmos we need more than what we have here on Earth right now. We need to come up with pro-population strategies. We need to encourage a lot more sex.For every Ocean Builders home that we create, the coral garden that goes along with it will start soaking up CO2. Coral reefs make up 90% of the world's ecosystems.There is over three times as much hurricane free ocean space than there is habitable land in the world. This means that if we fill the ocean with these coral building homes will be soaking up CO2 at such a high rate that we will need more humans to produce CO2 so that the plants will be able to survive.If you want lower birth rates you want all the plants on the world to die. How dare you! All well and good. The question is not about stopping stealing, stopping communists from stealing, stopping governments from stealing...it is about how to prevent it from happening to you, as an individual.This is bitcointalk afterall...could we not have a blockchain based reputation system to help with this?A thief database like the child predator map? Know the level of thievery in your neighborhood/city/country in order to know how much money you need to spend on securing your property. I'm just glad I sold all of my bitcoin and bought all rights to the Vegeta 9000 meme. Hey gang. I just started buying a bunch of bitcoins a little while ago but as I keep buying I get less bitcoins for the same amount of money.I am not sure why this is.Oh well. Time to buy thousands more at ever decreasing returns. Reading through it shows just how hard it has been for Bitfinex/Tether to maintain a bank account with so many governments and banks getting in their way.I do not know who the Plaintiffs are but I assume they are butthurt bcash and shitcoin holders who are mad that Bitcoin won the split war due to the value rising. "Tethers monopoly power allows it to raise prices and exclude competition within the cryptocurrency market."They provide zero evidence, all circumstantial about correlations between the price going up and the release of Tether, including times that they had difficulty with their banks but they assume that those banks were their only path of getting funds. As someone who lives outside of the US and has to deal with these shitty banks, you figure out ways to move money in non-traditional ways (completely legally). It is more a study in how much KYC/AML laws are shit and everyone needs to just get all of their money into bitcoin already so they don't have to deal with that bullshit. Wow! Space is big!?! I never knew that...thanks for the insight (is it big enough to dispose of nuclear waste after we have used the nuclear energy to power cities for decades?).Great for NASA. We also got Tang out of it. Now it's time for the big boys to actually do something with it.I believe completely in incrementalism so I, of course, understand that we are not building space colonies tomorrow. I do believe we will be building ocean colonies tomorrow (starting next week actually). From ocean colonies we can build a launch loop to start sending infrastructure into space. From there we can start colonizing our solar system. From there we can build technology to move further and further. When we go further and further we will be able to send humans all over the galaxy where there are also resources like there are on Earth. We may run into the problem of not having enough humans to live both on Earth and those that want to be transported to other worlds but hopefully the population grows at a faster rate.Human ingenuity and progress in that whole thing depends wholly on the government getting out of our way. My dealings with the Thai government demonstrate this very thing. They tried to interfere with that roadmap to space colonization before it could even have more than one house floating in the water. Not through NASA nor any public resources. Just private individuals trying to bring progress to the world.But do not worry. Where one government failed, others see opportunity and have expressed the desire to stay out of the way as they see the benefits of being the world's space port.But back to the OP. You are certainly one of those that we need to protect ourselves from. I am ok with your ideology existing as long as I can protect myself and my belongings from people like you. For every thief coming in the night to steal our belongings we can use technology to stop them. For every Navy that comes to take away our property, there are technological advances that can be developed to thwart them. It will just be a technological race and the "public" will be funding your side of the battle until they grow weary of working most of their lives just to fund theft. And that is why you adhere to a flawed system. You have no confidence in human ingenuity and progress.Stop worrying about doling out a Model T to every citizen and start allowing progress to happen unequally.The universe is full of resources, space travel is imminent. All the sooner if people like you get out of the way.But such technological advances cannot happen without greed, and allowing people to keep the fruits of their labor and shoot for a better life than everyone else. That is the breeding ground for progress and will take us beyond the stars.
$42,000Because XLII is the answer.No haiku from me, I can't think of one right now. Well, at least I tried. a. is irrelevant. Nothing in this whole universe can be equal to another thing nor should it be desirable. b. public property should not exist. You would think that with the tragedy of the commons playing itself out over and over and over people would realize that shared resources are just about the worst way to deal with resources.The brainwashing by the public schools can likely be held accountable for the continuance of such a failed system. But of course, you can't blame them for trying to perpetuate their own inadequacy.In a universe full of planets and energy, I think you are wasting time believing that someone can "take everything". Well, you (communists/people who do not respect private property/etc.) fall into the reason for the original question. What do we (as individuals) do about preventing those who do not believe in private property taking our property.I respect that communists think differently and I do not believe that any social structure can exist by requiring everyone to adhere to a specific ideology. Thus the reason why someone who respects private property must be personally responsible for protecting those rights.This, I believe, may come down to upgrading our ways of protecting property via technology (autonomous drones, blockchain reputation system, tracking devices, etc.).No, I do not believe every person should be a bread maker but if you have the unlimited power of a Dyson Sphere you should not be worrying about 10 people remaining and only 10 loaves of bread. Through technology all of the needs (and wants) of individuals can be obtained in this vast universe if only those who value equality over progress would get out of our way and let humanity move forward (each according to his own desires).Once we can individually protect our own private property through more advanced technology (such as being able to hold your private Bitcoin keys in your head), then the state will no longer be able to steal as easily as it currently does. Until there is one Dyson Sphere and a full galaxy for each human in the universe, I don't believe we need to worry about resources per person. And if you still cannot produce a loaf of bread with nearly limitless energy and a full galaxy at your disposal then it is likely best that you not eat anything at all and do a solid for humans as a species. I've been through enough to not let some dude intimidate me.Where's your battleship dude? From what I was told of Singapore, part of their success is due to the stiff punishments they had to put into place on thieves. They essentially accepted a lot of citizens who were thieves and had to completely change the culture to get to the point where they are now. Perhaps it is about severe punishments but they also restrict access very well.I do lean toward personal responsibility, but the very simple act of running into the store to buy groceries while you have anything in the bed of your truck means you have to either bring it with you, have someone guard it or put it inside the truck. Little simple things like needing to chain down your lawn furniture and stuff like that. I was recently the guy guarding the truck while my friends were buying groceries and was approached by 3 different people gauging my level of protection vs what may have been in the truck bed. One guy implying that he would bring some guys with guns if I didn't give him a bit of cash (acting like he was joking the whole time). We are working with a solar company that claims to achieved 70% efficiency. Unfortunately it is not production ready but they may partner with us to showcase their product.It would be truly revolutionary if they can achieve it. It seems to me that the end of the month futures closing has always been met with a big crash. Apparently someone realized this early and sold a few days before the end of the month.I suspect the price will climb back up with yet another crash at the end of the month. Perhaps a day or so earlier than this month.Until BAKKT grows a bit more volume. I asked about the theft culture in one country I was in. They said that because there was such plentiful food growing on trees ("if you are hungry you can pick a breadfruit and feed your family") that people have grown to be scavengers. You go fishing, you pick fruit, you walk along the road and if you see something, you take it. If someone's house is unprotected, you stop by and grab what you want. No big deal.As far as the punishment for theft, there was one factory that decided to have the police set up a check point as the workers were leaving one day and check everyone's car for stolen items from the factory. Every single car had something they had stolen. The police ended up just letting them all go because they could not round them all up.I agree with the high trust and low trust thing. Perhaps this is why many Americans are against open borders, the cultures clash quite a bit in those regards. I believe Stephan Moleneux touches on this as part of the reason for the fall of the Roman empire.I do not believe that the solution is to teach another culture not to steal. I do not believe Communism will work because they require that everyone stops being greedy...I do not think that any system that requires everyone to think the same way is a good system.It does come down to each person to protect their own property. Perhaps automation can clear up much of this. Maybe a combination of a blockchain based reputation system and ways to capture evidence against thieves would allow for exclusion or some sort of automated warning when a known thief is nearby. Someone who has been proven to steal may suddenly have mini drones hovering around him when he enters a store, watching his every move until he leaves. A micro location device embedded in everything. etc.I do not think that having someone protect you from theft is that bad. Most places I have lived in in these places were a place where I had to pass by a security guard to get to my residence. I felt better that they were there.Having bars on your windows is not liberty...that's more like living in your own prison. This was Ron Paul's platform.Not advocating war got him nowhere.  I have been all over the world and have found that there are some cultures that feel that stealing is perfectly fine.The solution to theft in most of the world is to discourage it through shame and punishment. But some parts of the world do not really see it as wrong. There is no point in shaming and while it may be technically against the law, it is not really enforced because it's "not that bad".The thing I notice in these cultures is that every individual takes measures into their own hands to protect their goods and property. They have bars on the windows, razor wire fences, etc. (even the poorest homes are barred up). There is usually someone in the more populated areas when you park your car who watches your car for you (upon receiving payment), etc.Most people in the west do not need to deal with this and are perhaps lucky in living in a place where theft is not as common.But the countries where theft is common, people are better at preventing theft. I can see why someone from one of these countries going to the US would think "they just let you walk into the grocery store and take food off of the shelves by yourself...no guards at the door or anything", "people leave their homes unprotected with just windows that can be broken", "look, a perfectly good car with so many parts for the taking unprotected".I see a few solutions...everyone evolves protection of their own property (either paying for a service or taking measures into your own hands every day of your life). Or it becomes exclusionary based where thieves are not allowed in a certain area and that area restricts newcomers allowing those in the protected area to live without too much worry about their property.I'm not sure which is the better solution. The first solution sucks needing to worry about thieves every day, the second solution makes people soft and sort of prisoners of their location. I worry about the future due to the way we are building our seasteads.The hurricane free zones of the ocean make up 3 times the space as there is habitable land.Each of our seasteads grows a coral ecosystem underneath.Coral reefs harbour the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem globally and directly support over 500 million people worldwide, mostly in poor countries.If we make enough seasteads to cover more than 3 times the habitable space in the world, with the amount of coral that goes along with it...we may start running out of CO2 due to the coral.Solution?We need more humans. Both to live and buy the seasteads, and to create precious CO2 to feed the coral and other plants of the world.How do we create more humans?Sex.Ocean Builders needs to encourage people to have more sex if they are going to live on seasteads.And as the ocean is just the next frontier on the way to colonizing space...we need a lot more humans for the future.So stop worrying about everything you may be concerned with now...and start figuring out how to have more sex.QED   I showed that to the money guy behind the seastead project (who was about to go buy a cargo ship before the Thai navy thing).He responded with just one word.sub want Pearl farm? Quick update. Moving forward on the next phase of building.Here's a sneak peek.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIo6usoRvqoLocation to be announced "soon". 
The plan would be to not worry about fitting into those regulations. The seastead company itself would not be the only one. There would be several companies residing on the seastead that will not need to be regulated but will still need some sort of structure.What I would want to do is create a sort of Bitcoin business software where you configure the software for your own business and now you can get started (accepting bitcoin, payroll, assigning roles, etc.). Just like loading up Wordpress, choosing a template, company name, some pictures and blurbs you now have a company website.The anonymity is not too severe as far as the employer not knowing the employees or the employee never seeing the employer. You can have an anonymous CEO if you incorporate in Belize. I am thinking more in the lines of protecting those that are running the company in the same way you would want to incorporate in Belize to avoid the meddling of certain super powers into your affairs.True, it would need up front money as opposed to going on loans. Which brings in the investors. That part I cannot figure out unless you have an x of y multi sig wallet where y is the amount of shares with x being at least 50/66% of y. Which would need to be changed for each new share holder. That could get complicated very quickly. Which is fine if software is handling everything in the background. But it just needs to make sense and not have holes. This. Other planets do not have Bitcoin.yet... I used to consider this theory when writing code. Give me enough time and enough monkeys and I can code anything...so when my boss asks if some sort of software can be written my answer was always a confident "yes".Then I saw a video where they gave a keyboard connected to a computer to monkeys...and no...monkeys would never do shit with a keyboard. Smack it a bit and just go and play.So my whole career was a lie.  The use case I am thinking for this is an eventual corporation that does not need to follow all of the SEC BS for forming a company and the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to become compliant. Allowing for investors and such but still being able to move forward.Working for various seasteading companies we did not quite fit into the square box of incorporation that other companies can deal with. An international company, not really planning on doing anything in any nation with international investors and employees.The part about someone stealing...I am assuming when they are hired they are hired based on their reputation. They can be anonymous with a good work history that is provable or they can be known. Mainly hired contractors from freelancer websites. The CEO hiring someone over and over and firing them would also receive a bad reputation. The company would be known. And the first week tends to be not very productive anyway so the work they get out of someone would be very minimal, mostly a hassle of training or getting someone set up.I think the multi-sig part comes in mainly when it gets more complicated with investors who are shareholders that have some sort of vote in the board and get dividends. That becomes super complicated but I'm wondering if it is plausible by having the above simple mechanisms in place just expanded tremendously. Same concept just on a Google sized level. Maybe each board member is part of a multi-sig wallet that hires the CEO and sets the incoming cash flow to go through him. Then they can fire the CEO and change that cash flow to someone else. I'm not sure how shareholders and investors would work.  I am trying to think of a way that a company could be set up so that no incorporation is required, any product sold gets filtered to the employees via mechanisms of multi-sig and time locks.So a simple store with a store owner and a single employee would have owner A open a LN channel with employee B when the employee is hired. Employee B makes and sells a widget for bitcoins with a Bitcoin address that goes to A. A then pays B an agreed upon wage.Simple enough. If B tries to sell the widget to a different address he is immediately fired. If A does not pay B then B just quits..        A.         |.         v.          BAdd more.A hires B to make widgets and C to sell them. Same thing. A pays B and C. C sells the widget for an address that goes to A..        A.       | |.       v v.      B  CAll simple so far.A hires D to manage B and C. A creates a LN channel with D. D creates a LN channel with B and C. .        A.         |.        D.       | |.       v v.       B CAt this point, D would need funds to open the channel with B and C right? Not sure how that part would work.My other question comes to board members. Perhaps they control a multi-sig wallet that pays A who then pays various department heads (D), etc. The idea of this whole thing is to make it all trustless and allow each individual in the company to be anonymous, including A. And have it be such that nobody in the chain can just walk away with all of the company's money (except those that own the company). Any fraud would be minimal (a week's pay, or a single product, etc.).Yes, I know you can make ETH tokens or whichever. But nobody buys products in ETH. This would be a company that could be up and running and only accept bitcoin and be up and running without needing to incorporate, open a bank account, etc. I think the "Cryptocurrencies pose a national security issue" should be noted here.The very first article in Thailand that came out about me and the seastead was just a jumbled mess of quoting 3 different news stories about the seastead but they made sure to throw into a random sentence "threat to national security". It made no sense and was counter to the rest of the article but we knew at that point that it was the military telling them to add that in. We knew that they were setting the stage for how the narrative would play out.Our initial response was to try to hit back with our own PR before the narrative was set but the next day a more bold article came out with a clear message of us being a "threat". That's when we bugged out.Fortunately for Bitcoin it does not need to flee a crazed military bent on extortion. But I can see it as setting the stage for a narrative of crypto being dangerous and a threat to America (and thus, the world). Then cue the nationalists who will "save America" from this "threat" without even considering if the threat is real or not. They will follow the narrative due to their "love of country". I've been playing Call of War for a while. I like it because it's a strategy game like Axis and Allies with several multi player games and you can check in a few times a day to update your strategy (you don't have to sit for hours playing to win). It does help to have more time to react more quickly to changes.They take bitcoin for membership which provides a few perks but I have not had to spend money on it yet to win most games I play. So I did a lot of reading into IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) and find it a non-starter.It seems like a good idea, almost like Bittorrent for the entire Internet. You run the program, host files, people needing those files can retrieve them from those closest to them, etc.But the key comes with the motivation to host files. I kept looking for the motivation and kept hitting the wall of "community" and "for the good of all" type of talk. Is this what's being taught to the millenials? Create a project. Tell people it's good for the community........success!Bitcoin has an embedded motivator. Those that get involved early, get some bitcoins. The reward structure is built to encourage early adopters and then through that early adoption they are then incentivised to build and promote Bitcoin to make money. The miners who mine bitcoins are incentivised to run their miners in exchange for receiving money. There is motivation rewarded by money at every level.If Bitcoin were started by Satoshi and there was no reward, just "hey gang, let's do it for the community because the Federal Reserve is bad" then it would just be a white paper with a github account of code. Thanks. Hmm, I see that there are apps that accept LN transactions...perhaps there is some seed of something there. Thank you, I will do some studying. I think with this next run up I will dissolve any alt coin I have that has not produced what was initial promised when it was created.I am quite disappointed by MaidSafe. I bought those in the initial offering...back in 2013. They have nothing. Perhaps try to "time the market" and instead of selling bitcoins toward the top, sell all of my alts for fiat or Tethers. To buy back BTC during the 2 year dip back down to $60k.Outside of that, I recall watching a presentation by one of the Bitcoin developers talking about a scripting language he created to run in Bitcoin. I did not have time to play around with it then and the guy did say he was going to scrap it all and start from scratch with something better. Does anyone have a link to that presentation or know what it's called?Edit: My goal has been to try to create a Bitcoin company where nobody in the company needs to be known, but when a customer purchases a product from that company the funds are sent in the same way that a company works. It may go to the CEO, the treasurer (with some restrictions), shareholders, etc. with board members having a way of voting on new paths of revenue and being able to give/take away power from the CEO.Probably something that can be done in ETH but screw those guys. This is Bitcoin.I checked into RSK and that does not allow a customer to send bitcoins to the organization. They must first convert their BTC to RSK to then send. If you have no bitcoins, you are essentially a huge fan of Trump.Every Nocoiner: "Trump 2020. MAGA. No to Bitcoin" I got an e-mail from whatever MtGox trustee with a bunch of legal BS. I kinda ignored it all before because it was "only" .04 BTC and it is highly likely that the value they would compensate me for would be at the fiat value back in 2013.Who knows. I responded to the e-mail giving them consent to do whatever they explained in the e-mail. Maybe I'll get $40.As for kidneys...If you still have both kidneys and no bitcoins, you're doing life wrong. So it looks like I may be getting my .04 BTC back from MtGox.My retirement may continue. I am glad to see these small corrections on the way up.Once the price doubles in a month we are weeks away from the end of the bull run. It almost did that already going up from $7500 to $13,880. For the next week or so $16k would be the doubling.The longer we avoid doubling in a month the longer the bull run. Let it grow slowly for the next year. Then double when we hit $100k and sit back and watch the fireworks.  Some memorable haikus I remember from my English class in high school when they taught us about haikus.My friends:If I was hot dogthen everyone would like meI'd look like a dickchildren in the snowplaying laughing having funjoey is frozenMine, after my teacher told me haikus are usually about nature (I didn't really like my teacher):nature is real dumbso why is it always therelet's get rid of itI submitted mine to some poem thing where other kids got to comment on it.Needless to say, the comments were not too nice  Most common response "I think you're dumb. We should get rid of you" So my computer has some extra hard drive space, running Linux. Are there any cool blockchain projects that actually do some cool things (other than ICO and disappear) that I can play around with? I'm thinking like Maidsafe. But I just checked their site and they're in Alpha after over a decade of development.I know most ICOs basically made a bunch of money up front and bought lambos and moved on. Any decent ones?I'll likely install NMC just to browse some .bit websites. Maybe play around with IPFS. Yep, it was back in 2010 or so. The guy who built the seastead went there to encourage them to integrate Bitcoin as their currency.Of course, several people go there to try to influence them on many things. He said that there were people there from the Phillipines asking for fishing rights. In exchange they got the president(?) a brand new mercedes to drive around. On an island with about 5 miles of road. He said the guy there who is in charge of the FIFA vote has a lot of power as his one vote is equal to that of other powerful nations. He was there at the same time as congressman Alan Grayson but he did not know what he was there for.
As always, in these contests I post a price that I do not want so that the only consolation as I cry in my cheap beer is that I won a contest.$4200 Fortunately for us all. I am always wrong.   safe Getting better. Nadia and I got married and we're moving on with our lives. Using the term "gender" when referring to a human's sex has been traced back to the Victorian era when the term "sex" was taboo so using it in every day discussion was discouraged. Before that it was just used when referring to genders of words, etc.So those that use the term "gender" now are following the lead of the sexually oppressive. So interesting Saying "one eight" or "eighteen"it's still a haiku The only thing buying all of the colored coins would do is stall the conversion to bitcoin at a price of 100 times the bitcoin price. They still have fiat until that fiat is no longer necessary.The key hurdle here, I believe, is technical as opposed to economical. Having a country using colored coins in such small denominations as their cash requires a lot of tiny transactions. This cannot be done on the blockchain as the minimum transaction needs to be around 1k satoshis. It would need to be lightning network based. You would likely need some centralized lightning nodes to handle the transactions because on the Lightning Network you cannot see the source address. So you could send some non-colored coins (bought cheap) to the colored coin network.I have not figured out this technical challenge. This idea was pitched to Tuvalu with a new coin.That new coin was called Bitcoin.They had a fair shot. Yes, the likelihood is certainly low. But just having one small country try it and become successful leads to a domino affect among all other nations.I just think it would be good to hash out a sound strategy that could be executed if the right government gets put into a position of power that supports crypto.There would really be no way to "issue" stable colored coins. You are issuing 1 satoshi per "coin". That one satoshi may start out with a price of .001 cents, and fluctuate based on the bitcoin value over time. But people will still have satoshis. When the time comes that one satoshi equals one cent...then you can't dictate what the value is. People can now use that one satoshi as a cent anywhere in the world.You're essentially putting bitcoins into the hands of the people. Initially a tiny percentage of your overall money supply. Not enough for anyone to really notice. But as the price rises that percentage becomes larger and eventually dwarfs the value of the fiat in the money supply. Such that the fiat currency becomes irrelevant. This will happen globally but on a longer timeframe. Focusing on one forward thinking nation would boost their economy to the moon. All it takes is one intelligent politician in power (I know, not a likely scenario). Thanks for the informed response. And for welcoming me back...I am finally in a safe location and feel a bit more comfortable being on the Internet again.I am not sure if we are understanding each other on this. The colored coin would originally be pegged to the national currency.So in your example, the colored coin would be pegged to the Bulgarian leva (which is pegged to the euro). You are correct in assuming that the price of bitcoin would rise quickly once it is announced. So, say the bitcoin price jumps 30% on day one. If it is pegged then the rate will be the same. Nobody will notice the change in the underlying bitcoin. The value of a colored coin is determined by consensus. If the colored coin value is established to be the rate of some national exchange or some combinations of euro exchanges, then it will maintain the peg until 1 satoshi equals a set amount (ie .01 leva). When BTC is worth close to $1 million each then it is very likely that there will be no huge swings anymore.Having competing currencies may work too.I just think it would be wise to strategize how it could possibly done in case some bitcoin friendly government is ever elected somewhere.My friend went to Tuvalu when the price was around $2 encouraging them to switch over to bitcoin as their national currency. They could be richer than the US right now if they had.As for having the money up front to do it...I think if there is a list of addresses used as gateways into the colored coin addresses then one or two exchanges in the country could be used. Instead of having all of the money up front, as people start converting their fiat into the pegged coin it goes to that address. Leva exchanged for euros which are exchanged for bitcoins which are then filtered through that address to become colored coins (colored leva). The key being that over time, it won't matter if they are colored or not anymore as the values would match and the peg would be lifted. Oops...ventured into the dirty part of bitcointalk...forgot how it was out here.NVM I want LN to work but setting up a wallet is not as simple as downloading a bitcoin wallet and adding some funds.Last time I tried it I either had to have a node running that I attach to, or use some service that runs a node for me. And even then, I had a hard time with it.It's a similar problem with OpenBazaar. To buy or sell you need to download the software and run a node or pay for a service.It reminds me of when I was trying to use gold as a currency. You could pay for a service to hold your gold and secure it and then pay a percentage to spend it via a debit card. The whole point of why I like Bitcoin is that you don't have to pay a monthly fee for someone to secure it for you.Is there technology down the pipe that will make LN more user friendly? Is it possible? All of this is assuming cooperation with the nation whose currency you are replacing. They would need to be able to collect taxes, fines, pay for things with this currency.Also, it would not be necessary for all of the money to be reserved up front as a colored coin. An exchange or the government service could specify the addresses they will use as passthroughs to colored coins and as people convert to bitcoin the colored coins grow until they reach the threshold.Consider a country like Panama which has no central bank (and whose banks were just put on the gray list so they cannot do international wire transfers), they could easily do the transition without disrupting any powerful organization. The long term benefit is a more valuable currency that has more features than all other currencies while being able to compete globally.Going this route allows several years of transition which does require a central peg at start but is guaranteed to leave that peg once the value reaches a certain point. I have been doing some thinking on how one would gradually convert a national currency to bitcoins.The idea being that colored coins are used to peg the currency to the national currency for a specific amount of satoshis.The amount of satoshis would need to equal the amount that the specific nation could handle as the smallest value that can be used as a currency. Let's say that country X has a total of $100 billion of wealth in its own currency. To have each penny equal to one satoshi you would need 100,000 BTC set aside as colored coins for this nation (however that is done, a big national push, wealthy group, whichever).For simplicity let's say the current BTC price is $10k/BTC. $1 billion would be needed to set this up.Each colored satoshi will be given the value of .001 cents at the current conversion rate, and follow the rate of the nation's currency either through some sort of smart contract or centrally controlled ("trusted" sources) method.People then use these colored coins in their day to day transactions, setting up payment terminals, lightning network payments, etc. It's just a new payment method with their same currency using a back end network that they need not understand.As the bitcoin price rises from $10k/BTC to $1 million/BTC, their satoshis are now equal to one penny.It is at this point that the moniker of their old currency is dropped and they use the satoshi as the smallest denomination, 100 satoshi as their main currency. They can now interact with this currency with the full Bitcoin network.It may take years, but the adoption of this method for the nation would push that bitcoin price toward that $1 million/BTC and the same approach can be done for other nations.TL;DR Smallest currency denomination is pegged to colored satoshis until one satoshi equals the smallest currency denomination and it is no longer colored.Thoughts?  Bump for relevance. I was so close to buying Chipotle stock when they IPOed. I likely would have done better than putting $40k into SAIC. Likely timeline for the restaurant is a matter of months. I'm in for a busy summer (people keep asking if I get bored on the seastead...).The likelihood of our seastead getting rekt is very minimal. I think we've seen the biggest winds for the year while we were out there our first few weeks. We woke up every morning expecting some damage but it was just fine.The production version will be extra safe. The interior of the spar will be completely void of any holes (seacocks/valves/etc). So in the very worst case scenario you can close off your spar and hunker down like going into your basement. Or you have the option of staying in your platform which is also a life raft. The two are not connected so if the spar sinks, the platform stays up. If the platform falls off (or something happens to it) you can go into the spar.But most likely if the storm of the century is coming through...you go to one of the nearby islands and wait out the storm. We are building the seasteads to withstand 5 meter waves. Where we are located the highest wave we should see in 100 years is 5 meters. High but rare. Average is about .5 meter waves. If you count the floors down inside the spar as living space as well as the deck on top then you get close to 100 sqm with just our $150k seastead. But we certainly do not plan on keeping them that small. We just want to keep the costs down. But we have big plans for business and mansion setups with underwater bedrooms that look out into the water.  With the restaurant we are doing a 10m diameter underwater room. That one room is close to 80 sqm.Unless they brought their own means of getting onto the seastead it will take them a long time to get up and likely risk destroying their boat in the process. Right now we have to moor our boat, lower the dinghy, take the dinghy to the ladder and climb up. We could literally watch any "pirates" for about 10 minutes as they prepare for their grand caper. For those that don't care to fight, just lock yourself inside the spar and wait for them to leave.My gf keeps trying to grow sea grapes (seaweed) but the fish keep eating it. Or it dies before we get it into the water. Haven't gotten around to growing anything yet since we have plenty of food from the grocery store.I think the key to the seastead that people miss is the awesome opportunity for SCUBA divers. I am working on growing coral on the outside of my spar which will also protect the steel from rusting. There are an insane amount of fish already swimming around down there. With coral there will be more. There is a lot of SCUBA tourism in the area. We will likely be a new destination for them.The restaurant should be pretty big. It will bring people out to see the seastead for themselves. Small is easy. We're selling our DIY seasteads for $45k. This includes just a spar and a 7 meter wide steel plate that you can then customize as you wish.When thinking of seasteading start thinking in terms of boats instead of vast lands. The more open/empty space, the more the price.Excluding everything, that barebones DIY will cost you about $108/sqft or $1169/sqm. You may consider that your "land" price. On top of that we build a fully self reliant home with solar electricity and fresh water (which brings the price up considerably).We set up whatever, arbitrarily. As long as it's over 12nm out we can put our seasteads there. But that comes with big waves which requires engineering to keep you above the waves.While we do not plan on building off of the coast of Somalia where there are pirates...A pirate is defined as theft on the sea. If you're trying to find a place in the world where there are no thieves...good luck! Being a long boat ride where everyone can see you coming for miles is probably discouraging to most thieves. Also, us pulling up the ladder is likely better than a gun. I just had a group come out here last week to visit the seastead. One of them wants to do exactly that.He wants to set up a SeaBnB on a few of these and get about 10 people to go in on one to split the cost/profit. He's figuring a 65% occupancy rate over 3 years pays for itself.The configuration would be just a bed and bathroom instead of the standard which comes with a kitchen.We also have a big investor that wants to set up an underwater restaurant. People visiting the restaurant will want a place to stay the night. We're figuring a capacity of 40 high end customers.
I'm setting up my own BTCPay server for payments from people buying seasteads.It's actually not too difficult if you go the LunaNode route (An ISP has integrated all of the packages for you with an easy to use configuration page).So that took me a few hours this morning (Originally I was setting everything up on my computer but decided, screw it...I'll take the easy route).As a special tribute to the dollar, we're doing our Initial Seastead Offering (ISeaO) on April 15th.Protest the income tax by putting your 1% downpayment on buying a seastead.https://ocean.builders/april-15th-initial-seastead-offering/ A lot of people still use fiat.They're in for a big surprise. Knowing the people involved in this, I assume that this "UN roundtable discussion" was a few people gathered around a table at the UN building in New York. They may have had one employee of the UN with them. They discussed seasteading. Then marketed it as the UN wanting to build a floating city. That would be me. Chad Elwartowski...hence the nickname 'Elwar'. Alive and kicking. Been very busy. We're preparing to do a workshop teaching new seasteaders the basics.We'll be doing a video about it. Ya, I just sold $50 billion worth of bitcoins to the coinmarketcap website. He said I should get my money in the mail in about a week. Probably why the price is down there. The barebones price for the production model will be about $150k. We're still working to narrow down the price with our contractor.The production model will be twice as deep with a more streamlined design to deal with wind and waves better. The platform will have a walk around deck as well as the second floor 360 degree ocean view deck. The windows will also be much bigger.Noise isn't bad at all. Similar to being inside a boat. The production version will have insulation. Ventilation has been fine, we live with the door open because no bugs. A fan is all we need for staying cool. Turn it off at night because it gets too cool.A/C will be an optional add on. We have our second video out about raising the seastead.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c83TiSJ6sfAHere's the first in case you missed it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTXhgcXA1pM We accept bitcoin for our seasteads   Episode 2 of the seastead docudrama.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c83TiSJ6sfAYou even get a glimpse of the interior of the seastead.Everyone keeps requesting we show them video of the inside but neither Nadia nor I are clean freaks so cleaning has not been a priority yet. No guests means nobody to judge. The #1 question we get is about all of these so called "pirates" that are apparently just roaming the seas looking for targets.Seriously...who will go so far out of the way to rob a house that's not on land when there are millions of houses on land? I'm a minimalist so I literally only have a very small amount of things to take. My bitcoins? Good luck...cold storage in the states. There are some beers in the fridge...perhaps that's what they're after?We are surrounded by a huge amount of fishing boats. We have CB radio and VHF. The fishing boats are all around us day and night. You can see their lights all night as they catch fish. They are in international waters. There are no reports of pirates attacking them and taking their much more valueable fish.I think a can of soup would be affective as they're trying to climb up onto the platform with no ladder.  Taxes are just not a thing for corporations. Not when there are countries you can incorporate in that have no taxes.Yes, some countries have no income or capital gains taxes. Imagine that. Well, you don't really have to imagine because they exist. I predict the price will go down below $3200 in the next 2 weeks  And that will be the bottom as we begin the long climb to all new heights. So....Bitcoin wasn't legit until a couple lived on it for a year?I have 2-5 covered. For 1...why? Does Hong Kong produce its own food? Is trade not allowed on your seastead?"true seastead"... So many people with their own definitions of what they think a seastead should be. That's kinda the point of seasteading. If you don't like my seastead, don't live near me. Don't buy one. Enjoy land and its creeping communism.I'm done responding to you. You are never satisfied. Even when a seastead is in the water fully self sufficient with solar, water, internet and (guess what? fish thrive on organic waste) sewage you aren't satisfied.I'll just pop some imported champagne (grown in Hungary, drunk in the Andaman Sea) and enjoy life on the seastead.#seasteadernotaffected I think these high polluting countries get quite a bit of help from the media hyping their tiny eco friendly projects. I see on Facebook posts about how great China is at building renewable energy. Even though they have full cities that are black from pollution. Many people will be looking back in 10 years wishing they had gotten into seasteading in the beginning just like they are saying about Bitcoin.Those same people will call me "lucky" for having got in in the beginning.It's not luck. Drive a motorbike in Thailand long enough and you will find out that roads hurt. A lot. I think people miss the point that this is a proof of concept. A prototype. When a car company spends millions on a new model car prototype do you say "why not just go buy a car from the dealership? It's a lot cheaper".This is going to be big. Living on the land is for the animals. The next frontier is above the waves. Ya, I've always understood that I am not anonymous since the early days of the Internet. Elwar has been my nickname since I was in 2nd grade, a shortened version of Elwartowski. A simple google search would find a lot of boring past things I've been involved in. Maybe back to the days of MUDding. What does wealth have to do with having a good heart?The key here is that by having our own property on the sea that makes it our responsibility. That means we must take care of it since nobody else will.Check out the tragedy of the commons. Basicaly, those places that are owned by nobody goes to shit because nobody has a stake in it. The plastic we see floating by our seastead comes from land. Poor countries literally dump their garbage in the ocean. Do they not have good hearts?
Not many laws. We are still subject to maritime law (law of the sea) which prevents eggrevious acts such as murder or slave trafficing, etc.Being still within the Thai EEZ we cannot drill for oil or other natural resources.None of those laws affect us though. We are not planning on being out here alone forever. We have many people interested in buying and once we have 20 orders we will begin the process of bringing more people.We will be building the seasteads from the seastead site. So plenty of jobs and potential for investors. Seasteading is all about sovereignty. Living on a boat on a lake makes you subject to all of the laws of your nation. Seasteading is about not being under any laws of any nation and building a new society with a blank slate.The only way to do that in the past was through a violent revolution. Seasteading is doing so peacefully.As for waves (and the inevitable "pirate") questions, check out https://ocean.builders/faq I'm famous! Guess it's time to move to Hollywood and get into the drug scene. Then end up broke in the gutter until years later when they ask "where are they now?" where I clean up for the interview as everyone says how brave I am.One can dream... Looking at Saturday.Sanding down to bare metal before putting the paint on. An early Bitcoin investor and self-confessed libertarian has built the first seastead with his BTC profits. For those who do not know, a seastead is a floating home designed to stay in international waters, thus allowing its inhabitants to live outside of the laws of any nation....https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/03/01/bitcoin-seastead/ The production version will certainly be circular with foam insulation. The bottom rounded slightly and the small cylinder longer so that there is less surface area for the waves.We have learned a lot through this process that we are putting into the next version. The next one will be twice as deep with much much more living space. While sticking with the proven parts of the design.Cost will be around $150k for the basic design with nice add ons up to 200k or so. We even priced in an underwater viewing room but that puts it up to 400k.A very barebones DIY structure with just the spar and a steel plate will be available for 45k. Sort of like just buying the land. As I saw the bitcoin price go up over $4k I thought 'good, we're out of the slump on our way back up (a little soon but that's ok)'.Then I was like...'oh shit, I'm buying $200 a day on Coinbase, now I'm getting less BTC...wish it was back under $4k again'.I wish I wasn't limited to $200 a day at these low prices.I think we either have seen the bottom or will see the bottom this month before the long climb upwards. Something about 14 months before the halving the price begins to rise.. I started working for the government right out of college. I've had no chance at privacy since then.  Well, our friend is working on this project so until we get our boat he is our main source of transport.We had a kayak for emergencies but I lost it in a storm. Sort of my fault, but didn't want to risk getting in the big waves to save it.We have Internet. A cell tower can reach us and we have a repeater to reach back to it. Phone Internet is around 10-20Mbps. Thanks.First video is now available.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTXhgcXA1pM&feature=share Thanks. Second video coming out Monday.  Hey all, sorry for posting and disappearing. I've been so busy since getting the seastead up that I hardly have any time to get on bitcointalk anymore.Been answering many queries from a lot of different sources (Facebook, seasteadtalk.org, ocean.builders, etc.) as well as preparing the next 20 seasteads.Most of your questions are answered here: https://ocean.builders/faq (yes, even the pirate question)It has been myself and my gf Nadia living on the seastead for the past month though we are currently taking a break in Phuket to buy a boat and have the bottom painted. Life on the seastead is great and always full of adventure. If you've ever lived on a boat you may know how things go. The prototype we are on was at about the 90% completion stage so that last 10% is me working on things. The water maker was a challenge since they are meant to be gravity fed which tends to mean they are usually installed under water. But ours is about 2 meters above the water. Buying a pump and then finding out you have the wrong sized hose and such minor problems turn into a longer process when the store is a boat ride back into town. Without our own boat we have to rely on my friend to come out periodically.We did experience some big winds one night up to 25 knots which rocked the platform a bit. Our engineer noted that the seastead is not "rigid" enough. Meaning that a small movement on the bottom turns into big movement at the top. We are in the process of adding some steel frames where before we had steel cables (which can give a small amount of flexibility). Last time we were working on that our welder lost his mask to the ocean and we didn't have a spare. With our own boat we can make more regular trips but relying on our friend makes things take a bit longer.But it is, afterall, just a prototype which has taught us quite a bit. Our production version will be quite amazing while still keeping the costs low. It will be twice as deep, have rounded walls for the wind factor, smaller area at the water line for the waves and the spar underwater will have rooms (with windows if you want).There is a lot of interest, a lot of people want time shares so we're working to accommodate that option. We are setting up a seasteading adventure to show people the seastead while teaching them the ropes of being a seasteader (literally...ropes).As for the title of this thread...it's a bit on the joking side since there are only 2 of us living there so accepting bitcoin for anything is a bit unnecessary since we're not selling anything. But we'll accept them if you want to give it to us  But the company selling seasteads, Ocean Builders, will be accepting bitcoins for orders. We are a bunch of early adopters that are finally able to afford building some pretty cool stuff. We fully support Bitcoin. We hope to begin producing the next set of seasteads in the next few months (at least get the ball running as far as giving contractors the green light to start setting up their production). Next week we get the final cost estimate from our last contractor then we set up our company and start taking deposits (20% down).Adding to the activity, we are releasing the first video in a series of videos about getting the seastead up.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTXhgcXA1pM&feature=share I have checked a few of them and would love to play with one. We are curious about the bottom which is 60 meters down. At the very least I can see if a few dropped wrenches and my GoPro are down there.I did dive down to the bottom of the seastead for some pictures.https://ocean.builders/a-view-from-below-the-seastead/ Here is the first video in a series of videos we're doing about the seastead.https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=share&v=tTXhgcXA1pM Hey all. Been busy lately with the seastead and I just bought a sail boat as a commuter (my friend was our taxi while we waited to get the boat). Having the bottom stripped to bare metal (steel hull) and painted.Here's the first video in a series about us getting the seastead up.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tTXhgcXA1pMLooking forward to the day that I can sit back and relax and hang out on the forums again. But we have seasteads to build. They are fans of western men. And they want to be a woman...not a man (unlike in the west). If you don't want to see trannies, avoid any leftist female in the US. Either way, your bitcoin goes a long way here. Beer run is about 12 nautical miles to the closest 7-11 (this is Thailand, I am sure a 7-11 will pop up here any minute. Maybe 3). Just had our first visitor yesterday. He brought a case of beer and left with our trash. We polute landfills responsibly like everyone else.As for major storms, hurricanes, tsunamis...The highest waves all year might reach 2 meters in the roughest storms. 10 year high is upwards of 4 meters and the 100 year freak wave rating here is 5 meters. We are able to take a 5 meter wave and would likely get a wet kitchen floor but that's it.There are no hurricanes here and as far as tsunamis which killed thousands of people here about 15 years ago...we are the safest place to be. We would just rise with the swell and go back down without really noticing. Meanwhile everything on the coast gets wiped out.The whole seastead is able to raise and lower with the press of a few buttons. About a 2 meter range.We are sitting pretty low because the seas are calm this time of year. Worst waves this month are around .5 meters. https://ocean.builders/first-seastead-has-been-set-up-in-international-waters/ https://ocean.builders/first-seastead-has-been-set-up-in-international-waters/ You can tell it's not true because only dems use the term MAGA while Trump supports actually say the words "make America great again"
Community? We're building homes on the sea. Who said anything about building a community? Dear bitcoin price,  WTF?-Hodler And here everyone's worried about how a seastead will deal with some bad weather.You live in a place where your exposed skin freezes if you go outside for more than a minute! It is already a large 2 meter tube 20 meters deep. The water level should not come up to the 7 meter mark.All of that 7 meters can be utilized. For storage or...I've really got my sights on a very large smoker...for smoking all of the fish I catch. And buying large amounts of meat and smoking it so it lasts longer. Another suggestions was a micro brew. I started buying $200 daily because that's all Coinbase allows me to buy. Set up a recurring buy.I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight.I love cheap coinz. That wasn't real democracy.Wow...it is really easy. Just take a failed system that you're trying to sell again...just say the old system wasn't the real version of it.Hmm...perhaps we can resurrect the Roman empire? Because that wasn't a real empire.Mingh dynasty? Not a real dynasty.You communists may be onto something here... That's the key question. No amount of computer models will tell us. The spar is pretty stable on its own. The platform is stable on its own. Hopefully the two combined is stable. Joe came out last month and spent about 3 weeks with us. He was able to watch the platform go in the water.He is putting full support of the seasteading institute behind it because it's the first actual seastead being built. Well, the platform actually acts as a life raft so hopefully it wouldn't look that bad.Here it is being prepared for putting on the spar.Unfortunately we had to call off the raising that day since the wind and waves just got worse throughout the day. Still waiting for some perfect waves, should be some time this week. I have most of the specs here: https://www.seasteadtalk.org/forum/engineering-discussion/51-xlii-specsThe spar is rolled steel tubes about 1.5 meters each welded together to get to the 20 meters. 14mm thick steel.Ballast area on the bottom is about 1.5 meters walled off then filled with concrete. We also added about 10 tons of sand to the main area that became ballast when we flipped it.Initial cost was around $30k but being a prototype and never having done this before we had to pay another $10k or so for incidentals.Now that we have the process down we will likely be making mass steel purchases from China to bring that cost down for the production version, while ramping up the quality.If you're up for seasteading we are hoping to move most of the metal and fiberglass work to the seastead so that we can grow the economy of the seastead by building seasteads. If it weren't super expensive and I need to have a base station on land and a stable location for it. Then ya.I think by the time we look at dedicated antennas the satellite broadband Internet will be out. Talks of 2020 or so were brought up. Would love to see your system in action. Ya, the hope is that early on nobody even pays attention. I wanted to put mine in the water before sharing it with the world because I learned from the Blue Frontiers French Polynesia fiasco that people and the media will paint a scary picture of what seasteading can be. If they see my little house in the water and people try to say it's scary then they'll try to figure out what's so scary about a small floating house in the water. I like graphene but it has been found that it could be deadly to humans.It is so small and strong that if it gets into your body it tears your cells to shreds. I am reluctant to drink from a filter that may have many tiny graphene particles in it that will dice up my cells.If it works then that would be great. Cheaper water makers for the seasteads. Yes. That is how we get Internet.My phone is not powerful enough to transmit to the tower. But we bought a pocket Wifi and we're able to upload at about 1kbps. I have a repeater with an antenna that I'll be trying out when we get back to the site.If that does not get us what we need I will have to spend $3k on a booster.Download can get to around 3Mbps though. We were sitting out there listening to Youtube music. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzcv5TJkJBA Well...we have the hose in the kitchen sink to fresh water. And the bathroom. Only other room is the bedroom.This isn't a Blue Frontiers seastead where we theorize about all sorts of tech that has been done in some lab somewhere. We buy stuff at the store and use it. I thought he was talking about ham radio. Looks like you can. I still connect directly via manual routing to every website I go to.I don't just connect to the closest node on the network and have my traffic propagated through the network.I wish the Internet and Lightning Network worked that way but they don't. You have to connect directly to each place you want to spend money.  Anyone heard of these Tangem cards?https://tangem.com/$5 per card needs to come down but the tech is quite cool. Just verify on your phone that there's money on the card and you can exchange bitcoins offline.
How many catamarans in the ocean have water pumps for fire suppression? The platform I'm in is close to the living space of a large catamaran (at a much lower price).A fire extinguisher should be fine. Actually Sealand is the closest thing to a seastead.  Gazillion seems legit.Make it so. Sure a boat can be built in international waters, it's the living on the boat in international waters part that is the most difficult.A boat is built so that it needs to continue moving forward in waves for stability.This was the plan of former seastead project Blueseed. They wanted to buy a large boat and just continue to drive in a figure 8 pattern perpetually. Figuring people would pay for the gas in exchange for the benefit of living on the seastead. Solar would require too much energy. They could do nuclear like submarines.But to stay in one place you need different technology from a boat. It's closer to an oil platform than a boat. So you use the tech of oil platforms instead of boat tech. Sovereignty.Not just in the aspect of individuals being sovereign, but starting from sovereignty and growing from there. Meaning any community that forms starts from scratch when it comes to laws.You can put some house boats together and have your own laws. But those are in addition to the nation whose harbor you are sitting in. So you are basically the same as boaters in a marina with some additional marina regulations. Production versions will likely use composting toilets. Fertilizer can be used for plants on the deck or tossed overboard.The ocean is kinda big. Fish, whales, dolphins poop in it all the time. If you want the nasty truth...pooping into the ocean is a good thing. The fish and micro-organisms eat that stuff right up and thrive. I have no plans on becoming a nation. The first 20 owners will be laying the ground work for future governance. If they want to move in that direction then that will be the direction of seasteading in the near term.Personally, I don't want to be a citizen of any country that would have me. Why does everyone automatically think a seastead has to have some super expensive space technology? It's mostly boat like. We use boat tech. A toilet that pumps water like on a boat. Water maker like on a boat. As flammable as a boat. We have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen.No flying cars or 2 million dollar submarines.No hydrofoil boats for commuting. We use solar for electricity with gas generator backup and propane for cooking. No nuclear power or thorium power plant. Nah...looks like they hate money. So what's the deal with Coinbase limits? I logged in after a while and I'm limited to $200 per day transfer from my bank account.I have everything verified. How do I request an increase? Any time I've checked out boat rentals you can usually buy the boat for about 4 to 6 months of rental.I'm planning on buying a cheap $10k small boat now then buy something better later. It just needs to float and get me 12 nautical miles. We're also in high season here so all the boat prices are more expensive. I need to buy a boat soon...I don't want to sell at the bottom.I have cash set aside that I can live on through 2020...but not "I can buy a sail boat" cash...puts me closer to living through 2019.Then again...on the seastead I will only need to pay for food that I don't catch. And about $12 for Internet each month.No property taxes, electric, water...Occassional propane and gasoline re-fill. So maybe I am putting myself to 2025 funds... I don't want seastead nations just as I do not want Bitcoin banks.Collaborate as you see fit or don't collaborate at all.I'm not saying "let's end nation states" I'm saying, let's create a better alternative. May as well ask Lagoon or Catalina how many of the boats they make are going to be used as churches.Ocean Builders just builds seasteads. We are leaving it to the first 20 owners to design the foundation for future seastead systems. If you want to help decide what systems will be used for future seasteading then you should go to https://ocean.builders and fill out the form stating that you're interested in buying one.Though just because the first 20 may decide on one system it does not imply that everyone else must follow it. But they will have first mover advantage with network affect.  The production versions will have active mooring which will allow you to move your home as you see fit. If you don't like your neighbors...just move.As for initially being occupied. My gf and I will have plenty to do. We lived in a small bungalow in Tahiti and spent most of our time there. Her cooking and me on the 'net or reading.We can go SCUBA diving and swimming. I plan on growing a coral garden on the spar and raising reef fish. Drone fishing...Most importantly we have Internet so I'll never get bored.And we can go into town. Either to Phuket or one of the islands.But I imagine as people begin moving out there we will be very busy helping the newcomers get adjusted. Not everyone is like the US. Seasteading gets downplayed a lot because it likely cannot happen anywhere near the US. Because of hurricanes, huge waves and the US Navy.There is a world outside of the US though. I've considered creating some sort of honey pot paid access guide on how to do XYZ illegal thing. Charge a couple thousand dollars to access it. Then just let law enforcement pay to access it to collect their evidence. Only to find that it's just cat pics.I was thinking the same honeypot for journalists but they don't actually research anything, they'd just report that it exists without ever checking it out. The price...FMLMay is too far away. I need to buy a few things now.I guess I convert from my US dollars to bitcoins to baht instead of just selling at these prices. There are already boating communities.At 12nm out you have no laws other than things like resource laws (no drilling for oil, etc.) and no interfering with customs. The law of the sea which prevents "egregious acts" such as murder, slave trade, etc. There's the barebones minimum vs fully macked out version.I figure there will be add ons like A/C, more solar, dynamic positioning system, teak floors, upgraded kitchen, etc.
That's the thing. We have no country preventing us from doing something about it.  Here are the specshttp://www.seasteadtalk.org/forum/engineering-discussion/51-xlii-specsWe put the platform on the spar next week. Weather was horrible on our last attempt. This is a picture before it goes onto the spar.Unfortunately waves were too bad on launch day so we are waiting a week to combine them. Seastead nation starts at zero debt.All nations are now behind us on the economic balance sheet. I plan on growing biorock on the spar in order to foster the growth of coral for a very large coral garden that will make for a perfect environment for fish.It also helps to prevent corrosion of the steel spar. Seasteading is not just living on a houseboat. It involves living at least 12 nautical miles outside of a nation's territorial waters.A house boat cannot just sit in such waters due to the waves.Ocean Builders seasteads are built on top of a spar which allows you to live above the waves.As for price...we are targeting $150-$200k. First 20 will get the seastead at cost, and help to decide the way forward for future seasteading. We're about 20 minutes to the closest restaurant by speed boat. 30 minutes and a ride through traffic to the nearest hospital. Where I lived before it was usually an hour drive in traffic to the main shopping area so you just go a few times a week or less. Though I am in the process of buying a small sail boat. It has an engine and I'll add an outboard for redundancy. Plus the sail. So a liesurely ride into town could take an hour or so. We're only 12nm from Phuket Thailand so fairly close to anything we need. My gf fills up our Internet with her Thai bank account. I fill the account as needed via bitcoin exchange.Food and Internet should be our only expenses. And we hope to catch/grow more food over time.But Thai food is cheap. I want to put a big smoker in the big spar.  I have worked night shift in Afghanistan for 2 years. I enjoy serene.Hopefully I can do drone fishing   $3351 Over 12nm out.We describe it all at http://ocean.builders My gf and I will be living there. We will be doing plenty of blogging and updating.I created http://www.seasteadtalk.org for discussion of seasteading. We are at around 3Mbps download and 1Mbps upload with just a small pocket Wifi device. I have an antenna booster that should get that up closer to 20Mbps. The key here is distance. Yes. We are installing a water maker that creates 60 liters of water per hour. The platform will sit atop this spar.More on how Ocean Builders plans on dealing with waves.https://ocean.builders/waves Further prospect is https://ocean.builders I'm out at the site. Moored up for the evening after getting the spar anchored. https://ocean.builders/the-worlds-first-seastead-is-in-the-water/The first seastead is in the water. https://ocean.builders/the-worlds-first-seastead-is-in-the-water/It's happening!
The key part of seasteading is a higher degree of sovereignty. More than just a house boat. International waters is ideal. Any home in international waters needs to be able to handle the waves.Our spar design allows us to live above the waves.I am currently in a boat towing the platform out to international waters where it will be placed on top of a 20 meter long spar. This will allow the platform to be 5 meters above the water. The location we will be has 5 meter waves maybe once in 100 years. https://ocean.builders/the-worlds-first-seastead-is-in-the-water/World's first seastead is in the water. https://ocean.builders/the-worlds-first-seastead-is-in-the-water/World's first seastead is in the water. Genesis spar in the water January 3, 2019. Looks like this guy had it. Genesis spar in the water January 3, 2019.More info coming Jan. 9 This price is shit. Coal for everyone's stocking today. The more sad faces the better. I find it sad that the fascists and the communists are no longer hiding behind their previous softer labels and are being a bit more bold in feeling they should publicly express their fascist and communist ideals so boldly.At least for a while the communists were calling themselves democratic socialists. Fascists were ok with staying in their KKK tea parties or wherever they were hiding.Now they're just inundating social media with their nonsense as if it's perfectly normal. Remember when the price was over $10k?So long ago. These low prices should make everyone sad every second of every day.  Prediction. Price shoots up over 100k on Jan. 3. But nobody has bitcoins on the exchange to sell. By the time they are back on the exchange the price is back down to the Jan 2 price.  I interviewed for a job for a company that does exactly that. Collects all food purchase information for a majority of the grocery stores in the US going back to the 70s.It's similar to Google in that they then sell that information to merchants that use the information to target ads and coupons etc. to the individual. itBit is the best way to do OTC in the US.That's where places like BitPay and others do large OTC trades daily. Does Western Union meet you at the hotel lobby when you arrive in a new country to personally give you local currency with the click of a button on your phone?Until they provide that good of service they can't compete with localbitcoins.Also...it sounds like WU has no clue about their potential role in crypto. They think they would somehow be some sort of company to send crypto to crypto. Their role would be to compete with localbitcoins and provide exchange services worldwide.They likely won't get it until after they are shuttering their doors. Any idea of the timing of the pump and the Fed announcing interest rate hikes? Before or after the announcement? So much for that rally. Was a nice break from the constant daily drops but it looks like we're on our way back to further destruction and misery.  Classic Roger Ver dropping his bitcoins meme.Never gets old. Price is still under $10k.   I post scary things more to scare myself so I don't get my hopes up.I will still anticipate 2018 being a wash and look forward to a fresh start in 2019. Big things (tm) coming in 2019. The year is not yet over and Gox likely wants to sell the rest before Jan 1.I will hold out all hope until 2019.I will also pull my keys from the exchange.I put my "boat money" on the exchange to cash out at a certain price but it never hit the target. It's still on the exchange waiting.Will begin the process of taking them off before the 3rd because of how exchanges change things.
So....wex keeps getting its domain dropped.It seems like it would be handy to have some sort of cryptocurrency based domain name that they could use...If only...They could even sell that currency on their exchange.Some sort of domain Name Coin or something.. Yep. I used to point people to Coinbase just because most people asking are not very knowledgable so Coinbase is an easy way in.Now I'll just send a link to the white paper. They will likely never ask again. I lost. I'm so sad.    I think the most important thing we can learn from the bear market from 2014 is that Bitcoin died and was never heard from again. We all packed our bags and bought war bonds and got government jobs. Some of us ran for office where the real change takes place.  We're still at accumulation prices. Nowhere close to FOMO prices yet.This is the time when you should recommend to people you actually care about to get into Bitcoin. Not just buy but understand it. (ie...send them a link to the white paper).When the price shoots up and you start getting e-mails from people asking if they should get into "crypto", politely point them to some videos about the Federal Reserve, Austrian economics, etc. Then if they're still interested (knowing they get it)...then show them the white paper. Thank you. Does anyone know when bitcointalk.org was created?I did a whois and it shows 2011 but I remember being here in 2010. I answered the poll honestly. I don't know.I doubt anyone willknow until months later. Well, another night I go to sleep knowing that I will wake up to a lower bitcoin price.We thought this was a quick band aid rip off.Instead it's a slow bleed draining the life from us. GF needs to get a job and buy the dip.Told my gf yesterday she is done shopping. BTC is too low. She was ok with that. Difference being that -this time- Bitcoin will end.Because stuff and things. r0ach is already keeping an eye on us I did computer stuff. It's a good thing the guy is an idiot.If the letter was more articulate then it would be an obvious CIA project and a bomb would actually be detonated. That was my job...defense contractor.Iraq and Afghanistan jobs pay the big money. You work 12 hour days, 7 days a week 365 days a year. And being in a war zone you get an extra 50% or so on top of your salary. So the amount of time plus salary bonus leads to very good income.But it is certainly taxing on the soul and there's also the possibility of getting hit by a bomb. Last time I was there a bomb hit about 100m from where I was sitting, went off right outside the toilets I usually go to. Before that they discovered an unexploded bomb in the ground. I had walked over that location several times. $3498Same reason as previous guesses. Bear guess so I can feel a little better if the price stays so low. With the price this low it reminds me of the last downturn. I told my boss that I would take any job anywhere in the world no matter how much of a shithole or how dangerous as long as I made a lot of money. I knew that the bear market wouldn't last that long and I wanted to get as much bitcoin as I could gobble up in the mean time. Unfortunately it took a while before I found a job in Afghanistan just as the price was starting to move upwards.Either way I put every last bit of fiat into bitcoin during the bear market. Take advantage of the opportunity you are being given right now. Ahh, I see. Yes, the French Polynesia thing will have legal contracts and restrictions as agreed upon between Blue Frontiers and the French Polynesian government. But that one is far from happening. Still waiting on the government to get its act together which could be a few years.The private seasteads (in a different location) will happen sooner than that. Every year there is an event called ephemerisle. A bunch of people in a California bay get together and build floating structures and have a week long party.Some structures form islands and some require that you sign a contract before you can come aboard. The contracts are usually something like "I promise not to hurt anyone, litter, steal, etc.".Each one has a different contract."Seasteading" is not one thing that will be governed by one thing. You might come to my house and I have one set of rules and go to someone else's house and they have other rules. Some people may combine their houses and have an agreed upon set of rules. I fully expect that if seasteading reaches the point where they are trying to form nations, they will have more nations than currently exist. Think alt coins but in the physical space. There may be some main ones but it will continuously be splitting off into other forms. January has not been that great for bitcoin. Everyone paying their credit card bills for Christmas...Also, new tax year to sell bitcoins.
That's not very good criteria (Coinbase and all...).I do not doubt that at some point BitPay will forsake all profit and drop Bitcoin for Bcash as the only accepted currency.They already hardly accept bitcoin. They advertise Bcash every transaction, adding transaction fees for each bitcoin transaction, eating bcash transaction fees.I'd ask how they even stay in business but I'm sure their bcash shilling pretty much shows where they're getting the money to keep their doors open. I had a girlfriend in Cluj for a while. Hope my influencing her to get into Bitcoin didn't play a role in this kid getting arrested.Then again, I got ripped off by some Romanians for about 35 BTC so if he's part of them I hope they're sending him off to the north pole to attach his nuts to Santa's sleigh. Like most of the other ICOs it was just bad timing. They missed the boom last year and tried to do an ICO during the bear cycle. They set a minimum raise amount and did not hit that number so they refunded everyone's money.They also ran into problems in French Polynesia with the government...it was election season so the opposition used Blue Frontiers as an opportunity to turn it into an election time issue making up all sorts of false claims to try to win votes. In the end the party attacking the project lost. But in order to save face the government backed down from their promises during the election and couldn't figure out a way to get back to it afterwards. There is still some work going on there in French Polynesia to have it on one of the remote islands but time will tell. Blue Frontiers started expanding to other countries during the whole thing so hopefully a new destination crops up.It's probably good that they didn't get enough funding since it was raised in ETH and since this summer the price has crashed. The project would have failed while also taking a lot of peoples' money. Plenty in here were concerned about the price going up too high. We were wishing it would just stabilize many times as it kept going up too quickly. A single company creating a single seastead is working on an agreement with French Polynesia.Imagine the first person to come up with the concept of a "house". They go to the chief of the little village and negotiate a location for their new technology of 4 walls and a roof. There is an official agreement in that village for a house that is to be built. It will be amazing. All of your dreams will come true.And then there's another guy thousands of miles away with the same idea. He doesn't even discuss it with his village chief, he just goes into the woods and builds a small house. Or even...has his friends build him a house. In exchange they get some coconuts or some meat from his last catch.Then his friends decide to build houses near his house.No government is needed just because a house is built. Same for seasteading. Just build it and live in it. If you want to interact with your neighbors, interact. If you don't like how your neighbor interacts with you...move your house.It's really that simple.Seasteading creates these images of fantasy land where all of your dreams come true. That's why I won't be talking about the project I'm working on because unless someone sees it in action the concept of seasteading comes with all sorts of baggage. People either believe it solves all problems or creates all problems. They already have an image in their head of what seasteading is. And all of those ideas are different from everyone else's ideas. But their idea is the best...because reasons. By getting into the habit of spending your bitcoins it means you need to hold less fiat.If you're not spending your bitcoins...what do you have that you can spend? First rule of hat club.Don't quote roach. Subscribing so that on Dec. 14 I can add $1 to the highest bidder.This is the only thing I learned from Price is Right. From my wall observations, looks like they want to push the price down below $3200.This shit sucks. It's one of the few places left where you can spend your bitcoins online.Unfortunately.I'm to the point of considering ordering a credit card. My Amex was supposed to be only for emergencies but I've racked up plenty of useless sky miles over the past year with it.At least purse doesn't make you use some obscure wallet to pay for things like BitPay does (while pushing BCH). I don't ever plan on getting married.Nobody is worth half of my bitcoins. I highly recommend this chrome extension that allows you to buy things on Amazon (via purse.io) at a discount. Oh ya...and pay with bitcoins of course.https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/purse-shop-with-bitcoin-b/amdginnpaflghjbbdkfenpekaeifnpee I did a test buy at $3300 to see if my bank would allow it.Then another slightly larger test as it was coming back up.Will buy more as it bounces around that number. I'm not sure of the clinical diagnosis for depression but...the price is way too low Bitcoin SV has no wallet that compiles on anyone's computer but CSW. It will grow slow enough so that the first seasteaders are the ones determining their government. Not some people speculating on the Internet.That will be the early adopter advantage.It may change down the road as more people come but those early pioneers will be shaping the foundation of seasteading governance.With just a handful of people all you need are rules akin to a home owners association. They can then decide how they want things from there. Seems legit.I hope we don't have to wait 7 years though.So how do we disrupt the futures market? The way it will be done it will be pretty much impossible to become a dictatorship. That may be the case for some of these mega millions seasteads. At least micro dictatorships.The first seasteads will be more like individuals building a log cabin in the woods. Then more people also building their cabins in nearby woods. Some deciding to be next to each other, some preferring to be on their own. As it grows bigger there will be those that congregate more in one area while others still choose to be far enough away. There will always be the option to be far enough away. That makes it very difficult for a dictatorship to thrive. So more like people choosing to move to Alaska to be free. Without the cold but with other challenges. The mega super structures are a long way from happening and likely slow down seasteading by being the main focus and drain of money that never results in anything being built. When nobody can compile the wallet...I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm sure if you study the protocol updates and implement the changes yourself you could run a node. Or there is likely a way to compile what is on the github page if you can get your environment the exact same way that Craig Wright has his set up so you can compile it. So...definitely possible. This price is shit.
Worrying about the sex or color of those creating a new industry seems a bit short sighted. Not to mention racist and sexist.Those creating a new future are not worried whatsoever about such things, only about those that can actually help make it happen. I stay here in Thailand and become a Buddhist monk. Not for any spiritual reason but so that I can eat. Also with no money I would likely not do so well with the ladies...so at least I would have an excuse.  fml Price is so low it makes me want to move to a floating house in middle of the ocean. Both of my family members who could actually afford to invest have asked me if now is a good time to buy bitcoins. I guess they've sat on the sidelines for long enough that they can finally see a buying opportunity.I usually don't give advice, just tell them what I'm doing. I'm taking my last euros and buying at $3300.I told them they may need to wait until May or June before things start to move upward. I believe Searing's hypothesis about MtGox selling everything before 2019 may be true. Price could continue going down all month.They only need to sell above $1k or so. So buckle up.And then... Why do you think that if people had the option to pay for things on Amazon with bitcoins that they would?Would you? If you can take out a loan on your capital it means you don't have to pay capital gains taxes since you never sold for a profit. May 2019 will be the 12 month countdown to the halving. Still a long way away and we could see other lows before then.  Ironically, it was Deutsche Bank that called the police claiming I was money laundering.This is certainly well deserved.Karma bitches. Price is still so low. 2 more years under $10k.  I think the poor assumption of seasteading is seeing it as a single entity as opposed to a grouping of individuals. Individuals that can move their homes if they don't like their neighbors. Being taken over would be as easy as scooping up oil floating on water with your hand.You should not ask if the seasteaders are protected against torpedos...more importantly would be are those that would torpedo a seastead protected from hundreds of underwater drones equipped with their own torpedos. Ya, I doubt we've seen bottom yet. We've been hoping for the bottom for half a year now.All past bottoms are a quick drop (very low) followed by a quick recovery.Hoping for the bottom is so that you can see light at the end of the tunnel. Right now it's only darkness. They'll get all of these safeguards in place, regulate the exchanges worldwide then....decentralized exchangesoops Yep...I went to their github...downloaded their wallet (which only runs on Linux). Far too many dependencies that I did not have to get the thing to compile. Figured I'd wait for someone to come out with one you don't have to compile on a Linux box.Did Satoshi only run Bitcoin on Linux? I swear reddit has been taken over by legacy finance guys. Nobody has a clue about Bitcoin (or the reason behind it) there.Is this the last place on the Internet where people 'get' Bitcoin?Are we the only ones that will keep the lights on? Do they have a working wallet yet? Looking forward to unloading mine when they do.
I know Joe. It is true that you will pay more than you pay on land just as you do with a boat. But you are likely going to pay less than ocean front property on land and less than a boat. Ya...silly me for asking a boat question on a boat forum.I finally figured out my answer...personal submarineNot really, but eventually. My post on reddit was labeled off topic.I think it is what the new reddit trolls need to see right now. These are the times that try men's souls. I have some euro in a German bank that I've been too lazy to get out.I'll buy bitcoins with them if the price hits $3300. That might give me 2 BTC and I can finally close out that account. There's a reason why at weddings men wear black and women where white.I have the same suit for weddings and funerals. Many similarities in both. *in the US There are cheaper ways of doing this. 4k bitcoin buy wall on Bitfinex at $3,500.All past experience indicates that whoever is trying to drop the price wants it to crash below $3,500.  This is not cool. The only thing we would need government protection from is the government. I'm not disagreeing with the guy. Just kept waiting for the metagame portion that you mentioned.I believe the ideal is that Bitcoin itself is a virus to the king. Slowly consuming until the king (banks) is dead.Strangely enough, this was discussed in some of our seasteading discussions. We don't want to piss off the puppet masters who actually control things (especially early on). So we may have to put a Citibank on one of the first seasteads as an offering to the gods. So in 2014-2015 the price was down from the all time high. The reality is that the price shooting up to $1200 a year after it was about $12 was a bit premature. But the halving dislodged the supply from demand in a way that nobody really knew what to expect since it was completely new to the market. The price came down to more reasonable levels for the amount of bitcoins coming into the market vs the demand.In 2016 there was another halving. This time people anticipated that the price would rise like in 2012 so they began buying. The same thing happened again, the supply and demand were dislodged and people misjudged how that would affect the price. But this time there were some larger investors involved since institutions were able to dip their toes into it. Thus the rise to $20k.The price right now reflects the fact that there are some large institutions with their money in bitcoin but I believe we found the equilibrium of supply and demand around the $6400 range. Though that may have been due to remnants of the FOMO folks still hoping for recovery. Right now people are unreasonably dumping but we still may have some FOMO hold outs that are not yet desperate to leave, so the price may still go down further until they are scared out of the market. Institutions may even start dropping off at times of investor reporting or other institutional reasons. Some may recognize this as a cycle and double down (but don't trust Wall Street folks to be that smart).The key here is that there is not another halving until 2020. So we will be in this price discovery phase for at least a year.If history repeats itself, the few remaining hodlers will desperately be telling people a year from now "the halving is coming...hold on just a little longer!...Please!...". Or, people who saw that the price began to rise a few months before the last halving may start putting their money in a few months before a few months before the halving.Either way, I would say at least until next fall you should not expect to see any decent prices. News, technical advances, etc. never really have any impact on the price (at least in the short term, it just provides fundamentals in the long term).I wish this were not the case as I will be selling seasteads starting next year. Coinciding with a market boom would be ideal. But that's just the reality of how the market reacts to halvings. Then again, who knows...past does not predict future...but we can see some similarities. All good points.Though those born into the system don't really have a choice. I believe the #taxationistheft folks wish that this would become the majority view and the theft fans should be the ones to go and set up elsewhere.I agree, every piece of land is taken by the ass rapists so there is no "if you don't like it just leave".I agree. In time this should provide many of the solutions. I also see seasteading as the solution for those that want to "leave the island". This also we will wait and see. Umm...the guy said a whole lot of nothing with a lot of words.Ending with "if you like what I just said, go to this epsilon site to learn more".The whole article sounded like someone who just learned about Bitcoin and was like "hey guys...I know this Bitcoin thing was made just to get people rich, but have you ever thought that it could be used for liberty?".   2009 called...they want their whole point of Bitcoin's existence back. Strange...in theory it should be 1:1 so what does adding it to the exchange do? Other than allow Bitfinex to fractionally reserve RBTC.I spent some time on Rootstock...never got it to run on my linux box trying to compile from scratch. Admittedly I have Java 10 running and it uses Java 8 so I had to do some editing. I guess it was a bit too reliant on keeping with their set system of compilers. A good year of posts like these should do the trick.Dear n00bs that are in bitcoin to win some big fiat prize...bitcoin is over. Listen to the trolls. You lost your fiat.  I hope your friend "high up" in wall street gets out of bitcoin.He can buy it back when he needs to pay for bread in the bread line. In the end, this is what all liberals (I think they are ok with us calling them what they are now...communists) really want. For everyone to die. Their whole belief system revolves around the craving for death.I'm not sure why, perhaps their life is so miserable that they want to die but just can't bring themselves to kill themselves. So they want a system that makes that happen in a slow and horrible way...but for everyone in the world (because...equality).Also might be why I run into so many transhumanists and people that want to live for hundreds/thousands of years among libertarians. Their belief system revolves around living. Even Hal Finney froze his head in the hopes of being able to fight death. Imagine that there is a small island with many people just living their lives, they have no taxes but they have a wealthy patron that pays for their government. Roads, hospitals, police, etc.His only condition is that he has to have anal sex with everyone on the island at least once a year.This goes on for years, young people are born and when they turn 18 they do their civic duty and provide the guy with their anus for the sex contribution. The guy passes down the tradition to his male children and this goes on for generations. Then the rumblings begin of certain people saying "yearly anal contributions are anal rape!". People justify the anal rape as something that's always been done. "If you don't like it you can just leave", "it's the price we pay for a civilized society!", "what about the roads!?!", "it's only anal rape if the government doesn't spend the money right", "it's not rape because it's legal", "it's not rape if they're gentle", "on my island he takes me to dinner before I am forced to have sex with him so it's not really rape". Everyone justifies anal rape as normal because they don't know any other way of getting government services so they just accept it as normal. People getting anally raped is a normal thing. Because government services.Someone may step forward and say "why don't we just only pay for the services we use? then we could stop being anally raped every year.". After all of the justifications for being raped anally people in the end don't like what the guy is saying mainly because it's easier for them to get anally raped than to pay for things they want. Some even enjoy it so to them it's not rape. Some just can't conceive of how such a system would work so they'd rather just keep getting their ass torn up because it's just how things work. They see him as a threat to their normal way of life and attack him in the hopes that he'll just shut up already.Or worse, some people are exempt and tell the people getting raped that it's their duty ("think of it like paying rent"...even though you're paying my rent too). They even like the system because the people they don't like tend to get raped harder.Then some people may finally say...we'll just create a floating island where we don't have to get anally raped and move there. Instead of people saying "well that's your decision, good luck with that" they are openly hostile to such an idea. "I hope your island sinks!", "you'll end up getting raped by someone even if it's not called rape", "a society without anal rape just can't work", "what about the waves!?!", "Pirates!". Ethereum turned the Bitcoin revolution into the "crypto" revolution.People that couldn't work within the structure of a secure and honest means of transferring value had to go to Ethereum to create shit scams. Then call it "crypto" to act like they're part of Bitcoin.
They don't own all of the water......yet....  Anyone who paid US taxes or used Federal Reserve Notes are complicit in the white phosphorus attacks on innocent women and children. Had a dream that the price was down to $1190.  I decided to go get drunk and the bar was crypto themed.But still under construction.This is Bitcoin right now.  I wish doing text based was still a thing. I created a MUD back in the day (it's actually still running).Graphics could go from simple web app to MMORPG. Ya...would hate to have ideals. Getting bitcoin into the hands of the 1% easiest is to create a specific avenue for only the 1% to buy large quantities...oh but...the bitcoin price! How great it will be!  "you have for the first time in human history an ability to take control of your own life and be a free individual...don't let your greed destroy the finest and greatest opportunity that has yet been offered to mankind"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzJwPd1QkTQ It would help BTC to be rid of people that are out to destroy it.They are better off using their fiat currency and propping up the military industrial complex to help crash the machine quicker. No...in the long run this definitely helps BTC.They need to dump BTC and start using that hashing power for the US military's weapon systems for aiming phosphorous bombs at children. No, you're completely right on most points. A credit card purchase may be "settled" in that price is the same...but the merchant doesn't actually receive the money for a few days. Settling a bitcoin transaction may be faster but the price could change if you're trying to batch several small transactions throughout the day.I think practically a merchant would need to choose a trustworthy or a couple of trustworthy traders (bisq would initially choose the highest rated, highest volume traders). It could almost be just a single trader they work with with the option of choosing another if they're not satisfied.Maybe there could be a way to instantly trade for tethers or some other fiat pegged currency and then have the bisq trader trade the pegged currency for fiat. It's far from over.2019 will be known as the dark year(tm copyright 2018). How to run a con: Step 1. Promise you'll defend free speech. Step 2. Take money from 'investors' (see, e.g., https://www.startengine.com/gab [$1.07M] and https://www.startengine.com/gab-select [$5.67M so far]). Step 3. Ban 'controversial' accounts (to appeal to more investors). Step 4. Who cares? You already got yours. Even better...both sides that are dumping their BTC for this war...don't come back. Thank Allah. But...if the price is crashing so much...what about the tax revenue for the US war machine?Please don't sell at a loss...think of the poor third world children that have never seen the glow of phosphorous before. You can use bisq to send bitcoins and someone there will send fiat to your bank account (or whatever payment method you choose). Just like on localbitcoins.The merchant wouldn't care about what's going on in the background. Someone pays the merchant via BTCPay in bitcoin, the bitcoin is then moved to their bisq wallet (maybe it accumulates to a certain threshold. Then once the threshold is met, it executes a sell order via bisq. The buyer transfers the money and likely the merchant needs to verify with his app that he received the funds.Same as accepting bitcoin, then transferring the BTC to bisq or Localbitcoins and selling it...just in an automated way. Would be better with lightning network due to the amount of transfers.I've personally bought a car by selling bitcoins on localbitcoins and giving the trader the bank account of the guy who sold me the car. Since he was French and I didn't have a french bank account. Should be able to do the same for merchants. Scary thing is...the last dip dropped below the previous ATH.The previous ATH in this case is $1200.Ironically enough I got like 6 job offer e-mails in a row yesterday. Looks like it's time to go back to work. I just need to get good at fishing. And eating fish every day.
Remember who you're selling to (at a discount). I think this has shown that we're going into yet another crypto winter. Last time it was over 2 years.Remember, the last halving was 2016. The price didn't start rising until a few months before the halving.Next halving isn't until 2020. So strap yourselves in...take a break from the bitcoin price...or plan out your next 2 years to gather as much bitcoin as possible.Personally when it did this last time I told my boss that I would take whatever shit job he had anywhere in the world as long as it paid a lot of money. I got a job in Afghanistan and made a lot of money which I poured into bitcoin. Also, google minimalism. Downsize your life to a suitcase. Most don't realize that. Most saw 100% price increase and started thinking "I want a lambo...time to buy some of this bitcoin thing".The reality is...no matter how much things are advancing, less merchants are accepting bitcoin. Mainly thanks to Coinbase dropping their merchant sector and Bitpay switching to BCH.The whole point of bitcoin is slowly degrading. I used to be able to live on bitcoin. Now I'm paying for hotels online with a credit card. Google minimalism. Has there been any work done on integrating BTCPay with bisq?I realize bisq has low volume right now but...If a business could set up BTCPay with bisq running where they can accept bitcoin and receive fiat in their bank account without really needing to know anything about Bitcoin then it would become the best payment solution.It could also work the other way around. "My company now accepts all currencies around the world" with the ability in each country to deposit funds. The merchant could then either get paid in BTC or take it a step further and convert it back to their own currency in their account.The money to be made on this would be having companies that will host this for people...while the option is still there for companies to set it up on their own server.I've only downloaded either one so I'm not sure of the development going on. This.LN requires that nodes have their bitcoins in a hot wallet.Good luck convincing a bank to set up a huge centralized node with millions of dollars sitting in a hot wallet.No, seriously...good luck. I don't know anything about hacking but that might just motivate me to open up a hacking book so I can get my hands on that hot wallet.  I was heavily involved in trying to get Ron Paul elected in 2008 which involved keeping up to date on most things going on on Ron Paul Forums.After the 2008 elections we moved forward with the liberty movement (which was usurped by the corporate Tea Party) and kept each other informed on various projects related to liberty and freedom. Bitcoin was mentioned early on, then mentioned more. I'd been a big gold bug and had always tried to figure out how to convert all of my money into gold while still being able to spend it. I figured if I could at least demonstrate how one person can do it, then it would allow others to do the same. Problem was that gold requires storage which costs money. Any gold credit/debit card charged a fee per use and a monthly storage fee.When someone first mentioned bitcoin and speculated that in the future we would use a basket of currencies as our every day currencies I pushed back because I felt that gold was the answer to future currencies. But after I saw that bitcoin hit dollar parity I downloaded the wallet. It had a button you could click to start mining so I tried to mine. It crashed my computer so I was like...screw Bitcoin, this thing sucks. And went on with my life.Then I read about the jump from $2 to $32 and I decided it was time to get in. When it came back down to $17 I cashed out my Roth IRA and bought $10k worth (as it spent 2 years slowly falling down to $2). I sold it all when it came back up to $12. You imply that it is not fair to receive benefits without paying in.A charity provides benefits to people without expecting anything in return.Government spends. That is their choice. They don't have to. But they choose to.That is completely unrelated to them stealing peoples' money. If someone voluntarily donated all of their money to the government so that they would have the same amount of money as taxes they would spend it just the same. If a country bought a shitload of bitcoin at $1 and now has enough to for spending for the next 100 years they would spend it. It would not be expected that the people "pay them back" out of "fairness".Or, when you give to charity, are you expecting to be compensated by the charity at some point? But you would at least have a choice in what you're paying for.I do not see much value in my contributions toward phosphorous bombing women and children in some far off place. Not Blue Frontiers related but for those that are willing to buy an actual seastead, let me know via PM.*not looking for investors, just neighbors* Is it fair if someone takes food from a church that is feeding people...and then they never give anything to the church?How many people in countries that the US gives foreign aid to are paying US taxes? You know what happens when you're caught on the wrong side of history?Nothing...you're dead. Doesn't matter to you by then. Don't worry about what future historians will say, they're likely to be ignorant twats. Price is so low I have to watch the Bitfinex price instead of Bitstamp. Complete speculation but...I believe that Craig Wright signed a very large monetary deal with some investors after giving them the impression that he was Satoshi and that he could not release his BTC until 2020.Whatever deal this is, he is desperate to get as many bitcoins as he can before then. He tried to make BCH the "real bitcoin" but that didn't work...so now just make up some fear about Segwit the he will "reveal in 2019" to drive down the price so he can get as many coins as possible to fulfill his part of the deal. Looks like he needs the price to drop to around $1k to be able to pull that off. Not going to happen. True story.But most people don't know the definition of extortion. My gf sells on localbitcoins.The past couple of days she's had some big sales requested.I told her to ignore them.Not taking the chance of the price shooting back up right after she's done a sale. Yep...it would be...get in, get my BTC out and be done I gave it a half assed try to convert my 1 BCH I pulled off of Coinbase a few days ago into the forked coins.BSV wallet is only linux based, I downloaded and tried to run it but I got tired of installing missing libraries so...no free BSV coins for me while they have any value.Didn't get a chance to try to get BAB.This one will have to sit with the others that are slowly losing value as well.If a software engineer isn't getting your wallet to work, you haven't planned things all that well. (not saying it can't be done...just don't feel like going through the hassle that it would have taken). This is it. Instead of cashing out later you should cash out now.You tried to get rich. It just didn't work out.Time for you to look for something else.
Well, looks like Poloniex has 3 BCH coins that add up to about .15 BTC. Best I've seen in a while. Time to start selling.Edit: Oh shit BCH SV wallet is linux only at this point and it looks like maybe I have to compile it.I usually have a shit time getting wallets to run on my linux setup because I don't have a desktop, only ssh. So has it split yet? Where can I sell cash abc and cash sv for bitcoins? Obamacare is a tax on being alive.You no longer have a choice of not paying taxes by not earning income. This time I had to pull out some this is the end shit..."there were fatalities"  Ok, this is not funny anymore.  Hopefully there is someone with localbitcoins nearby. I have banks in the US but overseas I live off of mainly localbitcoins/cash and online bitcoin purchases.If you're in the US you can use gyft.com and egifter.com for hundreds of stores. Including Walmart for food and gas. Yes, at least some proof of residency.I always have a hard time with addresses when someone asks for one. Are you sending me something? Is it official? Which government is it officially for? Is it for tax purposes (TX address vs IN address), etc.As someone said in line here in Malaysia when applying for a Thai visa..."we need world passports" (for those of us that just live in the world). Well the idea was that your game only lasts a month or so. At the end of the cycle you collect your winnings or losses and that's it. Find a new game. As a world traveler I was able to keep my bitcoins on Bitfinex even though they didn't allow US users.The requirements by exchanges and the regulations they're trying to avoid revolve around US residents, not US citizens.If he is outside of the US long enough and stays in one place long enough he can establish residency outside of the US and be fine.  So...umm...I was told November was the month where Bitcoin historically rises the most.Something about everyone getting together on Thanksgiving to get their family members to buy BTC. Boomer? I think that's my parent's generation.What if winning is being able to act as a solitary individual and not be sucked into some collective?As you point out...collectivism is for the weak. Because you can't survive on your own without your group. Not to agree with you at all but...I used to be admin on a website that was shut down by AIPAC.The Obama Forums...We may have taken the satire (trolling) a bit too far for the Internet at the time. Actually...just about anything said on the Internet these days is taking things too far. Hmm. If he's not then he's doing it wrong.Just gave me a great idea.1. Create troll account.2. Spit out garbage troll stuff via a script (maybe even steal random stuff from troll websites like stromfront).3. Rack up a shit ton of posts.4. Signature campaign.5. Profit. I think eventually alts will lose value faster than the time it takes to download the miner. <img>What if I told you jpg</img>That everyone who wants to manipulate a bunch of people to attack their enemy must first convince people that their enemy is not human.It has happened throughout history with every culture that has gone to war.Guess what? All humans are humans. Even <insert your leader's enemy here> Bitcoins mined by CPU may take about 100 years of game play for them to mine $1 worth. I logged into Coinbase and noticed that I have about 1 BCH on there. So I took it off and put it into a paper wallet. I will play around with my 1 BCH after the split and see what I can get out of it. Actually I might read it. I have been reading several books that had a huge impact on the world just so that I understand the source as opposed to what I am told.I read Nietzche's Will To Power because it was said that Hitler based much of his philosophy on it. I wanted to see what kind of book could spark such devastation.I'm currently reading the Bible. So far I am learning that many people manipulate the stories that are actually told in it to their own end.Mein Kampf may be a good one to read as well. I would also like to read historically significant books from other cultures, understanding that western history was not the only one.As for the price of a seastead? We're looking to have the price near the equivalent of a single family home in the US. Cheaper per sqm than a boat but more expensive per sqm than on land.
 BTC crashing hard.Was going to mention a huge buy wall at $6300 (usually a downward indicator) but forgot.So ends bitcoin.Was roach right all along? Time to read Mein Kempf? Bitcoin volatility index down to 1.03%.It hasn't been this low in over 2 years. How does voting help? I currently play a game called Call Of War where you play a month (or two!) campaign to take over the world.They have multiple games available to start each week but once you get started everyone is in that game for a while.It would be a lot easier to only use currencies that implement the Lightning Network. There there's no reason to store coins on some central server.I too would love it if the currency of a game was bitcoin over the lightning network. Should be easy enough to implement. Marx doesn't believe in working for your capital. The state shall provide. When I was in Saigon there was free market enterprise just about anywhere (apparently the government didn't regulate the shit out of everything). There was no storefront that you passed that didn't have a business.One old lady literally only had a pot and a bunson burner with a couple of very small plastic tables and chairs.She cooked an amazing meal on the street corner for very cheap (about $2 for a meal that filled me up).If you think you need someone else in order to have a job to live, you're doing it wrong. You don't have to work for someone else to eat though. You can work for yourself. And you have choices of who to work for and for how much. Taxation does not leave that choice. Had an idea for a video game.Basically like an RPG battle type of system where everyone chooses their race (elf, dwarf, human, orc, etc.) which each have their own abilities, weapons, armor, etc. They're all at war with each other. They also all have their own currencies. And those currencies are cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, Monero, ETH, etc.). Everyone pays like $1 worth of their currency at the beginning of the game cycle (like a month or so). You create a character and level up, etc. within your tribe. Your currency fluctuates during that time which may give you access to better weapons if your currency does well or you'll struggle if the price goes down.You battle other races and can get their money/weapons if you kill someone. At the end you get to keep what you gained during the cycle (minus a cut for the game developer).If all the crypto prices stay the same then all races would have equal chances of winning outside of some playability of the players. This would have people rooting for their particular currency throughout that month watching the price even when they're not playing.Thoughts?  I bought some bitcoin over spot price but the guy assured me it was purchased before the BCH split so I'm now sitting on these pre-fork coins. Totally going to take advantage of the split. So...the price is terrifyingly low. Why and who?Fix it now.Get that shit back up over $10k already. ^ +1 Merit Jay has himself on ignore. Legally not considered theft...but if it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck...it's likely a duck. If someone takes money by force...that would be theft.Image if George and Jim both independently take money from someone at gunpoint in the street. George then takes the money and goes buys some cigarettes and booze. Jim takes the money and puts it toward setting up an educational foundation supporting underprivileged children.Which one stole the money?  Just remember...when selling you get hit with tax consequences (in the US).So selling a big chunk is not the best strategy (unless you're just in it for the fiat and supporting your benevolent government with more money).Personally I was able to retire and I can pull out $35k of my bitcoin every year tax free. I don't have to work the rest of my life.To me that seemed a bit more important than anything I could cash out and buy.  Interest on the debt is now the #4 spending item (behind Elderly Welfare, Poor Healthcare and National Offense).So ya...they steal your money to pay interest on the ever growing debt. Eventually all of your taxes will be going toward just paying interest.But that has nothing to do with the question of the actual act of taxation being theft or not. If you ever had a Bitcoin address associated with your account you can always sign a message with that key as proof. Maybe I missed it...what does ABC refer to wrt BCH?
I wonder if people will use their mobile wallets to pay for this...Using that thing they have in their pocket all the time...That displays the time... Stop trying to screw Thai people over with your shitcoins.You are on par with Bitconnect who scammed way too many Thais.Just buy and hold bitcoin. Eventually you'll be able to spend bitcoin all over Thailand.You will eventually start seeing 2 lines through that 'B' all over the country. Bureaucrats are all like "hrm...let's plan out this crypto thing, set up committees vote on legislation, approve amendments, herdy derdy derp..."then technology like bisq comes along and shits all over their plans  The less Washington accomplishes the better. Gridlock is always good.Unless you like government getting bigger. Wex.nz is formerly btc-e which was raided by US stazi and many bitcoins were stolen.They re-opened as wex.nz with the promise that they would get everyone their coins over time. They created a token in place of your actual coins so that you could trade those with the promise that within 2 years (1 year from now) they would reimburse 100% of the coins tokens held.Since they didn't have many of the actual coins they shut off withdrawals. But they allowed you to withdraw a few coins. One being namecoin. People with money on wex who want to get it off bought NMC so they could take it off the exchange and then sell it elsewhere.This lead to a huge rise in price on wex of NMC and a huge crash in price everywhere else. Slightly difficult for Germans to invest. Though with SEPA they can use the european exchanges.No localbitcoin though. When I was there selling on LBC it was mainly middle aged guys buying. A few because they didn't like their government tracking all of their transactions. One or two I am fairly certain needed it for their habit. But most were just regular dudes. Not many young though.Also...German Nazi Polizei suck donkey balls. In case any are reading this. Why is the state required for medicine?Have these not been private enterprises for centuries? Labor is voluntary. Taxes are not voluntary.Instead of capital...what other means of exchange would you rather be used for trade? If you trade capital...then you too are a capitalist.So tired of these communist (sorry, I mean socialist...sorry, I mean democratic fascists...err socialists)/progressives hypocritically using capital as a means of trade while bashing capitalism.*hint: that last part is sarcasm for all the people that complain about libertarians using government services (even though we have no alternative...by force) while complaining about taxes Bitcoin Volatility Index has been stable for the past week around 1.41-1.45%...Low volatility on the volatility.The uptrend usually builds from the lowest volatility (under 1%). All of those "get rich quick" n00bs have taken their candy and gone home. Not worth buying bitcoins with their credit cards anymore. If the FOMO crowd is gone and price is still stable that means there is a steady flow of money coming in to counter the miners producing BTC. That means that in less than 2 years when the halving hits, the price has to go up. Enough people realize this and start buying before the halving. By the time the halving happens the change is already priced in (unless the effect is over/under estimated).  Frankfurt orgies are not a big event. Just head on down to the FKK. Speaking of...now that I'm in a country that has a bitcoin exchange I need to stop being lazy and figure out how to live off of bitcoin again. I've been just selling through my gf who sells on localbitcoins so we just use cash.But I'm finally living somewhere with an address and online shopping so it's time to get back to it.When I was in Germany I bought my groceries (including fresh meat and produce) on Amazon. Living in such a small country their shipping is next day for everything. This is the second time I've seen this this week.Where are these horrible places where hospitals are built by governments? Hmm...bcash is up but not enough for me to pull out my cold storage.I only did a few at .2 BTC...it's less than .1 For most alcoholics...the answer is usually zero.I attended a few AA meetings with her. One guy mentioned that his girlfriend said that the day before she bought a six pack of beer, had 2 then went to sleep.He was like....what about the other 4!?! I doubt much experimentation could be done on land under most governments of the world. That's why I see seasteading as a necessary step between here and there.There are several promising technologies, no magic bullet but it may be a combination of several things. Likely tailored to the individual.I don't follow it close enough to know the tech (yet) but I believe it will be something available to only the super rich early on (like most new tech), so part of my hodl strategy involves saving for that tech instead of blowing it on lambos now.Recently I have been given a peek into just how much Bitcoin will benefit the world. The early adopters of Bitcoin are the same ones that believe in this tech and the reason behind it. They are now very rich and have different dreams than the rich that came before us. Very interesting times ahead. I was married to an alcoholic and the best explanation I found for it was this...When you drink you're essentially drinking a poison. The first few times your body is like 'WTF?' and you puke and feel miserable the next day. Your body continues to fight it for a while but if you're drinking large amounts of alcohol before you're 25 or so while your body is still developing (the earlier, the worse) your body is like 'ok, I guess this is a thing that is necessary'. So your body begins to adapt. It changes your chemistry so that drinking alcohol is part of what you do, it eventually gets to the point where it is something your body needs.It is at this point that you are an alcoholic. When you go without alcohol your body starts to crave it, as though you are going without water. If you go too long without it you start to get angry for no reason, you convince yourself that having a drink is ok. Your body needs the alcohol.I can't say what the way forward is because your body chemistry is already altered. I am not sure if stopping drinking will change it back...if you're much older it may take years. For my wife it just got worse and worse...she eventually passed away partly due to the drinking (and trying to use prescriptions to counter some of the problems brought on by drinking). Personally I have stopped almost completely. Not because I was addicted but I have realized that I may be rich enough in my old age to be able to afford the life extension treatments that most will not have access to. But I don't want to be old and falling apart when that happens so I'm trying to choose a healthy lifestyle. Alcohol adds nothing positive to your body and for me was always something I used as a crutch to socialize better. But fuck that, I'd rather live for 100s of years than be the life of the party. Most towns I lived in in the US had private garbage service. If you didn't like your garbage service you just canceled and went with another one. The Bitcoin dev slack channel.Maybe you can convince them all to turn off Bitcoin and replace it with a big advertisement for heavy, difficult to secure, metals. 
Where I used to live in the US only 1 out of 3 of those is paid by the government.Taxation is a form of raising money if you're not smart enough to come up with something better. It's lazy governance that is only allowed because people accept it as necessary.I just don't like it when people go the store and have the choice of a variety of goods which they pay for with the money they earn and they still don't want capitalism. Myeong Donghttps://goo.gl/9FQyQnKnew it looked familiar. Been there. My first guess is Seoul...Gangnam...looks familiar. Hard to keep up with that religion. They keep changing the words. Ya, I really wanted them to go ahead with the main sale. They decided that since it would be a while before they had anything concrete in French Polynesia it was disingenuous to move ahead with the sale. You'd basically be buying tokens that may never be used. But they're still working on getting things going. I visited the atoll they're considering and it's perfect for a seastead.They're still distributing varyon. It's just not currently tied to anything since they don't have a location to build anything. If you have a Bitcoin address linked to your account you can send Theymos a signed message from that address. Worshiping at the alter of central governments...the new religion. Ya...when I lived in Florida I became so frustrated that I figured I would never buy another boat with just one motor. I finally just gave up and bought a kayak. My favorite boat of them all. I'm pretty sure that would not be allowed.I don't know the exact wording. Probably something like "by order of the king, no jet skis are allowed within 10 nautical miles of national parks...due to reasons". Way off topic but maybe Ibian or any other boat owners will know the answer...I will be living on a seastead in a few months...about 15nm out to sea. The water is relatively calm here (mean wave height of about 1-2 feet). But of course throughout the year it could get up to 6-7 feet. The seastead design is capable of handling 15 feet waves so no problem.My question is about my commuter boat. I just had to take Jet Ski off of my potential boats list because it is not allowed on the nearest island (where I would go to grab groceries and grab a bite).I'm leaning toward a whaly dinghy like this:This would be good because I could pull the outboard and hang that from the side of the seastead (likely could not keep a whole boat out of the water unless it is super light) and the boat could bounce around in any storm and be fine, even flipped upside down.The worry I have is the ride on the open sea in a dinghy. I've been in a small dinghy in about 2-3 foot waves and it would not be a pleasant drive for 15 nm.I could get something bigger I think I need to keep the criteria that the boat can flip over and not be that bad off (like if I wait until morning to come out and flip it back over).I will have 3 mooring balls around the seastead far enough away for about a 20-30 foot boat.Any suggestions?I asked this on a boater forum only to be attacked for the concept of seasteading and the whole "you're gonna die!! zOMGz!! or <insert seastead jokes here>". No constructive assistance at all. The seastead builder is suggesting I just get a big boat...that it won't flip.And no...there are no hurricanes/typhoons here. Why is the EU trying to prevent the airplanes of one nation entering its countries? Perhaps more countries should refuse to fly there if they are excluding national aviation authorities. Such sanctions should not be tolerated internationally. NVM...price back up $3. Bear market is over. Moon? Price is down $3...can anyone explain this move? Any walls observed for such a huge change in price? Volatility index is currently at 1.4%. In 2015 and 2016 it got down to .8% before the price started moving upward. I think if we keep similar prices for another week we will see close to 0% volatility over 30 days. October 3rd we were at around $6400. Overpopulation...on land... That's just funny right there. I don't care who you are. Thanks for the hat.I was at dinner tonight with someone from europe and someone from thailand.When referring to the price of something I used the price in bitcoin and everyone was able to understand easier than had I converted it to one of our home currencies. Awesome. Thank you for actually doing work on Namecoin.Very cool. I added the plugin to my chrome browser and finally got to my first .bit website (http://nayuki.bit).Chrome plugin:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dotbitme-bit-web-surfer/kkjfoinnbmgmjgmiakbbhggdmccbjhga?hl=enAs for the price on WEX...I had 21k NMC on there which they were likely using to allow withdrawals in NMC. I finally got my account back and took 14k NMC off of there so their supply went down quite a bit. I still bave 7k NMEC which is losing value (also likely due to more limited supply). In theory they are supposed to convert NMEC to NMC next year at full value. Not in your safe, not your gold. Still have the twitter page:https://twitter.com/BitPoolsAnd yes, Blue Frontiers is not going forward with the main sale unfortunately. French Polynesia is dragging their feet on giving us a location.In the mean time I've moved onto another project with a smaller team building something here in Thailand. It's almost done and we plan on having something in the water in January.No need for investors as we are all early adopters.We will be selling these things once we've proven that they are safe. Not publicizing anything due to lessons learned in Tahiti. The only people we care to give information to are those that actually want to have their own seastead.
There won't be any spam attacks on the mempool until Bitcoin Ultra Super chain is proposed with major extra turbo block size. If it helps the euphemism...it was some spicy Thai soup. Meh, I would consider it. I dropped my phone in soup and ever since it randomly complains about moisture in the USB port. Very annoying as it randomly won't let me charge it.The separate location for wallets is ok. Breadwallet does this but breadwallet doesn't let you set your transaction fee. Not sure about Theymos but I will likely be living on a seastead in the next 3 months or so. So the latest update is that Blue Frontiers will not be moving ahead with the main sale. All pre-sale purchases are being refunded and varyon is still being issued with no obligations to Blue Frontiers.The timing was just not right, the bear market plus French Polynesia taking their own sweet time to get a site approved just makes it so that moving forward with the main sale right now just doesn't make sense. Blue Frontiers is still moving forward, they're working on obtaining funding through more traditional means and narrowing their focus down to utilize the work they have already put in, mainly focusing on the sea zone and regulation side of things. The $100k contest to find a suitable seasteading location is still moving forward with about a dozen contestants moving into the second round with locations all over the world. Hopefully the timing of having several locations along with the market swinging back upward will allow for a future sale but that may not be necessary. So basically a whale or company that did not want to take the risk is pulling their money out of BFX the only way they can...through BTC.Now that same risk adverse whale or company will want to convert back to their precious safe fiat currency on another exchange. Sure they lose money but have less risk. Which also drives the price down on that other exchange. There is likely some network connectivity out there. Then I go check out the nearest island to see what's available for those wanting to go grab a bite to eat or re-supply.Definitely no fees. Separate from Blue Frontiers' project. Hopefully staying under the radar, learning from BF's mistake of thinking that if you try to inform the public they won't still shit all over it because "freedom is scary". So...ya...this is all natural.Tomorrow I go out into the ocean to scout a seasteading site so I'll be missing all of the action. Free Hat! "block"folio"crypto"  Bitcoin is crashing. We're all going to die. Time to start acquiring a taste for canned dog food. Practice this phrase: "do you want fries with that?". Oyster & Chop. Auckland.  Tried but failed.  Was Satoshi's vision flawed? Is the chain of blocks coming to an end? You guys...I'm scared.Just checked the price and we're under $10k.    Same tends to happen with gold. A huge drop in the stock market has an immediate affect dropping gold as well. But over the long term it rises due to a bad stock market.Also...this is why we don't want to attach BTC to Wall Street. True. If you're retired and have nothing better to spend your money on then a lambo is a good way to burn through some cash.But if you're still working and buy a lambo...you just extended your working days by the amount you have to earn to pay for that thing (which would be the opposite of fun). Unless you enjoy your work. Buying a lambo is like buying a shitcoin that you can show off. They both lose value at about the same rate. It's not that they're not allowed, it's just the amount of BS you have to go through with the SEC is not worth it for a startup. There are several different approaches, the best one being that you can raise up to $5 million a year from non-accredited US investors.The US makes it so anyone who is not rich already cannot invest in something that may make them rich. Because grandma is stupid. If she invests in something and loses her money she calls her congressman to complain. So he writes a law so no more grannies can invest their money. Problem solved.Thank your masters for protecting you from yourself. This should be: "who doth control English?"Please stop messing up my language, of which I control. I have a team of grammar nazis that enforce my rule. I've been to Vietnam "carrying" over $1 million in bitcoin. No questions asked. They have a bitcoin ATM at a pizza place. You just grab a pizza while you wait for your transaction to go through and get your dong.
Guys, I'm scared. It's still under $10k.  Looks like we're going down to $6450. Then back up to $6525. Then down to $6460. And up to $6515...and on and on... Bitcoin volatility index is crashing hard.Is this the end for the media's volatility excuse?Volatility index currently at the lowest it's been in over a year at 2.5%.Price started rising last time after the price was soooo boring for about a month and the index was at .8%. In the early days when the price went up over $200 I started putting some of my coins into alts (LTC, NMC, PPC). Then I realized...I could write a program to make alt coins and just spit them out at a high rate, like 10, 100, 1000 per day. I even considered creating a simple website with a simple form (name of coin, how many, how many pre-mined, mining type, etc.) and just charge BTC for each one. It would then send you the code and executables.This realization made me seriously reconsider investing in any more alts. When alts can be printed as fast as the Federal Reserve prints new dollars then it's a horrible investment. wtf is this shit? You can use my cryptocurrency but you have to follow the compliance controls to ensure the US government can track your every move. But it's so much better because your dollars are now digital! And centralized! And not really a cryptocurrency. And not really a currency. Ya, I thought the Wine Galleria sign would have thrown people off while I cropped the coffee part out. Well done.I had seen a picture of that Bitcoin Box sign before when I was in Tahiti. Looked for what it was and found out that it was a defunct exchange. I was thinking that restaurant had some sort of bitcoin thing going on but it's just an advertisement. Wow, that was quick. I wasn't sure if I made it too easy or not. I thought I would be able to fool people as I panned out to the Korean restaurant (with Chinese on the sign). Ok, I'll give a crack at the Wall Observer Thread image challenge. Price is down to unprecedented* levels.It was nice knowing you all, we will never forget this crazy experiment that we were all a part of.*in terms of the past few minutes/seconds Response from RapidzPay (the company the articles mentioned would be handling the crypto payments):"Major Cineplex has previously announced that it is ready to accept cryptocurrency payments. As of current, it is not accepting cryptocurrency payments yet. Hope this answers your question."As for using fiat for a movie? How boring.  You can just admit that you're drinking a glass of straight vodka. No need to call it a martini to sounds like you're 007. I seriously had to check the calendar to see what month it is right now.Perhaps it's because I'm on Thailand time which starts a bit sooner than most of the rest of the world but I am showing that September 1st has passed already. Speaking of price trackers...does anyone know of a good list of the main exchanges for every country? Best I could find so far is https://coinpedia.org/exchange/ and a few sites that charge money to access their list. "Despite the risks associated with digital assets, Mr Billingslea said they also presented a great opportunity. In terms of regulation"In other words, "We can use the blockchain to track everything!"Anti-Money Laundering. Because if the government can't track your every penny, you must be a criminal."but if you're not doing anything wrong, you shouldn't mind relocating to the ghetto for your protection" I think we already saw it at $6800. I'm fearful of such a low bitcoin price because I'm greedy. Has anyone used BTC to pay for a movie at Major Cineplex? I downloaded their app and didn't see the option.Does it work if you go to the theater? So...higher number is less fear? Guys why is the price so low?Still under $10k.  Do they still have that Bitcoin store in Prague?We should theme these picture locations to Bitcoin related sites  
The idea I was toying with was sort of like a decentralized reputation system. You might have a json file with a few commonly agreed upon fields likeName: HairyMaclairyType: <bitcoin sales>Rating: 1/10Description: "The dude stiffed me"Evidence: <screenshot.jpg>Hash that, put the hash on the blockchain and send the small amount of data to the decentralized hosts. You have a copy so no worries if everyone drops it, you put it back out there. Over time you may no longer feel the need to keep the review out there and just stop paying. Or someone who really loves the reputation system (or figures out a way to profit from it) can host all of the data, forever archived.The key being, no centralized system can censor it.Name: AWSType: <hosting service>Rating: 0/10Description: "AWS sucks!"Evidence: "word.doc""Cannot find file you were searching for on AWS called 'AWS_sucks.txt'".Also by having it decentralized, you can just create a reputation system software program that you just fill out the form then set up an auto pay or pay up front for X amount of months. Paying 1 satoshi/Mb per day you could keep such a small message online for years with just a few bits.The software could also rate providers by up time and prioritize using their services. Requiring each user to create their own AWS or hosting service adds complexity to the whole process that most people wouldn't endure.This could also be used for a decentralized turing complete program allowing for some decentralized apps without using alt coins. Decentralized web site, javascript, etc.At one point I had an idea for selling wall mounted bitcoin price trackers. I considered creating a web page that the tracker referenced to display the price but was worried about someone hacking the page and now everyone that had my product on their wall was now displaying something else. I looked for a way to do a decentralized web page to be displayed that could be updated and changed only by someone with the private key but could not find anything (other than promises by shitcoins). Hilarious.Look at how many people were schooled on the fact that someone is willing to voluntarily pay money to express their distaste for being forced to hand over their own money.Bitcoin user not affected. Seems legit. I'm sure he'd appreciate that someone is thinking about him in these trying times. Meh, I wasn't thinking much as far as privacy. More akin to decentralized, reliably hosted torrents. But if you had enough "seeders" you could ensure some reliability. I found blockstack which allows for a lot of interesting things in a decentralized way but you have to host your own data or host it on a website. This approach could add that last leg of true decentralization. I thought Storj was trying to do this on Bitcoin but they ended up doing like so many other decent Bitcoin projects and ended up creating a shitcoin so they could get rich on an ICO. Have there been any projects working toward combining lightning and hosting data/bandwidth? Like "pay me 1 satoshi/Mb per day or I drop your data".I invested in Maidsafe about a thousand years ago. They promised something like that. Now with LN, I think it could be possible to do with BTC (save the hash of the data on the blockchain, or OP_RETURN, and have the data hosted on several LN nodes for cheap).  Price down. This is the end. Still under $10k. There's an ETF rejection date coming September 21st so the Wall Street folks are ignorantly hedging for a Bitcoin ETF. Umm...you're on the WO thread reading posts by bears in a forest filled with bears...You're just asking to be attacked by bears. Everywhere. I was off on a remote island for a week with no Internet. I come back to the WO thread and see talk about bcash?It's trading less than .07 BTC now. That's less than bgold was trading after the value dropped.How much discussion was there in this thread about bgold?Let it go. They tried, it failed. Bring on the next big block size coin to get people excited about. Definitely still going. The main sale is being planned for October. Several announcements coming soon. Price dropping due to Wall Street not participating in Bitcoin is great.People selling still believe in the legacy system.They will buy back when they need BTC to pay for bread in the bread line. Word is out that Bitcoin will suffer in the long run under ETF approval.Rejections are good for Bitcoin.I feel dirty that I told the SEC that they should approve the ETF in order to stay relevant. I really don't want them to stay relevant. $26.5 trillion in offshore money...when Bitcoin is much easier than dealing with all of that 2 days until the ProShares ETF is rejected.Not your keys. Not your bitcoins. California...it figures.Dude won't get fair treatment. Looks like he was selling BTC on localbitcoins and made about $37k which puts him about at the lowest tax bracket so at least he doesn't need to worry about a capital gains tax violation.He was selling in California, sending the money to Bitfinex and converting back to BTC. For this they considered it "International Money Laundering".Them throwing out numbers like $750k, $1 million, etc. is all bullshit. They even said he did 971 separate transactions. That's less than $800 per sale on average.The judge even threw in his general disdain for US laws as a reason to not give him bail. Ya think?I guess we all need to start acting all super patriotic and love the nazi laws publicly so that when they try to throw us in jail because we're "required to register with the Department of Treasury" for our bitcoin transactions we can get bail.All future posts by me will be super patriotic and utter bullshit. I expect I may need to return to the US at some point for funerals and such so I must act like a Jew in Nazi Germany or a proletariat in the Soviet Union. God Bless the USA! The price moves in the direction of the walls. From what I've seen discussed about Venezuela's cryptocurrency is it's a cryptocurrency in name only.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_(cryptocurrency)Crypto on NEM that is supposedly set to the price of a barrel of oil. Meh, gf sells BTC on localbitcoins. Nigerian scammer took some old woman's money by "making her" send money 17 times to 10 different bank accounts (LBC users). My gf was one of those LBC users. The police flagged all of the accounts until they could figure out what happened. They finally cleared her but the bank still has her account locked.For mine...it's been a long time issue with Germany's screwed up system. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BdO396PIZw Here it is, Sunday night in Tahiti. What does one do with your time in such a paradise?My gf and I are literally both calling our banks to get our accounts unlocked due to bitcoin.Her calling Thailand, me calling Germany. Via Skype, in French Polynesia.Such is the life of a bitcoin hodler.I just want to get my money out of my German bank into BTC so I can close the account.
I'd say that a strong minority among right wingers are closet homosexuals. Like so far in the closet that they want to pass laws to control their own urges. I can see Andreas's explanation that an ETF is bad for Bitcoin.The premise being that the ETF holding company would be in possession of a huge amount of bitcoins, which would make them a big decision maker when it comes time for things like forks and such. Exchanges already hold a large amount of sway because of this. An ETF would just add to this.And of course, his final point was "not your keys, not your bitcoins". Never forget. I went to one in Germany where it's a circle with several urinals pointing inward. I think the center fills with pee and then...profit??But when I got there it was full to the point where you're filling up the basin and it runs down to the ground.I pissed anyway because that was an acceptable place to publicly pee and I had to go. If millions are killed each month/week then I think people might finally realize it's not a good thing.And then there will be the holdouts that claim "but that's not real socialism!". First thing I checked. Also likely the amount of times millions must be killed by socialism for people to learn that socialism is kinda bad. No. Not bitcoin.de.My German bank account has been frozen to international transfers (likely because I connected to the server from my current country, French Polynesia, trying to transfer all of my funds out). I no longer live in Germany . They want me to come in and verify whatever bullshit they need to unlock it.So I am interested in buying bitcoins from someone with a German bank account.Let me know. Thank you.About 6k euro. How many times does the tragedy of the commons need to be demonstrated? Poop on the public streets is a symptom of public streets.Privatize it all and you won't have people pooping on other peoples' private property. And if they do, the owner cleans it up. If the owner has to clean up enough poop...they eventually realize that having a toilet is easier.In Germany they usually charge about 1 euro to use the toilet. They are very clean and well maintained.Everyone in Germany knows to keep a few euros on hand in case you need to use a toilet. *beep* *oop* *burp**I am a robot**tax is not theft it is your civic responsibility**end of transmission**derp* *fap* *boop* I had that exact thing happen to me due to depositing 30k euro over the course of a year, transferring it to a bitcoin exchange. *beep* *oop* *burp**I am a robot**tax is not theft if money is spent right**end of transmission**derp* *fap* *boop* Room 77, Berlin Bots and arbitrage. 10 print people who can do Basic20 goto 10 Any chain that's not backed by an underlying asset is prone to attack. At least, less secure than bitcoin.Going off chain or creating a new shitcoin or using ETH tokens is easy. But not the best solution. Well, the channel needs to be opened. When a channel is opened the two/three nodes know the public keys of who is opening them. Once the channels are open all transactions are anonymous (you don't know if coins coming from your neighbor node are originally from him or passed to him from someone else).I think the key would be to find a way of restricting the opening of channels from addresses that aren't colored. And somehow restricting the amount (to prevent someone from just adding X bitcoins that aren't colored).Still need to check into the way others have approached it. Finally after 2 years of trying to get back into my account I was able to get my NMC out. Well, about 60% of them. The rest are in NMC tokens.They unlocked my account and gave me 2 weeks. Then opened up withdrawals. I pulled out all the NMC I had on there.Wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to take a 25% cut on the final bit of NMC or not. Waiting things out to see what develops. For me it has been a way to live anywhere in the world without the need of a bank account. Especially since most foreign banks hate Americans. I for one welcome all drunken stoned spambots.
Well, according to mymenace 5/6 of my posts are shitposts.So...either this post is a shitpost or my last one was.Statistically it is likely that both were. Very positive.Weak hands + Darwin = less weak hands Code:Last of the V8s Just like when the US bombs women and children in Iraq it's not murder because it's legal. I have not heard about that discussion about black listing.I see it more as being able to represent something other than bitcoin and LN being used for easy transfers. The idea I had specifically was a fiat pegged crypto using Bitcoin which would allow for easy exchange from fiat to BTC.I see the creation of Ethereum and new chains to represent something that can be done on the most secure blockchain (Bitcoin) as a lazy approach which lacks imagination and ingenuity.I would rather not have any central authority but rather a protocol that is accepted via consensus much like TCP/IP and other protocols. yw  On a positive note, WEX finally allowed me to withdraw my NMC. Well, about 2/3rds of my coins. The rest are in their own NMC token. The token is supposed to be bought back within 2 years of issue. So I get to decide to lose 2k NMC now and get 6k out. Or take a chance and wait until next year to see if they're still viable.Actually, NMC token is going to be the hottest new thing. Anyone want to buy some? Get in now before they're all gone! Limited supply! Major returns. Great opportunity for a history lesson for everyone. Seasteading has been around since 1981. First mentioned in the book Sailing the Farm.Wayne Gramlich brought it into the forefront in his article "Seasteading  Homesteading on the High Seas" (1998).Patri Friedman, grandson of Milton Friedman, became interested in seasteading from Gramlich's work and the two collaborated on a book in 2001. The two ended up starting The Seasteading Institute (TSI) in 2008. The big buzz being that Peter Thiel donated about $500k in matching funds to get TSI started.The Seasteading Institute has gone through several presidents, boards, etc. in the 10 years that they've been around. Patri staying on as a board member. Randy Hencken and Joe Quirk were the main folks running TSI since 2012. Marc Collins, former Minister of Tourism of French Polynesia contacted TSI late in 2016 telling TSI that French Polynesia was the perfect place for seasteading due to the rising sea levels affecting their islands with no viable solutions in sight. Ironically he contacted TSI after reading a "seasteading is dead" obituary article (sound familiar?).In January of 2017 the president of French Polynesia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with TSI to begin a pilot project in a protected lagoon in one of French Polynesia's many islands. TSI, being a non-profit, set up the for-profit company Blue Frontiers in May of 2017 to manage the Special Economic Zone which would be created by French Polynesia.My interest in seasteading goes back to 2008. I was interested in it for the same reasons I started following Bitcoin back in 2010. I think they can both disrupt the power structure of the world in similar ways. I see Blue Frontiers as the most viable project that has come along in this space and fully support them.I am also excited by the fact that no matter what your criticism, the project will move forward. I look forward to many obituary posts from you as we grow and move forward.   I swear franky, sometimes I think you're posting from a time machine. I'm glad you're enjoying looking into Blue Frontiers which just celebrated their one year anniversary in May.I will enjoy Tahiti. I did quite well as an early adopter of your project, Bitcoin. So thank you.Always a pleasure reading your posts. +merited Thank you for the information. I'll check those out. I am seeing many shorts that need to be wrecked. Yes...perhaps I should start reading some Karl Marx and turn commie.That's the philosophy to adopt when you're broke. I just had a chilling thought...Have all previous ATHs dropped below their previous ATHs?Did we go below $32 after $266? That's what I'm trying to figure out. It would need to rely on knowing that only certain addresses are on the network.If the only addresses allowed are A,B,C,D,E,F then you could have A open a channel to B, B to C, etc.If everyone knows that only those addresses can be used then they could see that no new bitcoins are going to those addresses (thus increasing the satoshis on the network). If someone increases the amount on one of those addresses without conforming to the colored coin, then it would be rejected.But if A opens a channel to B, then A opens a channel to S (which has a lot of BTC) then A could send a shitload of satoshis to B which represent something else.I only understand LN at the high level so I'm not sure if this is possible. And thank you for the great response as always franky. Franky still believes that Blue Frontiers is my company even though I have mentioned several times that I, like those that wrote their recommendations in those pdfs, are just enthusiastic volunteers offering our support of a great project.I look forward to your input on the other volunteer group input papers as we release them. Always a joy to read your posts franky.At least you finally saw that the project is a bit more than "Elwar just posting some pretty pictures of his project that he spent years putting together". For bounty questions join https://t.me/joinchat/GZKGqEhBqxYxUWmRumSE8Q Respectable enough to be among the elite who are asked to shill shitcoins.Probably only a handful of people hold that distinct status. Vitalik quoting Satoshi who expanded upon Leslie L? I had to laugh at this mail I got on reddit. Quality of my posts?  I wear the shittyness of my posts with a badge of honor. I agree with the capitulation thing. The last down cycle we sat near $200-$300 for nearly a year. I figure that shook out a lot of people from 2013 that were just waiting for it to "go back up so they could sell.I held all the way through 2010 to 2012 only to cave at the end of 2012 as it was starting to come back up. As a n00b those were some tough times. But I believed in Bitcoin. Most people who got in last year are about as Bitcoin savvy as the people in Vegas at the Evolve conference.
I just bought a Renault Twingo for less than 1 BTC. 2012...newest car I've ever owned. I know history doesn't repeat itself but rhymes and such, blah blah...Here is my quick rough picture showing where I think we are if we are repeating the previous cycle. My best friend went through the whole thing to become a financial adviser. He convinced me that whole life insurance was a good investment.It wasn't until I was trying to defend it in an online forum using math that I realized how horrible it was. Part of it is poking fun at legacy finance folks that I've started seeing on reddit. Financial advisers that were so good at their jobs that they never saw how well Bitcoin would do. For some reason their government required certifications did not include looking into things outside of their bubble. And instead of recognizing a potential new technology, they attack it because they need to protect their old system (after all, they did invest a lot of time in those classes and certs). Apparently reddit does not like my humor (or lack thereof).https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96mnhp/for_those_who_bought_bitcoin_to_get_rich_my/downvotes galore Ethereum came as a split from the colored coin approach. With colored coins people realized that they could create assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each satoshi could represent a single asset (1g of gold for instance). They even implemented OP_RETURN so you could add details about the underlying asset.One big thing many people working on colored coins ran into was the limited amount of bytes that could be used for each transaction (a lack of creativity left them wanting to fix this limitation with more bytes instead of working with second layers). The possibilities of what could be added to to each transaction if there were more space was discussed. The golden idea was to have enough room for turing complete programs on the blockchain. Vitalik took on the task of enhancing the colored coin approach on the Bitcoin network to allow for turing complete code. The Bitcoin community became excited about this Ethereum colored coin approach and put a lot of support behind it.Then Vitalik decided to shit all over Bitcoin and everyone who had supported him up until then and take the easy way out by creating a new coin called Ethereum with a whole new blockchain that had enough room for these turing programs.There was a reason that Bitcoin limited the size of transactions. You don't have to attack it head on. For decades the push by those that are enlightened was to end the Fed.But Bitcoin offered us an alternative approach. Instead of ending the Fed, create an alternative path for people to choose instead of Federal Reserve Notes.Same with taxation. Don't work on ending taxes in tyrannical states. Work on creating alternative paths for those that get it. Something like seasteading. If anyone has some spare time I would love to see the trend of the price excluding these huge jumps and falls within minutes.I think that would show the true sentiment of the market. As suspected, Bcash was being pumped.I don't think the rest of their btc will be able to get bcash to a sellable value. Time to start pulling out the old wallets and get what I can. Analysis by some Wall Street analyst that was on "awesome investor list" back in 2014.If this guy is such a great investor, did he see the bitcoin price rise coming in 2014 when he was at the top of his game? Was he advising people with his analysis to buy bitcoin?If not this guy's outlook on the future is shit. I don't think that any of us can deny that it is mainly whales pushing the price up and pushing it down.This really has nothing to do with typical sentiment of the average user or some sort of good or bad news. Other than the fact that the whales may believe that the market will not fight them in one move or another as they swing things back and forth.The key being, which way do these whales want the price to go? Well they are certainly not in bitcoin because they read the white paper and were inspired. They have balance sheets that need big profits. We will see. I really do wish Wall Street would stay out of bitcoin. Bitcoin can grow without it, and will likely be around long after it. If the drop were due to the ETF being delayed then shitcoins would not be dropping so much. Since it's BTC getting the ETF, not shitcoins. Don't let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, Bubba "Spare Tire" Dixon. I can still log in. Yes, I was doing mostly small amounts when I was in Germany. Mostly just for spending money. But I got tired of going to McDonalds almost every day or driving all over the place during my off hours just to get 50-100 euro. So this guy wanted 50k euro worth, I told I'd do 20k but upped it to 30k because I decided I'd just do this one sale and I'd have enough euro for a few years in Germany with no more driving all over the place to wait for people to show up (or not show up).The guy that robbed me came at one time and we did 5k. Went smoothly so I was comfortable with a larger amount.German law kinda pushed me into larger amounts. By banning LBC in Germany the response was to just freeze everyone's current advertisements. Which was in its early days. Which meant that my ad making 15% on each trade was the only one in my area.It's really hard to turn away an almost instant 15% profit.  The team was professional, 4-5 people. While one distracted me, another came up from behind and not only did he pick pocket the money from my pocket, he replaced it with a counterfeit stack the same size. So while my hand was off of the stack of bills for maybe 30 seconds, it was replaced very quickly. The McDonalds was across the street from a police station, I was confident that I had the money in my pocket as I walked across the street to the police station parking lot where I parked. Then changed up my route on my drive home.It wasn't until I was safe at home that I pulled out the money and saw that it was all fake (I had verified the money was real before putting it in my pocket and releasing the coins). Boring old story that is all too common.Boy meets eastern european LBC customer at McDonalds. Eastern european cartel coordinates to steal 85 BTC from boy.Boy warns people on LBC forum.German stazi reads about such a large sum being transacted by boy.German stazi show up at boy's house a week later at 5AM and take all of his shit.Boy hires a lawyer.Boy gets his shit back (a year later after having replaced all of his shit so now it's useless).New story from localbitcoins.My gf is now selling BTC on localbitcoins in Thailand.Apparently some Nigerian scammer went after some old Thai lady. He had the lady deposit money into 10 different accounts on 17 different occassions. 3 of those occasions was to my gf's account when the Nigerian used it to buy bitcoins.Now the police froze her account while they investigate.I'm just trying to figure out what scam would convince someone to deposit money into so many different accounts so many times.  Throughout the last year I was told how "lucky" I was to have so many bitcoins. They wished they got in so "early" like me, that they were not so "lucky".Think of all of the people selling right now. Think of all of the people buying right now. The people selling are doing something easy. The people buying are doing something hard.Holding BTC right now is hard, it's not easy. When you do something that is hard and are rewarded, that is not luck. That is a reward that is earned.I have earned every bit of what I have, and then some, having been through these tough times several times and not buckled.I am not lucky. I am strong. Group picking up the Finding Satoshi story and trying to make it reality.https://bcfocus.com/news/finding-satoshi-nakamoto-team-of-private-detectives-to-set-out-on-a-global-quest-for-bitcoin-daddy/20809/ Gentlemen.

Well, I brought a young Romanian lady with me so she enjoyed the pool and the drinks. I enjoyed her in her swimsuit and the nice Jacuzzi tub in the room (among other things). Chinese also do not understand the concept of queues. I guess with so many people they needed to figure out how to push their way forward in very limited space. At the immigration line in Thailand me and another large westerner had to play defense against these people trying to sneak past. It was futile. Ron Paul was on National TV at prime time speaking truth to power and the spin was that "he's crazy, don't listen to him".Do not underestimate the ability of the propaganda machine to cover the truth, even if it is broadcast briefly on their networks. I did a week at an all inclusive resort in Antalya a few years back. Turkey is like the Mexico of Europe in that regard.Everything was as a 5 star resort should be. Except the dominance of Russians who would wake up at 6AM to put their towel on the open chairs by the pool. My capitalist ass didn't have a chance against the former communists who knew best how to take advantage of limited free resources. Umm...recognizing a double bottom is quite fruitful on this thread.Much better thing to see than burned shorts. Can you imagine the private key ownership of these government entities?I used to use a smart card at work. This was for a network used by just about everyone in the military and most of the government.They had one guy in the world that had a single key that was used to secure all of these cards.At one point, he quit.I found this out after my card shit the bed and I was waiting for 3 months to get a new card so I could get access to my computer (trust me, I really didn't care...I was still getting paid for not working). They told me that a lot of people were in the same predicament. They urged people to please turn in their cards when they left their jobs (so they could be re-used). We hit $5.8k twice. That was the long term double bottom.The medium term (this past month) double bottom was at $6.2k. From Peter Thiel to Libertarian Utopias, Seasteading has long been the subject of rumours and speculations.To set the story straight, we have launched a media archive, which we have populated with some of the more accurate articles about Blue Frontiers and seasteading from the past two years. We will issue factual responses to new media stories as they come out.https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/pirates-and-fake-news-on-the-high-seas-2cadf103948cMedia Archive:https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/media What tyrannical shithole do you live in where you get your water and electricity through the government? Let me guess, your taxes pay for garbage service too?lolReminds me of someone who asked "without taxes, how would the government provide basic services like the dentist?" Perhaps you meant $15,000? I'm no chart expert but I've followed this thread long enough to know that a double bottom is a good thing.So...double bottom pics please They claim I can withdraw my NMC on the 13th. And the talk is about closing the site on the 15th.What do you want to bet there is some sort of "complication" in the 2 day window that does not allow me to withdraw my NMC?I am willing to bet anyone 21k NMC that I won't be able to withdraw it. *beep* *oop* *burp**I am a robot**fear the IRS**end of transmission**derp* *fap* *boop* The key thing that keeps me bullish on bitcoin and makes me never want to buy dollars with my bitcoins is this:and this:Our defense budget, the third largest spending item, is just over $600 billion per year. Just the interest on our debt is about to surpass that.What happens when the interest on our debt is higher than spending on anything else? Do we just raise taxes and pay it? Can you see the politician that has the balls and stands up in front of the American people and says "we're raising your taxes. Not for new schools, roads, defense or infrastructure. We're raising it to pay for overspending in previous years. You won't see one benefit from the raised taxes. And more than likely it will actually have zero impact."But how about this scenario: "Holy shit, that's a lot of debt. How about if we print the amount to cover the interest payments and use tax dollars for everything else. All in favor?"Of course, what happens when the US government is printing over $600 billion in new money each year with a $3 trillion money supply? What about when that number reaches $1 trillion? 33% inflation rates year by year. Venezuela starts to happen.Who wants to buy some of those debt based IOU dollars? Great rate at just $6300/BTC. Get them while you can. *beep* *oop* *burp**I am a robot**taxation is not theft if the government spends the money right**end of transmission**derp* *fap* *boop* But...a scam with low fee.And 24/7. I see what you're saying. Yes, I meant that due to the fact that you're essentially creating a transaction between two entities it's still on chain. It just does a bit of back and forth before finalizing.I was thinking a bit more on this. I see a lot of overhead pictures of the current Lightning Network with addresses and such. Is this something that anyone can see? All of the nodes of the network? If someone were to open a channel from an address that is not in the approved list of addresses, could that node then be shut out of the rest of the network? Any coins coming from that node being "tainted". The takeaway here is that over the long term bitcoin will prevail even alt coins jump during bull runs. There will be less and large bull runs with adoption and thus BTC will trend toward 100% dominance. Yep. I think you got it down. I think the trigger would be something like "if volume on the decentralized exchange is higher than the volume of the largest exchange (or all of them combined), then set price to the swap price on the dex". I think if the dex is one of the largest exchanges, the difficulty to manipulate the underlying value would be pretty high.And I do believe the address that is filled with BTC will need to play a large role in maintaining stability but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do it programatically without needing to go through Rootstock or ETH. Perhaps some sort of game theory which incentivizes the org in charge of the receiving address to maintain stability (like they charge a percentage above the price, and buy back at a percentage that it drops...thus constantly requiring the new issuance of tokens at the current price. Well, we did bounce off the the $6,200 price point.If that holds we likely go back up to around $8,400 before coming back down to $6,800.Wee.
There's not so much an issuer of the cryptofiat as basically anyone sending BTC to that single address is now able to "issue" tokens from their own address (up to the amount they "purchased"). The address could even be a burn address like 1XXXXXXXX... But I have been kicking around the idea that the address is used to fund further development or even buy back cryptofiat if the market deems it necessary. Not a single person but likely a decentralized organization of some sort with multi-sig access to the address.The control of that address could disappear (keys lost, people controlling it die off, etc.) and the system would still continue on with no disruption.I use bisq as reference but it would likely be a modified version so a user does not necessarily need to download any software (make it web based). While still being able to download software and avoid the middle man. This part is a bit unhashed but I believe that it will need to start small and grow (likely starting in a small country with few or no exchanges). It will start as a single server but anyone who downloads the software and wants to run their own server (exchange) can also do so. The exchange could charge fees or advertise or whatever they need to make money which allows them to enhance the user experience and advertise to draw more people in. With more volume on the exchanges they're all using the p2p in the background. It's just that the user doesn't know (or shouldn't even care).The point of the namecoin list of exchanges is so that initially the price can be set to a specific formula (ie. take the volume from Bitstamp, Bitfinex, GDAX, etc. combine and divide to get the price). The price will need to be known by everyone so that the cryptofiat can be the price of the underlying currency while still using satoshis (ie. when someone sends BTC to the initial address at $7k/BTC and 1 satoshi = $1, then everyone in the network knows that the person can issue 7k satoshis and they can ignore any further satoshis sent from that address by consensus. Since there will be such low volume initially, the price on the decentralized exchange will be too easily manipulated.But you can't just have a single issuer deciding the price to be used. So initially it will be centralized, then grow more decentralized over time. Then at a trigger point the price is based on the price on the decentralized exchange (due to high enough volume). I figure the "issuers" should be given the ability to determine the price formula that is used.It certainly is like a decentralized Tether. The main problem with Tether is that it's run by a single company. They have(had) a bank account. Disruption of that single company/account can bring it all crumbling down.The Bitcoin price can (will) fluctuate no problem. When issuer X buys at $7k they get 7k satoshis. If the price jumps to $10k when issuer Y buys then they can issue 10k satoshis.Trade on other platforms is more than welcome. If it is known that 1 satoshi = $1 then not only can it just be used for exchange, it can be used in commerce. Merchants can start accepting cryptofiat alongside regular fiat. My ultimate dream would be that cryptofiat becomes so much easier to use than regular fiat that nobody uses regular fiat anymore. Banks become useless and eventually when BTC price reaches the point where 1 satoshi = $1, people will now just use their cryptofiat as bitcoins. Essentially, bitcoin has now replaced a government currency.Trust is certainly essential. I believe that if a single exchange is run like this for a while and reaches high enough volume then it will sort of prove itself. Initially it will be centralized and controlled with the mechanisms built in to grow more decentralized over time to the point where it is fully decentralized. People already trust that when they send money to an exchange that the numbers in their database correlate to their money. A lot less trust than I would give but these exchanges are trading hundreds of millions each day so obviously some people trust these database entries. I'm not liking the new crop of folks that came in this past year. They don't really know anything about Bitcoin (Satoshi? Is that some sort of seafood?). They just want to see the price go up. Maybe the government can pass a law to make the price go up. That's all that matters.I hope the price crashes to the point that they all sell the bottom and never come back until they're paying for their bread after waiting in the bread line with bitcoins. It wouldn't be off-chain because it's using bitcoins.  Yes, I definitely think the Bisq to a cryptofiat would be the key thing to enable more widespread decentralized exchange. The swap from cryptofiat to cryptocurrencies is easier from there.My proposed solution (and I am currently putting together the pieces to test this out) would be:-Have a single BTC address from which you can purchase cryptofiat. Initially the price would be set and known throughout the network based on a namecoin list of exchange addresses (more on that in a bit).-The addresses that purchase the cryptofiat would be known by the network and the amount they purchased could be sent from them in colored coins, with 1 satoshi = 1 unit of the currency, to open a channel on a cryptofiat Lightning Network.-Bisq can then be used to convert fiat to cryptofiat. User can then open a Lightning channel to receive their colored coins. -With those colored coins they can easily do an atomic swap for bitcoins, or do multiple micro swaps so that someone can sell just the smallest unit possible adding up to a full purchase rather than needing one person to buy the full amount offered by another person (ie. 50 people can buy from someone offering 1BTC for 7k cryptofiat).Now back to the cryptofiat price. Initially it would be centralized. It would likely start as a centralized exchange with a website, etc. But using all of the pieces in the background. The user doesn't really even know the difference. Those that buy cryptofiat with bitcoins can start to have some input on the namecoin list of exchanges used (some sort of voting mechanism based on amount purchased and time passed).Eventually, the goal would be to set the price to the publicly known price of the last trade in the decentralized swap. But initially the volume would be too low to do so. But when that is triggered it becomes truly decentralized and unstoppable.No tokens needed, ETH not necessary, Rootstock not needed. All done by consensus through Bitcoin. The hope being that a typical user would just log into a website (or open an app), put in how much money they want to send, they get the highest rated Bisq seller for their criteria (bank, amount, location, time, etc.) and they just send their money. They see that they have money "in their account" and can now purchase bitcoins (just like on any other exchange). They purchase it and withdraw their BTC. Same in the other direction. I used to think that the flat earthers were just trolling everyone, like those videos that went out with kids downloading noises that could get them high...but either they have marvelously trolled everyone to the point that some people actually believe it, or they are wholly ignorant of reality...and should be listened to for total entertainment purposes...like a psycho on the street corner with a sign spouting off about the jews and illuminati I agree, I may have actually watched the election instead of turning off all media, including Facebook, in August of that year when it just got far too bad. The trigger for me was walking into a friend's living room where CNN was playing and seeing Wolf Blitzer talking about latest events blatantly using the term "we" when talking about what needed to be done to stop Trump. Something like "how do we....<insert plea for a strategy to get Hillary elected>". It was like I walked in on a DNC headquarters briefing. My Facebook feed on both sides was also absurd.I'm all for free stuff. I bet I can one-up anyone on the amount of free stuff I want to have give away. Try me. You're definitely not as caring as I am when it comes to the government giving out free stuff (why don't you want free food for kids? Do you hate children?).But the extortion part...not a fan. It does go deep, not just in government but in promises that go back generations.They say that the countries that advance the fastest are those that just had a revolution and are starting from scratch. They have a clean slate and can move forward as a country without the baggage of backroom deals made decades ago. I just got bitcoinj up and running. I have been able to run the example Kit program a few times which takes a long time before it connects to enough peers to download the latest block but occasionally it does, then ends as it is supposed to.I'm trying it on testnet. I have run it for an hour and it won't connect to any peers. Is this just me or is it common?I get warning messages such as this:[NioClientManager] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - [46.19.33.249]:18333: Peer died      (0 connected, 8 pending, 12 max)[PeerGroup Thread] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - Waiting 10000 msec before next connect attempt to [178.21.118.174]:18333[NioClientManager] WARN org.bitcoinj.net.NioClientManager - Failed to connect with exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further informationjava.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information....[PeerGroup Thread] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - Waiting 10000 msec before next connect attempt to [78.47.230.62]:18333[NioClientManager] WARN org.bitcoinj.net.NioClientManager - Failed to connect with exception: java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException: null[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerSocketHandler - [52.178.146.191]:18333: Timed outjava.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException....[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerSocketHandler - [194.187.248.133]:18333: Timed out[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - [194.187.248.133]:18333: Peer died      (0 connected, 1 pending, 12 max)[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerSocketHandler - [194.187.248.133]:18333: Timed out[PeerGroup Thread] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - Waiting 10000 msec before next connect attempt to [78.47.230.62]:18333[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - [194.187.248.133]:18333: Peer died      (0 connected, 0 pending, 12 max)[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerSocketHandler - [144.76.75.197]:18333: Timed out[PeerGroup Thread] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - Waiting 10000 msec before next connect attempt to [14.202.104.193]:18333[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - [144.76.75.197]:18333: Peer died      (0 connected, 0 pending, 12 max)[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerSocketHandler - [144.76.75.197]:18333: Timed out[PeerGroup Thread] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - Waiting 10000 msec before next connect attempt to [50.39.117.154]:18333[AbstractTimeoutHandler timeouts] INFO org.bitcoinj.core.PeerGroup - [144.76.75.197]:18333: Peer died      (0 connected, 0 pending, 12 max)Is this common or no? Would it be possible to create a colored coin exclusive Lightning Network?Say I proclaim that all satoshis coming from address "1XYZ..." are poker chips to be used for some decentralized online casinos (or whichever).Then people open LN nodes moving microtransactions of these single satoshis back and forth opening channels. All is well until someone creates a node that is connected to the network. Then opens a second node and feeds bitcoins from another address and floods the network with new satoshis. You can't trace where the bitcoins in the network originate from so you wouldn't know if the coins you receive are from the fake address or not.How could it be done so that only satoshis originating from "1XYZ..." are allowed on the network? We dropped below a support line at $6800. Next support level is $6200.If we drop below that we're looking at All Time (this year) Lows. The answer is:Whatever my tax funded school taught me. I respect that the Bern was against the Federal Reserve. I don't fault him for having an expensive house like most people point out. He deserves the product of his labor.But as for his democratic fascism...not a fan. How can you be positive when it's all over man? With WEX about to shut down, Jamie Dimon saying Bitcoin is a scam? I mean...Jamie Dimon! Who doesn't listen to his advice all day?Doom I tell ya. Blood in the streets type of doom. Here is a simple infographic that shows how the seastead will work:https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/infographicBlue Frontiers is also releasing the "State of the Art" reports presented at the end of 2017 by the various subgroups.https://blue-frontiers.com/docs/State-of-the-art_report_-_Food_Systems.pdfhttps://blue-frontiers.com/docs/State-of-the-art_report_-_Energy_&_Water.pdfMore to come. I predict WEX shuts down within a week. I used to get root through the printer port on an old Sun system in college. su - sp1 (or something like that). So easy. Governments enable collusion, especially in the US, by making entry into a market more difficult. Either through regulations, permits, expensive legal hoops to jump through, etc.Imagine you have a car design that is better and cheaper than all current cars sold. You build the car in your garage and want to start selling and scaling up to full production of these cars. Do you really think you could just set up a factory and start selling them? No. The amount of regulations required to become a car manufacturer is insane. It's almost as if the 3 or 4 auto manufacturers in the country are paying politicians or something. Tesla tried to do it on their own but had to play ball and pay off the government to get to the point of being able to sell cars.Almost every other industry has permits, required certifications and schooling, etc. These are not for any useful purpose other than keeping out competition.I currently live in French Polynesia where there are only 3 banks. No new banks can be created due to the amount of regulation requirements to open one. So the 3 banks set the prices on various things very high. It costs about 20% to exchange dollars to francs. And of course, only the banks are allowed to exchange currencies due to government regulations. If there were no government intrusion into money exchanges you'd have people at the airport charging 2-3% just standing there waiting as people get off the plane. You'd have your taxi driver exchanging cash for you. I'd be able to set up a bitcoin exchange here, an ATM at the airport. But it's not allowed. He wants to save Bitcoin by centralizing and regulating it.Our savior!Can't wait for these Bakkt coins! Price is still under $10k... Look up the word tax:
Collusion is almost the same as a monopoly, it's just an oligopoly. Again, it cannot exist without government. They require the government to ensure that nobody outside of their group comes in and takes all of their customers by providing a lower price. Governments tend to provide that service (the service of keeping competition out of the market).Imagine the road running next to a long piece of farm land, through collusion, is making $100k per year just for that strip. The farmer knows that the same square meters of his land only brings in $20k per year. He is now incentivized to build a road on his property instead of food. He can then undercut the road company and take all of the customers. Same with every single property next to the road. Without the government there would be no way an oligopoly would stop people from competing.If you look at old pictures of the future back when roads were first being developed you had airships, airplanes all over, walkways from building to building, etc. We only have a car dominated transportation system we have now because the roads are "free". There would be many different sorts of transportation if roads were not free.Then again, you are certainly not the first person to ask about the roads when it comes to no taxes.Here is the official "what about the roads?" thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=345749.0 Thank you for the feedback. I found an older namecoinj but will check out Consensusj. Is there a spv wallet for namecoin?Something like bitcoinj? With these super low prices we may need to shut down the blockchain.Fortunately they released Satoshi's alert key.Time to trigger the shutdown switch? Or might things turn around?I'm scared.Help. Monopolies cannot exist without government force. It just doesn't work.I can only site one case of a natural monopoly in the United States that did not use the force of government. That is the company that manufactures those little white pieces of cardboard for priests to wear around their collars. I'm thinking the only reason it was a monopoly was that there was not much motivation to disrupt that industry and the company likely kept prices low for ideological reasons. Whelp, we tried.Anyone have any good leads on some super sweet municipal bonds I can jump on? I'm hearing that they're giving some super sweet 2% yields over 20 years. Wow, that's different from the 1000 other sheep in this thread. Thank you for the valuable insight.You are all paying taxes on the few scraps you get from your signature campaigns...right?Because the ends justifying the means and all.  I just re-took the test and it said INTP instead of INTJ as I had previously thought.I was always bothered by the descriptions that said I was very organized and stuck to a plan. Perhaps when I took it I was thinking about money. But no, I'm never on time for anything.Either way. I like to sit alone and stay inside and enjoy the world I create inside my head. Strangely enough, I just had my gf take that test last night.INTJ and ENTP...neither of us have our feet on the ground. Either we'll achieve big things or crash and burn. There are some examples of private roads, and most people who are for privatizing would require some sort of easement to ensure that people are not locked in their homes. I imagine road systems would be local, regional and national. Where local roads are treated differently from national roads.If you have ever been to Disney World you have driven on a private road. Disney wants people to be able to get to their park easily so they purchased all of the roads going into their park and have built them and maintained them on their own so that they don't have to worry about huge traffic jams or degrading roadways for their customers. Most believe that local roadways would be paid by businesses that want people to have easy access to drive to their stores. Ever turned off of the government road onto a large shopping center parking lot with roads? Those are all private. There was a bridge between the US and Canada that was losing money for the governments of both sides even though they charged a large fee for everyone crossing. They ended up privatizing it and not only did the company that bought it lower prices but they made it profitable.Phone companies could also raise prices on those cell towers as well. Make it so expensive so that only the world's richest can use cell phones. So why don't they do that? Could it be that companies that are in business to make money actually want to make money? Private roads would be the same. More customers equals more money. Why would they want to push people out of the system by making it harder for people to use their service?I'm just one person on the Internet with an idea of how private roads could work. But if they were private there would be tens of thousands of people with entrepreneurial spirit trying to figure out a better solution to beat the current competition to offer better solutions. We would go from our current system in the same way that we used to have our home phone lines to an advancement system in roadways akin to our current smart phones in our pockets.In a way, people who want taxes to pay for roads are getting in the way of the potential that transport could achieve. If it weren't for the government monopoly.And if they raise the price on a certain group of people....Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. I'm looking at that sparkswap app thinking...that's how easy it should be...Meanwhile my German bank just e-mailed me saying for "security reasons" they cannot let me transfer any funds out of the country from my bank account. That I have to come in personally to un-block my account. I live in French Polynesia and have no plans whatsoever of ever returning to Germany.Meanwhile, in Germany, they consider bitcoin a private currency. Which means that localbitcoins was asked to pay the 250k euro foreign exchange license. To which they said "fuck you" and locked all ads in Germany. So I can't simply transfer my money to some dude locally in Germany for bitcoins.There is bitcoin.de which is an exchange. But it's p2p, I'd have to hope that I get someone selling that lives in Germany. And I registered there once before and they know I'm a US citizen so I'm blocked.We just need all fiat to be colored coins on a separate bitcoin lightning network which can be easily swapped in a decentralized market.When it comes to bank accounts. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. What does it matter what a thief does with the money once he has stolen it?There are two separate issues here. How the money is obtained. And how the money is spent. How the money is spent does not affect how the money is obtained.That is what people do not understand. If I kill a guy, then roast him up in a fine meal that I then give to some hungry people on the street, would you be trying to justify the murder because some people got fed? Would you not even care that someone was killed? Would people even have to ask the question "is killing people to feed people murder?". Would you be criticizing those that call it murder as being heartless? Not wanting hungry people to be fed. What about those poor starving children that just want a meal? How dare you call it murder?If this has been done for millennia, nobody would consider it murder. If someone else chimed in and said "maybe we can feed people without killing people" then the majority would have no clue how it could be done. So they would say that the killing is justified. Oh, but only "if the meal is prepared correctly". Because they cannot fathom any other way. My ideal method for raising funds has always been a "membership" type of up front payment that is voluntary. You pay up front a certain amount which allows you to buy a bronze, silver, gold, platinum, etc. package. Bronze might get you just the basic necessities that a government provides such as military protection but not a whole lot. The country may even decide to subsidize the bronze members through the fees for the more expensive packages. The more expensive package might include things like health care, education (all through college), etc.  These packages could even be private offerings to lump together a large amount of private services. And there could be competing industries (or blockchains) trying to get the most customers. So people are competing to give you the best government possible.As for roads. Consider that I once mentioned ending taxes online and someone from Britain could not fathom how people would be able to pay for their dental work without taxes. I used to live in a city with private fire department and private ambulance services. Most places I have lived in the garbage company was private. These actually exist yet people cannot comprehend how they can be done without the government. If you are too mentally lazy to consider things that already exist being private then you likely cannot imagine the roads being private. What I suspect would happen would be similar to how our cell phones work. Right now there are towers owned by various companies that rent out their frequencies to cell phone companies who then sell plans to consumers. When you pick up your phone and use data, you don't care that your data is going over some third party that is a contract with another company that is paying the company of the cell tower which then transfers data to another cell tower owned by another company, and on and on, changing hands through many many different private companies. In your mind, if you had to plan it all you would just have one entity "the government" run it all and it's all simple with no need to use your brain.Personally, I look forward to smart roads that charge your electric car as you drive while your car drives you at the optimal speed with no more car crashes all paid per meter on the lightning network. But none of that is possible if governments still hold a monopoly on the roads. This is the tech that will change everything.  I suspect that with the large amount of 2nd world citizens on this forum, most have been convinced by their governments that the state knows best.That is also why those countries are 2nd and 3rd world countries. As bitcoin price tumbles to extreme low prices that pretty much prove the central bankers right, this is how I spend my evenings. The state is obligated to serve the people. The people have no obligations to the state.Taxes only work if society accepts the morality that the government can use force to extract money from people.For millenia people have found this to be morally acceptable and have not questioned it.They also felt that slavery was perfectly moral because slaves were not humans.We overcame that morally accepted practice. We can overcome taxation as it is currently enforced. That's some commie bullshit right there.Your money is your money. Not something to be distributed "within the society fairly and just".If you don't own your own body or the product of your labor, then you are accepting that the government owns you. Same reason Russia was pouring money into Cuba.The great communist ideal must be replenished from outside in order to continue. It cannot stand on its own.The idea being if these countries can make communism successful in one place, then they prove that it works.
As the price drops to panic inducing low prices I will share a few stories for story time.I finally got my account unlocked on WEX after supplying details of every transaction I ever had with them, signing statements from the addresses of the receive addresses for all of my withdrawals, screen shots of receiving those transactions and sending the IP address of every time I logged into the system.My account was locked out but I am not able to withdraw my NMC for 2 weeks (I assume this is how long they believe they will still be around, or they need 2 weeks to pilfer the rest of my NMC). I used to have 21k NMC. I logged in to see 12k NMC and 9k NMCET. From the looks of things WEX was allowing people to withdraw NMC (likely because they could just use mine and that's all they had left). I guess their remedy for opening my account was to create a fake NMC token and distribute that as "just as good as NMC". As people quickly ended up dumping the worthless token lowering the price.So now I have to wait 2 weeks and watch as the whole thing implodes. But at least I can watch the last of my NMC get pilfered in the meantime.On another note, I've been trying to buy a car here in French Polynesia since February. Borrowing a friend's car while I try to sell enough BTC to get francs to buy a car. After only getting about $800 worth I was about to buy a scooter when I realized that I have 6000 euro in an old German bank account from a few years ago. That German bank account is on the European SEPA network. Many people here in French Polynesia are from France and have french bank accounts. So I found a guy from France who sold me his Twingo for 6000 euro. I sent the transfer though the online bank transfer and got the car. I got an e-mail today from the guy saying the transfer never went through. So I check the bank and sure enough, transaction was reversed "Please contact the bank for further details". The problem being...how do I call the bank in Germany from French Polynesia? I don't even have a number here, who uses phones? I opted for the data only plan. Furthermore I don't speak German so even if I get through I'll have to ask for someone who speaks English and they'll tell me "oh the person who speaks English will call you back, what's your number?". I re-sent the transaction, I e-mailed the bank and told them to e-mail me back. If it's not resolved in the next day or so I'll just use localbitcoins to sell a BTC to transfer to the guy's bank account.I just want to get all of my money off of these banks and exchanges and into wallets under my complete control. I should not need to ask permission or jump through so many hoops just to get access to "my money".Just a lesson to all of those that still have money in these types of locations, get them off while you still can. Not your keys, not your coins. Money in the banks is not your money. If the government did not have a monopoly on the roads...just imagine how much better they would be today.There was a government monopoly on telephones for 50 years from 1934 to 1984. Think of the advances in telephones during that time, and think of the advances after.We should be driving on smart roads right now. Or not on roads. Government fucked up roads. I have no TA on this or anything but I will officially declare that weekend pumps indicate a bull market while weekend dumps indicate a bear market.Let it be known. No. Taxes are most definitely not theft. What about the roads?! lol!On a completely unrelated note I received this e-mail yesterday:"I know who you are, I know where you live. If you do not send 2 bitcoins to this address within a week I will send a team to your house and you will never again see the light of day.<BTC address hidden for protection of the extorsionist>"To which I replied:"Wait a minute...what do you plan on doing with those 2 bitcoin?"The extortionist replied to my e-mail:"Well, we will use a lot of it for ourselves, we will up our game with better teams of kidnappers, upgrade our operation while leveraging the operation to take out loans to buy some guns and fight our competitors. Also, we will be donating a very small portion to helping the homeless and educating children."That was good enough for me. I sent the 2 bitcoins. Definitely not theft if some of the money is going to help the children. I think they just set 2026 as an expiration date of the law. Sounds like fun. Do you know of any projects that are close to having something like that created? Or I go die alone on an island in middle of nowhere. Perhaps a floating island. Though I won't be alone. There will be others who want to swim out past the breakers and watch the world die. Whether the price is up or down, anyone with bitcoins is rich in Venezuela Venezuelan bolivar/BTC. Last 3 months.Bitcoin to the moon!!! in Venezuela  Collectivism is a good sign of weakness. It shows that you are not mentally apt enough to see people as individuals with their own thoughts and ideals. Instead you lazily put people into groups based on whatever criteria you come up with to ease your weak brain from needing to think too much.Grouping people together based upon melanin count is just ridiculous. Melanin changes. It would make more sense to group people based upon eye color which doesn't change (though it can be masked). Pick a trait that doesn't change with sun exposure. Ear size? Hmm, that changes as you age. Best to go with eye color. That's about the only thing about your body that doesn't change throughout your life.Then you can put in your mind "everyone with green eyes is...X...", "everyone with brown eyes is...Y...". Of course, whatever eye color you have you need to define it as being superior.Perhaps that's why people choose the date they are born to group themselves. That doesn't change. "Geminis are all...X...!", etc. The guys at whatever KKK site is going today have many criteria on who is "truly white".Things such as, you can't date anyone non-white or you, by association, become non-white. If you have any non-white ancestry, you are then non-white. If you associate with non-whites you become non-white. If you have neighbors that are non-white you are now non-white (unless you burn a cross on their lawn, then that purifies you). If you are shorter than 5' 6" you are not pure white. If you wear pants that are not the exact correct size you are not pure. If your hair is longer than 1 inch you are a hippy who likely lives with non-whites so you are likely non-white. If you are not a protestant you are not pure. If you eat bread that is not white, you are non-white.So, basically there are about 12 people that are "pure white" that will be waging war against all those that are not pure.Should be a short war (but not by short people because they are over 5'6). Make it so. I take that as pro-war. You would find many friends in the Republican Party who love war.Bitcoin will make wars (especially long drawn out, meaningless wars) very difficult to fund. After going through the whole process of verifying my account on WEX.nz, sending them signed transactions of wallets I control that received LTC, PPC and BTC from them along with much more proof they sent me this:Utter bullshit. I'm not even a US resident. I haven't lived in the US for 5 years. Bitfinex was fine with non-US residents using their exchange. Non-US residents are not bound to the same SEC or exchange laws as US residents.They can just come up with some new reasons (after they have your money) on why they can keep your money.

I think the key to look for (I haven't been paying attention enough to the new ETF to know) is, if the CBOE is trying to change the rules in the same way that Winklevoss ETF did. Which they require some safeguards to manipulation according to their shit response.They said that they would approve something with existing futures markets if "an ETP listing exchange...demonstrates in a proposed rule change that it will be able to address the risk of fraud and manipulation by sharing surveillance information with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin"Is this what CBOE is doing? The SEC gave a roadmap for how they would accept a rule change:"existing or newly created bitcoin futures markets may achieve significant size, and an ETP listing exchange may be able todemonstrate in a proposed rule change that it will be able to address the risk of fraud andmanipulation by sharing surveillance information with a regulated market of significant sizerelated to bitcoin, as well as, where appropriate, with the spot markets underlying relevantbitcoin derivatives. Should these circumstances develop, or conditions otherwise change in amanner that affects the Exchange Act analysis, the Commission would then have the opportunityto consider whether a bitcoin ETP would be consistent with the requirements of theExchange Act." Looks like the rejected Winklevoss ETF might have spooked the ETF hype folks.The reason given is that there is too much manipulation of bitcoin prices outside the US.There is nothing different with the other ETF applications that would change that. No ETF because...bitcoin is traded outside the US.Unlike gold, oil, etc.? Exactly. The longer we go with Bitcoin as the dominant currency over Bcash the harder it will be for there to ever be a "flippening". Imagine 2 years down the road people saying..."ok, to use 'the real Bitcoin' you need to sell your Bitcoin Core coins and buy bcash, and change your wallets, and give up all of the second layer resources you've been using like LN, Schnorr, RootStock, etc."It's all moot though. Bcash has fallen to .1 BCH/BTC and falling.At it's highest price Bitcoin Gold was .06 BTG/BTC. Can we all agree to talk as much about BCH as we did about BTG when the price is down to .06 BCH/BTC? Yes, there was something in the encryption (I'm still not certain that the encryption was broken or it worked so well that the NSA didn't want people to use it). I recall in the late 90s getting a memo sent out to all government agencies warning us not to use IPv6, stating that the NSA found some vulnerabilities. Perhaps they found that they can't spy on each transmission.But the key being the analogy of more IP addresses. A 1 or 2 minute explanation promoting IPv6 and bcash can easily convince many people that it is superior. "We're running out of IP addresses/transactions per second. When we run out, IPv4/Bitcoin won't work anymore. This new protocol will fix that problem. Adopt it if you want to keep using the Internet/Bitcoin."The fact that the supposed solution is broken does not make the sales pitch. 
Even if bcash is better, look at IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 is objectively the better standard. It has enough IP addresses that you could have one for every electronic device in your home.IPv6 has been around since the late 90s. And yet we still use IPv4. Why? Everything has been built on IPv4. It's established. Getting everyone on the Internet to migrate to IPv6 just never happened. Could it? Should it? Maybe. But it didn't.With limited IP addresses the Internet stopped working right? No. They just adapted and used various layers to represent the various devices you use every day. You may have one router in your home which then assigns a local IP to your computers and phones. Most people have dynamic IP addresses so that when someone's no longer using an IP address it doesn't just sit there, it can be used by someone else. The Internet adapted. The end of the world did not happen as the IPv6 advocates proclaimed would happen once we ran out of IP addresses.So work with the current Bitcoin protocol and do what you can to make that work because that's what we've got.IPv6 is used for some LANs and other things within businesses. Maybe bcash can go that route. Who knows. At one point I considered building a bar out in middle of nowhere. Part of my idea was to have such rooms (for the drunks so they don't have to drive home).Have some sort of plastic covering for the bed and such. It's just a pod that you slip into, then once you leave it sprays it down. You check out your blanket I suppose. Or figure that part out another way.Something like this?As for starting an actual business that I thought would profit in one of these zones...you might as well ask me to start a business in a communist country. There's a reason they're run down. Their governments have run them to the ground and chased away anybody seeking to make a profitable business long ago. They'd be glad to have their next suckers to drain. Down on bad news of their sales being down.And here I thought all of my personal information was worth a shitload to these companies. I haven't been watching this mymenace guy but it looks like a bot.His response to infofront telling him he's off topic is to scream about Roger Ver. Most people point out the 1000s of other people posting off topic in response to being told their off topic.It's almost as if his posts are being taken from somewhere else, reproduced here for some sort of astroturf campaign. No, I wasn't looking at something special for crypto.What most early adopters face is very large capital gains. There was much discussion about this near the peak with many new millionaires not wanting to end up paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to the IRS with the sale of some of their bitcoins.The reason to look at this Opportunity Zone law is that you can defer all of the gains you gain from selling your bitcoins if you invest those gains into a business in one of these zones (potentially). And the reason to open your own business is that you can invest all of your gains into your own business which can be "Jim's Lambo store" which does nothing but sell Lambos (on paper) but has not yet sold any Lambos, but the owner of the store drives the only Lambo available in the store (purchased tax free from bitcoin gains that would have otherwise been a check to the IRS to funnel off to ISIS). Here is the FAQ from the IRS:https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questionsAnd the actual law:https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-Z Just like lending on Bitfinex, it's all about how much risk you want to take that the platform itself doesn't go under.You can make somewhere around 1% or so per year on your BTC lending to shorts. But if Bitfinex goes the way of many of the exchanges, then you lose all of your money. Even if we see a move downward, if you notice the angle of the downward moves they are leveling out.Either we've reached the bottom of the cup and are moving up or we are about to form the bottom of the cup. Either way, the handle of the cup is followed by moon. They stopped all comments on July 11.Likely because they read mine that I submitted that day and they needed no further comments.I said something like: Approve this ETF. Not to make Bitcoin more relevant, but to keep the SEC relevant.I'm sure they read that and decided "approved". Current price surge for Bitcoin is mainly based on ETF hype.Alts are not included in a Bitcoin ETF.But likely if it's a rules change that allows Bitcoin to get ETF approval, other alts will try to get ETF approval.The SEC then becomes the gatekeeper of which alts rise with Bitcoin. Well that sucks.I'll stick to waiting for the inevitable collapse.  Without corn subsidies where would we get our deliciously healthy corn syrup?Won't someone please think about Monsanto!  When you dump your US citizenship you have to pay the exit tax which is a few thousand dollars plus capital gains taxes on everything you own as if you had sold it when you left. Without actually selling it.My thought is that I can just draw out $35k per year to live on until the US implodes and there's no need to dump my citizenship.Or....find the hole in this Opportunity Zone thing and buy a 100 sqft box with an address and open a "business" to funnel more than just $35k through. When I get around to actually reading the law that passed. There are a few deserted lots in the Texas Opportunity Zones that are probably very cheap. Did anyone else notice that the price turned around when TERA left?Hmm...?Coincidence? I think not. Not likely.Europeans can just leave their country and not owe taxes. Not so much for US citizens. My first question is. Can I create a startup in one of these zones then invest bitcoins into the company which then needs a company boat for me to go travel around the world for the company? I opened a thread in Legal to discuss the Opportunity Zone tax law:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4740118.0 https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2018/07/17/an-unlikely-group-of-billionaires-and-politicians-has-created-the-most-unbelievable-tax-break-ever/"The heart of this new law: Opportunity Zones, or "O-zones," low-income areas designated by each state. Investors will soon be able to plow recently realized capital gains into projects or companies based there, slowly erase the tax obligations on a portion of those gains and, more significantly, have those proceeds grow tax-free. There are almost no limits. No limits on how much you can put in, how much tax you can avoid and, for most of the country, the types of taxes you can avoid, whether federal, state or local. No limits on how long those proceeds compound tax-free. And precious few limits on what types of investments you can make."Let's dig into this new tax law and figure out how bitcoiners with high capital gains can take advantage of this legal gift from Washington. Although I like it, I feel like this turn around is a bit premature.Sure, $5775 sucked. But I feel like we never hit that "zOMG THE WORLD IS ENDING!" couple of days that could have shaken out many weak hands.Was it my awesome acting? Did that help?Are we past the thought that Bitcoin could end?I would rather the price rise on fundamentals rather than some stupid ETF.Although I would consider putting all of my remaining retirement fund into an ETF so I guess there is a reason why people might think it is smart to get in before such a thing.And if there is no ETF? Bitcoin user not affected? Interesting. So essentially, I can sell all of my bitcoins and invest in something in some poor neighborhood. Then if I keep it 10 years I owe no tax.But what could survive in a poor neighborhood that would be worth anything in 10 years? Gold store full of gold? Lambo dealership?I seriously don't see anything in the US being as valuable in 10 years as keeping my bitcoins.
Also, someone hacked my Purse.io account today.I had nothing in there as I pulled everything out last week due to someone mentioning having problems getting their money out.But still...second account this week. I think I have everything of any importance set up with 2FA. Maybe it was due to trying to run a Bitcoin node on my laptop.The thing keeps crashing on me anyway (database gets corrupted and wants to start over) so I'll give that a rest. Wow...the $7,800 resistance has been broken and..!!..!!...the price is still under $10k    Should we get started on the next blockchain? Perhaps blockchain on the cloud this time? Should we IPO? Perhaps something in Plastics? With some of that railway technology... This is somewhat similar to some e-commerce sites that have a very low price for an item "say $1 for a $1000 TV". You "bid" $1 and if nobody else bids in a set amount of time you get the TV. But if someone else bids $2 before the timer runs out then you don't get the TV. Then $3, $4...etc. Eventually someone wins the TV for $50. Then they advertise the fact that someone just bought a fancy TV for "just $50!". The reality being that they made a whole lot more than $1,000 on that TV from the amount of bids. That buy wall is as fake as Craig Wright. Big buy wall popping up on stamp at $7680. So likely dipping down below that today  Edit: Well that was quick. The wall moved to $7595. Down we go. The major walls are at $7800 and $7850.Big walls.That I'm observing. No, that was from an old blockchain.info address (I use that because I can actually set the fees unlike breadwallet).  So the answer to this question was a simple "yes".Was that so hard? I had to wait all weekend for the answer. Mcafee predicted $15k by the end of July at the latest...so he only has about a week for the price to double. I see...the highest before the end of the year. I thought it was the price at the end of the year.$7777Same reason. If it is this low I will be sad and need some pitty mBTC. I sent a transaction today that was just a donation so I set the fee to 2 sat/b and it went through the next block. 3 cents. I spent the week going back through all of my btc-e transactions, the delivered coins that they sent me with e-mail confirmation. I got a screenshot of my wallet with the transaction plus signed a message with each currency they sent me. Sent it all to the customer service folks at WEX. Received an e-mail that they were looking into it. It's only been a year.Hopefully I can log in and pull off my NMC and be done with it. Maybe contribute to some NMC development. Resistance is at $7700? So the price was sitting above $7500 most of the day. Then someone dumped it down around $7350...now it's back over $7500.Any theories? Statistically in roulette the ball should land on black or red roughly 50% of the time.Seeing that it was black 6 times in a row I went up to the table and bet on red. Twice. It ended up landing on black 9 times in a row. (yes I know past performance does not affect future outcomes in roulette). I forgot what the third part of my trifecta was for the price jumping but two are a bunch of bcash shilling, and some huge orders on localbitcoins.#1 is going strong. So....halving sooner?   When I was a kid the TV told me that I need to hate the Russians. Then things changed in the late 80s and the TV told me I can like the Russians. Now the TV is telling me to hate the Russians again. The thing about PACs is that they don't give the money to the campaign. They do things like run ads in support of the candidate (you know how at the end they have to say who paid for the ad).Russia really did not want Hillary to win...she and the Democrat party had been bought out by the old USSR elite who still have a lot of wealth but are no longer in power. But they want back into power. Only one problem...Putin is there. So they work with the Democrats to drum up fear of Russia in the US so that we can go to war with them to topple the leadership and put the old bosses back into power (ever wonder why Russia are suddenly the bad guys again?).If the NRA was not allowed to take foreign money then that's pretty cut and dry. If they can, then no law was broken.
I will guess $4,000.Only because if it is that low I will be very sad and will need a few mBTC to cheer me up. FYI. To verify that I am still in control of my account.https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1ELWAR1qFQbfmpMhcsTaBniFRLewrYqGo2---July 20, 2018---G66OM3cEsEwaosWnMALZoy1+5KhsaEqAMeWjNv/MiYI1QC+lyyNFmOYVOl63JI0ocoBMsAKKCh3xQJ4Mk3k1AR4= Anyway...back to the bitcoin price tracking...Trend analysis will conclude that the bitcoin priceis still under $10k  easier to see now? Nah, it was foolish of me to just blindly log in even though I'm always logged in. Speaking of hacked accounts.My account was hacked a few days ago.I only noticed when I saw that "I" had merited 3 different accounts with 50 merits each. All in threads I had never visited.Long story short, I had googled something several weeks ago which pointed me to bitcointalk.to (a bitcointalk phishing site). Actually if you google search for almost anything related to bitcointalk almost all links are to bitcointalk.toFortunately I noticed before they changed my email and password and I was able to track down what happened.Check your merits. Especially for anything on July 17. That was the plan. Buy a catamaran and sail around.But sailing around doesn't allow for growing food locally or fish farming. It doesn't allow for enhancing your surroundings or growing your habitat for the long term. It makes it more difficult to maintain if it is both a home and a place that moves around. Also, moving to different countries is insanely complicated with visas and registering at every marina.So why not buy a boat and just keep it in one place? A boat is made to be moved around, not just sit in one place. So it has a lot of 'extras' specifically for movement that are costly and unnecessary. A seastead is purposefully built to be in one place. Sure, I could buy a house boat but those tend to be built for being docked to shore in a calm, protected marina. Ok, I found it in my browser history.https://bitcointalk. to /index.php?topic=1638278.0Did a google search to find out how to do animated gifs on bitcointalk.Damn, sneaky bastards. Thanks to ibminer for suggesting I check my browser history.Sorry for causing any trouble for anyone due to my mistake.Merits all around.Still scrubbing and locking down my computer anyway...wake up call I suppose. I agree, we worked every which way to not create a shitcoin. We spoke to so many lawyers, industry experts, all of the big ICO companies (Consensus, etc.), spoke with Vitalik, pulled in as much knowledge on our unique setup as we could. The difficulty being that the project is an international project that will have assets all over the world and maybe some in international waters eventually. Our team is international with 5 founders in 4 different countries, our build team in the Netherlands, staff and volunteers everywhere. We incorporated in Singapore then moved it all to Gibraltar after enough input.In the end we tried to get a utility token as close to being a security without it being a security but we are still taking the approach that if it is classified as a security we are still covered (no Chinese or non-accredited US citizens, KYC/AML, etc.). While varyon holders aren't directly profit sharing, it's structured in such a way that when we sell platforms the value of varyon 'may' go up (trying to word that in such a way that does not say what the SEC won't let me say).Personally I bought enough varyon so I can buy a bungalow or villa once they are created. They will also be used to pay for residency, used for voting, and paying for anything related to Blue Frontiers. While anyone is still free to accept whatever currency they want on the seastead (unless you're on the commie seastead under a dictator then you're stuck with the commie coin). In the bathroom. Next to the kitchen. With fresh water and electricity.I was just hanging out with a nice couple that is sailing around the world on their catamaran. They have a very nice setup with solar panels, all of their electronics for their Youtube channel (cameras, computers, etc.). Who uses books anymore? lol*he asks after driving his fuel burning car to his air conditioned building on his computer/Internet that is using electricity from some polluting source eating his remotely delivered processed food*Are you currently environmentally zero or positive impact?That's certainly not the end goal of seasteading, it's more of a side benefit of needing to wisely use resources to their maximum while being stewards of the immediately surrounding area for things like cash flow from tourism, being able to swim/dive in our own back yard, etc.How do you deal with the earthquakes/tornadoes/volcanoes/flooding/mud slides/hurricanes/tsunamis/droughts/snow/ice storms/hail? Is your home built to deal with all natural disasters or you do something crazy like buy insurance and take precautions depending on your location?And that earns you an ignore. Thanks for looking into this. I'm just glad that's all the hacker did.Now I get to spend the day scrubbing my computer for anything suspicious.  Fortunately I lock my keys up in cold cold storage plus they need to know which numbers I added/deleted. At what price will the handle of the cup begin forming? Ya, usually I just go to the address bar and type bitc and it has bitcointalk at the top.The reality though is I usually have about 20 tabs open at once and bitcointalk is usually one of them. So I rarely need to actually go to the site. Selling merit? No. I like my merit. That's why I only give 1 away at a time.I didn't know it could be sold. Maybe that's as good a reason as any to hodl them.Easy IP check will show my IP has been the same for the past month.And I doubt a hacker would continue to answer questions about seasteading for me in various threads. Or be able to capture my oh so classy level of wit. Especially since the accounts that were meritted look like russians.I've been offered the equivalent of about $1 per post for advertising in my signature. Never went down that path (I advertise Varyon because I support the project and volunteer for the project). I imagine the amount of money paid for merits wouldn't 'merit' even a second thought for me. Unless they're going for like 1 BTC each then PM me... Are we back to weekend pumps yet or no? My computer was online and connected but I wasn't posting on bitcointalk. But was likely still logged in at the time. I don't recall if the next morning I had to re-log in.I don't click on links to go to bitcointalk. I have been using the site for 8 years, I know the address. I just type in the URL. https://www.blue-frontiers.comThey have several video blogs, telegram, Facebook, etc. Just did a scan of my computer so I'm not seeing any virus or anything along those lines. I use antivirus but also do a scan with a secondary program periodically.I'm curious about who I would talk to about checking the IPs I've logged in as over the past week. Should all be the same country if it was me. The KYC/AML for the ICO is due to the fact that the token could potentially be considered a security by the SEC down the road so we're approaching the ICO conservatively following all of the rules we would follow if we were selling securities just in case. But we're trying to create it as a currency that will be used on the seastead.KYC won't really be a thing on the seastead (depending upon the governance of whichever platform you're on).It is definitely not set up to run away with the money. The initial raise is relatively small with a large reserve. This allows for getting just enough money to get the ball rolling, then they have to deliver on promises to keep the value of the varyon up in order to be able to utilize the reserves for building future platforms. It is in the company's best interest to deliver what they promise.The pre-sale ended last week with the raise about 80% of the way to the soft cap. That is a pretty good floor going into the main sale. Especially with a bull market returning. I always type in websites before I log in. Bitcointalk is always up for me. But thinking about it I did have to log in again several days ago.Could be a virus. Will check that out.
I know, I may have been hacked but...I checked my merits sent and on July 17 it shows 3 different merits given of 50 merits each for threads I have never visited.Very odd that someone would hack my account just to merit someone.I have since changed my password but I would have figured a hacker would do some more interesting things with a Legendary account than merit some people.Or is this a random bug. We are literally manufacturing oceanfront property. The cost per square foot will be less than comparable oceanfront homes (and will only come down over time). Yes, just like people living on these islands pay higher costs for the same luxuries, we likely will as well. Just here in Tahiti I pay higher prices for most things. Except tuna. I pay about $11/kg (about $5 per pound). Needless to say, I eat a lot of tuna steaks and such. Fruit (mangos, bananas, passion fruit, etc.) is also fairly cheap. The two responses we all get when mentioning seasteading is "what about the waves" and..."pirates".So ya, we're aware.That floating platform I spent last Sunday on has been there since before 2010 (when that news article about a cyclone hitting Tahiti came out).That platform is about 1/4 the size of the platforms we will be building (25m x 25m).Personally I plan on building an underwater bar. So maybe we can head down to the underwater bar, grab a pint and wait for the whole thing to blow over. The closer you get to the equator the less typhoons/cyclones/hurricanes.The island we are looking at is closer to the equator than Tahiti. But the reason such a storm made such news in 2010 is that they hardly ever get those here.Either way, we are a few hundred meters from the island where people already live. We will do as the other island residents do. Either hunker down or change to another island that isn't being affected by sea level rise.But the point of building a pilot project in a protected lagoon is to work on the engineering that allows us to build these in the open ocean. Crawl before you can walk/run etc.Everything we're building now has been built. It's all out of the box and works in the waters off of the Netherlands. We are just putting it in a different location and creating a community in a special economic zone. Something like this: tl;drtaxes are ok because majorities support them so fuck minoritiesSeasteading sucks because he doesn't understand that in French Polynesia you don't need A/C nor heat because the temperature fluctuates from about 20C to 27C throughout the year. Plenty of sunshine for solar and plenty of rain, humidity, salt water for fresh water. Also...people already live on these islands. People all freak out that a floating platform in a lagoon cannot exist because "problems". The people already living on the island may beg to differ with all of the reasons that they can't live there.As for the unlikely scenario of a floating platform being able to exist in a Tahitian lagoon...this is where I spent my Sunday last weekend:In a Tahitian lagoon lolWhat if I told you that the reason we don't have to fear pirates is...we are the pirates you fear.They paint the world full of shadows... and then tell their children to stay close to the light. Their light. Their reasons, their judgments. Because in the darkness, there be dragons. But it isn't true. We can prove that it isn't true. In the dark, there is discovery, there is possibility, there is freedom in the dark once someone has illuminated it.I usually push seasteading to libertarians because there are far too many environmentalists involved already and I'd rather have neighbors that understand that we don't need to centrally control every aspect of our lives. So I do not want to change your mind on the ridiculousness of seasteads. Just accept that taxes are good. Seasteads are bad. And stay on land. Where you are safe from burglars...terrorists...pirates. Aliens would understand bitcoin. Because that's how their money works.#alientech#satoshiwasanalien I was thinking about that the other day. Imagine an alien watching us humans as we travel through space gathering gold."Why do they expend so much time and resources to gather that metal? Is it vital to their survival? Do they need it for food or to reproduce?""No, they just gather it and hide it away in metal boxes so that other humans don't take it." What about the old USSR nukes for sale on the open market? If one of those were to be launched would it hit the intended target?Asking for a friend. Just thought this thread would be interested in Bitcoin Girl Thailandhttp://www.bitcoingirlthailand.comNews updates every day on the latest things happening inside the Bitcoin world. Is this news or rumor? Right now there are zero seasteads. The goal for libertarians is having seasteads in international waters. If we can take a step in that direction with a cooperative government then that's what needs to be done.As I have learned with this project, it's not so much a libertarian project as it is a project where we can start a government from a clean slate. Sure, libertarians will be content if the slate stays clean, but it opens up the opportunity to try all sorts of different types of governments that have never been seen before. Maybe a completely blockchain based government. Maybe we try out some old systems that worked until they didn't, but learn from the past. Who knows?We need to build these things. And that likely means building it on land. All land in the world is controlled by governments.We'll be doing the same thing in space but nobody is complaining to rocket companies that they are following Earth laws when they build their rockets. No, because kindergartners don't know the definition of extortion. ("the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats")You falsely believe that I don't want to share. There's a difference between being extorted and voluntarily sharing.Slavery was perfectly legal for a long time. Doesn't mean it was right.lol...if only this guy knew...I already left the country, working on that "boat" part.Renouncing citizenship would cost me more than I care to hand over to fund the bombing of children with white phosphorous bombs (and paying for weapons for ISIS).Again, your reaction to someone not wanting to be extorted is to think they are being greedy. It is more greedy to just want everything taken care of through a system of force instead of coming up with a better system that benefits society without force.Your ideas are so good that they require the point of the gun for people to cooperate. You can pay 0% taxes to the US if you leave the US and only take out $35k in capital gains per year.Or make less than $100k in income.Again. You have to leave the US to avoid such extortions. Sherman is a tool. "What purpose does Bitcoin have other than tax avoidance and criminal activity?"How about ending your ease of printing shit currency to fund your wars and paying idiots like Sherman to be idiots with centralized force. I'm not liking the panel they grabbed for their "panel of experts".A Ripple guy and a bunch of professors of the legacy systems.Ripple guy suggesting the Fed create a centrally controlled cryptocurrency. Or a cryptocurrency like...hmm...Ripple. Bitcoin is money, but not a very good one. Nothing wrong with our current system.Heritage guy: Not Bitcoin...blockchain! (at least he suggests they get rid of capital gains taxes on spending crypto). He also mentions that centralizing crypto under Fed control wouldn't work. Adoption rate would help with volatility.Professor: The US dollar has backing. Money is created by banks. Bitcoin not getting traction as a medium of exchange (likes Tether).Old legacy finance guy: Private currencies have existed before. Money over time has become more centralized. Will it become decentralized due to crypto? Not likely. Central bank digital currency is a horrible idea. An increase in centralizing should be avoided.They keep talking about a Federal Reserve deposit account.Final summary: Cryptocurrencies are interesting and developing, it looks like we'll be coming back to this topic later. This, my friend, is the definition of extortion. Pay or get fucked with.I am all for funding social buildings, schools, hospitals, fire fighting, all of those things.I also do not support extortion.These are two different things. You seem to think that one must exist in order for the other to happen.Why do you think you believe this? Possibly those schools funded by extortion taught that this is normal?﻿ I was starting to think about that. I tried to help get Ron Paul elected because I foolishly believed Americans wanted to be free. I realized the amount of time and money I wasted throughout my life trying to give Americans something they don't actually want. So I figured I would focus on my own freedom, everyone else be damned. So I started working on the seasteading project because ultimately that would be the only place where you can start a nation from scratch and actually have some freedom.But having money I am starting to think I can just follow the path of so many other rich people and buy my freedom. Either by doing it in the US or doing it in another country where my money goes further and can buy off law enforcement and politicians easier than in the US.No matter where I go in the world I am still not free of the US until I renounce my citizenship. They still extort money from me even living overseas. Musk has the right idea to find another planet.  Hey guys. I just checked the bitcoin price and wow...still under $10k 
Blue Frontiers is cooperating with the French Polynesian government to create a Special Economic Zone in one of their lagoons.They are also in talks with several other nations. Here is the final announcement of the results of the pre-sale:https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/results-of-the-varyon-presale-68f9bbc6685dA few highlights:"We raised 3100.97 Ethereum!""People from more than 50 countries purchased Varyon in the presale. We are proud that we have token holders on every continent..""Our social channels have seen over 4.5 Million impressions during the presale and the Blue Frontiers Community Telegram group now has over 2600 active members.""250+ media stories have come out about Blue Frontiers and Varyon since we opened the presale." But with inflation...that might get you a loaf of bread. This is not good.Triple top is in.    Pre-sale ended with 3100 ETH!Just 900 short of the soft cap. It is very likely we will have a commitment for that much for the main sale soon so I'm 90% certain that the soft cap will be reached before the main sale.The pre-sale was very much grass roots which is great. The people who actually believe in the project got in early enough to get the bonus. There will be plenty of smart money coming in during the main sale who understand the fundamentals of the financials of Varyon. Hopefully we can get some videos or simple guides to explain the complexity of what role Varyon will play in the seastead.This may be the end of the pre-sale but it is just the beginning of preparation for a huge main sale. Looking forward to it and wrapping it all up so we can get rolling on this. Up to 2850! A lot of people getting in at the last minute. Only 12 hours left to participate in the pre-sale.https://varyon.io Only 15 hours remain to get in on the pre-sale! Currently at 2465 ETH!On the ground here in Tahiti I am hearing good news that will be revealed for the main sale. Along with that news we will be delving a bit deeper into the updates to our whitepaper explaining the many things contributing to the value of your varyon. A bit of a learning curve but in the end, it's good for all varyon holders.Here is a sample:Wondering the steps for buying varyon?Start here:https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/how-to-participate-in-the-varyon-ico-43d4857b5a8f So...you're saying there's at least $1 billion potential in setting up a crypto gambling site...good to know Again, you act as if this is my project. I am an investor and volunteer, retired software engineer. Did I learn from my own project? Yes, there was a long thread (among seasteaders, not people with no knowledge of seasteading dissecting the project). That's how I knew when I found this other project (again, not started by me) that they had what it takes.To say that there is no architecture being done is very very ignorant. The company, Blue21 is an offshoot of DeltaSync. A company that creates floating homes and platforms. It's not rocket science to create a floating platform in a calm lagoon. I sat here in Tahiti on a floating platform this weekend (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Cqf94FSXg). Do I, personally, understand everything there is to know about "an architect has taken in all the details of waste, power, utility, transport, comunication". No, definitely positively not. I am not an expert in all of those fields (though I have 7 years of experience doing simulations of military radio networks plus a Bachelor's degree in telecommunications).The "libertarian utopia" articles are actually hit pieces by journalists that hate Peter Thiel. We don't claim that that is what we are building, you won't find anything having to do with libertarian in any documentation or anything the company announces (I personally want libertarians to be a part of this in the same way that I advocated for libertarians to get involved with Bitcoin early on because I'd rather have them benefit from it and have more input as things grow instead of what happened and everyone wants Bitcoin to be regulated so they can get rich). If you've only read my articles then you will see my biased slant of trying to push for libertarians to be involved. The seastead will be built and I will live on it so I want libertarian neighbors who won't complain if I wanted to smoke some medicinal plant (even though I wouldn't) or 3D print guns from my metal 3D printer. Last day to get your bonus varyon today at http://www.varyon.ioup to 15% bonus during the pre-sale Last day to get your bonus varyon today at http://www.varyon.ioup to 15% bonus during the pre-sale I'm thinking the next chapter past the block size debate will be the payment debate.I haven't been able to scan a QR code in the past few months and have it actually work due to differing protocols.Found some money on some Korean BTC wallet I had yesterday. Tried to add it to localbitcoins but it was looking for a different format (instead of just BTC address). I've had to switch to PayPal to pay my hosting service because I can't send money from my blockchain.info wallet to their BitPay QR code. I put him on ignore because he quoted and responded to our resident troll too much. =https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/varyon-presale-one-more-day-e2d5b318873cPre-sale ends tomorrow!Currently at 2382 ETH. I'm hoping enough last minute people buy enough to push it over 2500. A decent round number to reach.What are peoples' thoughts? 2500 during the pre-sale during Bitcoin's biggest bear market in years. I think it gives us a good floor going into the main sale. So...the Bitcoin volatility index is down to 3.5% (down from over 7% in December). Back in 2016 it was down under 1% just before the price started to move upwards. Same in January 2013 and August 2013 (1.7%).I think that the volatility index will come down next month, bitcoin will be boring, and the price will start it's move up from there (or it might take a couple of months to come down). I really should consider trading BTC.I can usually see the indicators of a jump. ie someone with a huge sell wall trying to push prices down before pumping them, high rated individuals on localbitcoins trying to buy very large amounts of bitcoins, etc.It's just too stressful though. I'd rather just buy and hodl. I bought the NMC a long time ago when they were very cheap. Kept them on btc-e because they weren't really worth much (compared to my BTC).Before they were seized (about half a year before) I went to log in and pull them off as the price was up a bit and they were actually worth something.But my account had been frozen due to not logging in for a year. They had a long verification process I had to go through to get logged in. I followed it. I move countries all the time so proof of residence is never easy for me. There was back and forth until they asked for a passport (I had given them my Korean drivers license). Once they saw that I was American all communication stopped. I was in a never ending ("processing") holding pattern.Nothing I can do to get it unlocked. They have everything they need. A few of us are trying to track down the owners. The only way I see getting it back is through not so nice means."You applied for verification. Wait for approval."About a year with that message. The big walls usually indicate the direction the price will go. Toward the wall. Guys, I'm scared with the prices being so low for so long.I feel desperate in these uncertain times. I doubt the next Bitcoin block will clear due to the low price.Yesterday when walking across the street I cut my foot and now there is blood in the street. 
2 days left in the presale to get your bonus varyon.$420 for 14,750 VAR (plus 5% bonus). About 2 cents per varyon. Mark that number for posterity.The pre-sale has been mostly grass roots small investors. The main sale may be a different story.Here are a couple of big names that are supporting Varyon.I'm looking forward to seeing the reaction to the great news we will be presenting for the main sale. Exciting times people. Buckle up. Meanwhile...bitcoin price just went into the gutter.$0 incoming?Maybe the price will go negative (like Swiss banking interest rates)? I wouldn't call the problems with central banking a conspiracy. Any time you go counter to the free market you stifle progress. The central bank has just been around too long.Bitcoin is necessary to bring a bit more freedom back to money. While I don't trust the government and understand that those in power will always want more power, I have a hard time believing in most grand conspiracies. I kept an open mind about 9/11 being an inside job but never saw any evidence that convinced me. One big one for me was when Sarah Palin's personal e-mail was hacked and released to the world. Reading through them it was exactly like you would expect of a candidate running for office...e-mails to various people asking for support and other every day type of stuff. Sure you could say she had some alternative means of communication for talking to her fellow conspirators...but I just don't see it.One of the biggest reasons I don't believe the all powerful government conspiracy is because I've worked for the government for the past 20 years and the incompetence within is mind blowing. It is very much built into the system to reward incompetence. To think that anyone involved in the government is an evil mastermind would require that they be a mastermind in the first place...and they just do not exist. And if they do, the motivation is to go into private industry where that is rewarded.I'm not saying I'm not smart, but I acknowledge that I'm one of the laziest people you'd ever meet (at least after 20 years in government). I likely would not have done very well in the private sector. Or rather, I may have done better starting out in that sector. I realized early on that productivity is definitely not rewarded. Staying under the radar and having the right buzzwords in your resume is all you need. I also claimed to be a Native American (which I am...born and raised). Bitcoin died. I read it in an online news article.The price is under $10k.  Seriously, just read through this thread to find the amount of people that have tried to verify their account after getting locked out.You will lose your coins on WEX.We EXit (with your money). I have 21,000 NMC on WEX.I've tried so hard to get them off the exchange but have come to accept that I will never get them back. Umm...you can download the files used to 3D print a gun... 3 days left in the pre-sale.2298 raised so farI will say that after hearing some great things coming down the line that the soft cap will be hit when we go live with the public sale. This thing is going to happen no matter what.I think the public sale will come with some awesome surprises and we will likely hit the hard cap before it's over.Get in now, not so that you have some bonus coins that you can sell right after they go onto an exchange. But because you will want to hold those coins and spend them on the seastead when they are built.If you want just a taste of what you will be able to enjoy from your seastead, here is a video I did of dolphins playing right outside my back yard this past week:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmmMaH5Dih4 I left a comment saying the Bitcoin doesn't need the antiquated SEC and they should take the application and shove it up their old crusty asses.I hope that helps.Moon soon? 2200 and rising....4 days left in the pre-saleI just spent a day on a floating platform in the lagoon of Tahiti this weekend (during a storm). I find it funny that I was reading an article after that and the commenters were saying that the proposed seasteads would be wiped out by storms or attacked by pirates. Meanwhile, people have been having parties on this floating platform in Tahiti for years.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Cqf94FSXg&feature=youtu.be https://lightninglist.co/ Uh oh...looks like bitcoin is still under $10k Did someone delete the blockchain? Wish I could withdrawal my coins  I guess they need to trickle a few to keep the appearance of a normal exchange. At 2090 ETH today.Only 5 days left in the pre-sale at varyon.ioGreat article on Bitcoinist about various future cities where crypto will be the main currency:https://bitcoinist.com/future-utopias-in-a-blockchain-world/Please share. Maybe because you'll never get your coins off of the exchange? Reminds me of that gorilla who used sign language to tell humans the garbage that his handlers fed him his whole life. Actuarally....the largest amount of bitcoins is not actually 21 million...that last .00000...00001 BTC is never reached. btw, we just passed 2000 ETH! Half way to the soft cap (even with ETH price going up).For those wondering how to participate, this article shows step by step how to do it:https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/how-to-participate-in-the-varyon-ico-43d4857b5a8f6 days left in the pre-sale...don't miss out on that 15% bonus!

FYI, Blue Frontiers...the company I am volunteering for (not my company) has been around for 1 year. The Seasteading Institute has been around for 10 years. Blue Frontiers branched off of The Seasteading Institute last year because TSI is non-profit and this project requires a company that can make money.You talk about what "I have not learned", but don't point out what was to be learned other than categories. We happen to have experts in every field related to this including "waste/resource analysis" (ever sat through a 3 hour presentation on poop? There are people who are very interested in this....do I go into a 3 hour presentation on waste in quick posts about the company to the public? no).This is all off the shelf technology. We're not trying to do anything super extreme, just take existing technology and put it together in one place floating on a calm lagoon.As for moneygrab, the token sale returns everyone's money if we do not raise enough. The founders' money is locked for 4 years (it would be pretty worthless in 4 years if they don't actually accomplish anything.Your posts are ignorant and show that you have not been involved in anything related to seasteading (just how I know someone doesn't understand Bitcoin when they call it bit coin) or this project otherwise you would not be making these false claims. Thus your "help" would only consist of trying to get you up to speed and we are literally turning away volunteers every week because so many people are enthusiastic about the project but the time to get them up to speed and lack of new input they have doesn't make it worth it. We only bring in experts in their various fields.I have no idea where you get the "5 years" thing from. I worked on a project a few years ago consulting for their Internet connectivity, I posted here once when they felt it was time to raise money, but that was a small team. We raised less that $1k and gave the money back when we realized it wasn't going to happen (I put in $10k myself to pay for web development and those glossy pictures...you know, those things that help to put what we are talking about into visual form so people have a better idea of what we are talking about). If you don't like glossy pictures you should read the boring white paper that has no images: https://www.blue-frontiers.com/whitepaper.pdfEither way, you can blather on the same response and disappear like before about how "I (personally) haven't learned" something or another which you won't tell me (because it's a secret), even though I'm not running this company. Very useful. Thanks for the input. But the project is going through whether you support it or not. The soft cap is almost raised so we'll have a platform in the water which we can then use to pay for more even if we don't hit the hard cap. The token contract is written for all to see (hint: Notice that there's no line in there about moneygrab). The company has been open and transparent with everything even more than most companies will ever be. They've recorded all the meetings over the past year to ensure we have a record of everything. They have paid 3rd party companies to do an economic impact study and an environmental analysis. They are partnered with a company that is literally building floating platforms right now, which is the main thing they will be doing in French Polynesia.Please, if there is something that I, personally, have not learned about seasteading after being involved for 10 years, after admining the seateading forums reading every person's post (opinion) after being involved in 2 projects where that's all we talk about is seasteading and the challenges we have to face (waves and pirates, I know... ). Please fill me in. Instead of "hint: water/wet". Seriously, thanks to Bitcoin I'm retired living in Tahiti with plenty of time on my hands (though I'm not going to take marine engineering courses like a friend of mine on the project is doing in his spare time).I suspect that when I am posting from the seastead you will be responding with your "you still haven't learned!" posts. Which is fine. I look forward to it. Some people truly don't ever learn. While many dream of buying a lambo with their bitcoins, some are dreaming of seasteads The common meme within the bitcoin world whenever the price starts heading north, in addition to pictures of rockets, trains and the moon is the idea that the ultimate prize for hodlers is buying a lambo.That may be the dream of past price increases but it may soon be replaced by a new prize for these crypto enthusiasts. A futuristic home on a seastead. Where decentralization of atoms meets decentralization of bits. The utopian dream of leaving your current government and joining others to start a new one in a fully decentralized way.While once reserved for dreamers and sci-fi fans, seasteading appears to be finally happening. A spin off of The Seasteading Institute, Blue Frontiers, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the government of French Polynesia which allows Blue Frontiers to begin building their initial pilot project in one of French Polynesias protected lagoons to begin building as soon as 2022.Continued at:http://bitcoingirlthailand.com/2018/07/08/forget-the-lambo-some-bitcoin-hodlers-are-buying-their-future-homes-on-seasteads/ Were almost past the half way mark for the soft cap until the price of ETH shot up  Looks like the big investors are starting to get involved this final week.Only 6 days left.Please like and share this Youtube video to help out.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCu4IuSmvc&feature=youtu.be At one point I realized that my Thai girlfriend was richer than most American women I would ever date even though she barely makes $1k a month and has nothing. She also has no huge debt weighing her down. People in the third world countries that don't have access to debt are richer than people in the first world.Let that sink in. 7 days left in the pre-sale.We've surpassed 1000 in our ETH wallet. We're at 1990 ETH overall. It's starting to pick up steam these last days of the pre-sale.If you still haven't had the chance to buy, here is a link to help you with setting up a wallet:https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/how-to-create-an-eth-wallet-to-hold-varyon-57551fae3c4f  I have nothing against Ver. I don't support Bcash now solely because it did not catch on and the more dominant won out. No need to work every angle to change that from happening. If there is a better way to raise the block size I believe it will present itself among the devs. Not through hype. Before the split my only hope was that it did not hurt Bitcoin overall, whichever side worked out.I even helped him out a few weeks ago when some scammer was creating fake roger.ver instagram accounts trying to befriend people and get them to invest in some shitty pyramid scheme. The scammer targeted my gf who's english isn't that great but she handed the phone over to me as she does when people want to talk complicated crypto stuff. I let him know since that's just a shitty thing for anyone and scammers like that should be discouraged.I agree with his voluntarism ideals more than so many others in the crypto world who have come in and shit all over the place. Then again, money changes people. It's hard to become super rich and stay grounded. 8 days left for the pre-sale!Don't forget to follow Blue Frontiers on Facebook so you know when the main sale starts.https://www.facebook.com/BlueFrontiersOfficial/ 9 days left, get in the pre-sale while you still can.Countdown can be found here:https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/varyonAlmost 1900 ETH today. Still under $10k.  So another peek behind the curtain of the ICO world...Most of these ICOs that raised a shitload within seconds of opening up their sale are actually big crypto funds that have all been worked behind the scenes where the majority is the huge fund while they have the last couple of percent from the small investors.Blue Frontiers went into this believing the hype that if your idea is good enough, people will flock to invest in it. Our grassroots effort has gotten us about half way to our soft cap, even while not allowing US and Chinese investors which is pretty decent. We close the pre-sale next week and hopefully we can get some of the big funds to take it from there.While I doubt anyone from these big funds will be my future neighbors, I look forward to the current crop of varyon buyers who saw the vision early on to come live on the new seasteads. In case anyone missed it, the pre-sale ends on July 14.Get in now to get your 5-15% bonus while you still can. If you already pledged, you can add to that and raise a tier to get a higher bonus.1 to 10 ETH: bonus 5%10 to 40 ETH: bonus 10%40 ETH and up: bonus 15%Only 11 days left. Any ideas you have are more than welcome. Some people have been doing personal videos where they tell their reasons for supporting the project.Like this one:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs6Nx6ywfswDefinitely feel free to make your own videos and upload them to Youtube. Blue Frontiers will gladly disseminate them. Bitcoin price still under $10k. Has the chain of blocks failed us all? Also announced are the team lockup times.Team Token LockupBlue Frontiers is allocating 15% of Varyon tokens to the team, which consists of the founders and executives, full and part time staff, more than one hundred professional volunteers, and advisors.All team tokens will be locked for one year from the end of the TGE. Founder tokens will be vested over 4 years. Key employees tokens will be vested over two years.The team will also be required to accept a significant part of their compensation in tokens, from 10% to 40%, and 40% specifically for founders. Payments received until Dec 2021 in year N are locked until the last day of year N+1.The Volunteer team will be allocated approximately one percent of the total token issuance. Volunteer tokens will be locked for one year.Some advisors will be awarded half of their tokens at the close of the sale, with the remaining tokens being vested over the course of one year. Exciting news. The varyonomics has been released and updated in the white paper.This is one of the major updates for the main sale but we are releasing it just before the end of the pre-sale which ends July 14th. So get your ETH in before then to get the 5-15% bonuses.The Varyonomics are described here with full details in the white paper.Some of the main points of the updated varyonomics are that in addition to using varyon as the currency to interact with Blue Frontiers there will be significant amounts of varyon used for staking purposes.Staking means locking away varyon in a smart contract for many different things in the SeaZone.The biggest staking requirement will be the surface occupation stake. Basically any platform or anything occupying space in the SeaZone will need to lock away a set amount of tokens to monopolize a given space. This takes supply out of the market thus creating value. Periodic auctions of monopolized space will ensure that those locations that are most desired lock the highest stake.Staking also allows stakeholders to veto proposals by Blue Frontiers and to amend the SeaZone charter in a weighted heterarchical decision-making process, with length of staking granting somewhat higher weights for the same amount of staked Varyon.One major component is the Vickrey Auctions which will be used for selling major infrastructure such as seastead platforms. Vickrey auctions essentially allow people to bid what they actually want to pay without needing to game the system. What the white paper does not get into which I believe is the most significant part (most likely to get it out before the end of the pre-sale, and it's very complicated so trying to get it into simple terms has been difficult) is the method used to ensure that varyon's value is not depreciated by the auction. I will not butcher the details but it is something like setting the minimum bid amount to all varyon that have been sold (do not quote me on that because it is very complicated and I have not wrapped my head around it enough to put into simple terms yet, which is likely why they did not include the full explanation in the white paper yet).tl;dr: Varyon pre-sale ends July 14. Varyonomics were added to the white paper which give some real value to owning varyon. The added details are what were required by the big funds which are waiting in the wings for us to add these things before they would buy. I can't stand it any more, living in secrecy. I am Satoshi Nakamoto.Here is proof.

This. If as many people that bought bitcoin understood why Bitcoin...things would change quite rapidly.Unfortunately most just watch the price trying to figure out when to get out.  Big jump in price coming in 5....Edit: nvm...usually goes up when I get a big order on LBC. She was some fat financial reporter for the legacy finance system (come to find out).She would come on here with a new account and post pictures of unicorns and naked old men. Constantly. The admins had to play whack a mole with her accounts she was creating banning her over and over and over as she logged into this thread to do the same thing non-stop.The rule was changed so that new accounts could not post pictures until reaching like 2 months of activity.
You missed the last bottom troll that was NotLambChop.She was so bad they had to change the forum policies for new accounts because of her. In this video Tommy Lee is much more interesting and it is only 6 minutes long.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWRYqyRi1yI We used to call them hajjis. It refers to people who have traveled to the Hajj (a ritual of taking a pilgrimage to Mecca). The thing being that it pretty much encompassed all foreigners in Iraq/Afghanistan/etc. even though most of the people working there were Pakistani. One of the commanders sent an e-mail out saying how it was an ignorant slur and to not use it anymore. To which someone asked if we could just call them oompa loompas...  last time I was there the term TCN (third country national) was adopted.The word they have for us is essentially "the jews". I believe the reversal was when we had like 2 months of relative stability in the price. We were less volatile than the Brazilian Real and for a moment we were even more stable than the British Pound. That's a good solid bottom to form the base of the cup for a cup and handle rise. *looking at the price...yep, still $6240...**look away for a few minutes**look at the price again...$6420* These single large pumps are not good indicators of a turnaround. High volume rise over the course of a day would do it. Not a single jump.Bitcoin is still under $10k   The thread did fork:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3386487.msg35480059#msg35480059the forked thread needs some pumps though for us to achieve the flippening I'm afraid...and I loath things.  Price still under $10k...  I'm a bull but I try to hide it to show that we're all scared and in "blood in the streets" mode. I'm not very good at hiding it though.Is this the end of cryptography? Pledges are now up over 1800 ETH. Getting close to the half way mark to 4000.The new varyonomics part of the white paper is finished and just being made pretty now to be released soon.It's in response to a lot of the big funds asking for more meat than just acting as a currency accepted by Blue Frontiers before they start bringing in the large pledges.This July will be very interesting for the project.Personally, after reading the update I want to get as many varyon as I can. Price down...forum full of bcash FUD...I forgot what I was supposed to program my bot to do in this situation. Final indicator will be if I start getting some large buy orders on localbitcoins. Just had to post... All I know is bcash is down to .11 BCH/BTC. I was only selling my bcash at .2 BCH/BTC but may need to re-think that as I doubt it will ever come back and continue to wither away.I'm all for people pumping it to get me more BTC but the more time passes, the less likely some alt coin is going to magically become Bitcoin. With the amount of progress being made with Lightning Network I doubt people would drop it all once mass adoption begins just for slightly bigger blocks.I was agnostic through the whole thing. My hope was that whatever choice was made, that everyone get behind one and we move forward in a disrupting way. The hard fork did not achieve that. I believe that bcash has shown that hard forks will be a very difficult thing to do which I feel is a very good thing. The hard fork should be left for huge emergencies like finding a bug that makes Bitcoin vulnerable to collapse (as was done in the past). Upgrades should be done via soft fork if possible. This ensures that the bitcoin I own today are backed by the same algorithm (or very close to it) decades from now. A recent article I read from a helpful gentleman on here showed me how I can get rich quick (the guy they were talking about made 4,000 BTC and several million dollars).I need to research how to make this thing called Xanax. And figure out this "Dark Web" thing too.The link gives a rundown of all of the things you'll need to run this business. Money counting machine, shotguns, packing materials. So much information provided by that fellow. Good to know there are such nice people out there trying to help out when the price is down. That ichimoku cloud looks promising. Haven't seen a green one for a while. Did a quick and nasty chart to see how things would look if the pattern repeated 2013-2015.If the worst is that we hit a low of $4k and we're back at new highs next year then it's not that bad at all. If there are places with lower taxes for these corporations to flow to...why is doesn't the US just compete and provide the same low taxes for everyone to flow to?Whenever I say we should end taxes all I hear is "what about the roads!?!". Then I hear, "corporations are being big meanies by moving to places with no taxes". To which I say...we should end taxes.The love of government roads (aka the very thing that causes millions of deaths each year) runs deep. The US is creating its own financial instability with the huge debt it continues to ramp up ("Postal Inspectors and their law enforcement partners will spare no resource or expense to shine a light on the sale and distribution of illicit and dangerous items on the Darknet"). Everyone can just sit back and do nothing and it will all come tumbling down.It's just that some of us don't want to be caught in the rubble.Thank you for pointing out that Bitcoin does not need to be regulated, as good old police work can catch people doing bad things with bitcoin the same way they can catch people doing bad things with the dollar ($3.6 million in U.S. currency in the case of the article you posted).Bullish!

Bottom of the cup needs a good level base. The way Waves DEX handles fiat trades is through a central bank. Looked a bit more into hodlhodl and it is a centralized site like localbitcoins but they use multi-sig wallets instead of holding your coins which is a decent improvement. My main reason behind all of this is because I currently live in a country that has a banking oligopoly (only 3 banks) which have basically forbidden any bitcoin exchanges from using their services (I've talked to a bitcoin supporter who works for the bank about this). People have to wire their money to another country, pay the horrible wire fees and currency conversion rates to buy bitcoins.Most people globally that do p2p like on localbitcoins do so by charging a fee (a few percent) on top of the current price, then they go buy the bitcoins back on the exchange at a better rate. The airport has said they would accept a bitcoin ATM but again, if you cannot convert the fiat back into bitcoins or vice versa then you are stuck with one currency or the other building up over time due to demand. The currency exchange at the airport charges 15% to convert currencies. The banks charge 20%.If there was an in-between cryptofiat then locals could buy/sell the cryptofiat without risk of volatility while making money with fees. Once their money is in cryptofiat then they can day trade for bitcoin as much as they want. Sure they might do bank transfers or physical cash transactions but at the individual level the banks can't stop it. I have sold locally on localbitcoins but I am the only listing. I only sell to get some cash for local purchases, but if someone wanted a high volume I would not be interested because it is too hard for me to turn it back into bitcoins. Ok, I read through TenX which appears more promise than offering solutions. The network relies on their COMIT protocol. The COMIT protocol seems to be reliant on these magical "Liquidity Providers". Which essentially, as it says in the white paper, are the centralized exchanges. It appears to be trying to organize the exchanges a bit more like nodes on a network but it essentially relies heavily on these nodes to handle the fiat to crypto exchange. Whether or not that allows for decentralization down the road or not, possibly. But their solution focuses more on what happens after that is taken care of rather than working on that particular piece.I like Bisq, have downloaded it and put up some BTC for sale on it. It's like localbitcoins but through a decentralized app. There is a mechanism for arbitration set up which is where the developer plans on making the money via his token. Anyone with the token can be an arbitrator. Also, only the couple of developers have those tokens.It is certainly a good p2p solution, the low volume is no fault of the platform. I did not like that I had to keep the program running on my PC to keep my listing up but I understand the reason. Unfortunately the program was taking up too much CPU on my machine.HodlHodl looks like a cleaner version of bisq, I just started checking it out so I will give my thoughts on it after checking under the hood. Exactly. Trading P2P for a fiat pegged crypto would allow for onboarding but then allow for decentralized trading from crypto to crypto from there. Give me a call when that era of laissez faire rampant capitalism starts instead of the socialist/communist system we're currently under. Also, since everyone is throwing out conspiracy theories...here's one I cooked up.CoInbAsehmmm... ? ? ? Nice to see that 49% are in for spending and changing the world.Judging from reddit and forum posts it seemed like anyone coming in the past year was just in it for lambo and more fiat.Here's to hoping that is true. Thank you. I will check these out. Localbitcoins and more decentralized bisq can already do this.Having thousands of people exchanging physical cash for crypto is not centralized. Everything you keep saying seems to ignore the fact that localbitcoins exists and is very prevalent all over the world. This is what traditional financial instruments and institutions are financed by: I'm not really caring about a decentralized exchange of BTC for shitcoins. Was focused more on fiat <-> BTC. The fiat pegged currency would certainly need to use Lightning Network and allow for atomic swaps. The problem with p2p exchanges like localbitcoins and bisq is that you have to wait for someone to buy or sell at the price you're looking to buy or sell at, you can't day trade and take advantage of the fluctuations like you can on a centralized exchange. P2P is good for getting money in or money out of BTC but it's not a good trading platform.Anonymity is not the point (though try to track someone's localbitcoins purchase back to them). The main problem to solve is the centralization of exchanges who hold a shit-ton of bitcoins and fiat which can be over-regulated, hacked, held ransom, etc. (ie: btc-e, MtGox, poloniex, etc.).These centralized exchanges use centralized bank accounts which subjects them to the whims of those banks. Having thousands of bank accounts across the country owned by individuals selling small amounts of crypto is harder to stop than a single bank account. Even in Germany where they essentially outlawed exchanges (it is legal but in order to be compliant it's essentially impossible) it is still perfectly legal for an individual to sell their private asset to another individual (like selling your car online). Even if it becomes illegal it just goes underground like in places like Venezuela.  Something where you do a p2p exchange of fiat to a fiat pegged crypto (on something like bisq) and then trade the pegged crypto for BTC in the same way you do on an exchange (on something like Bancor). Welcome to retirement. That totally sucks. Banks and governments are not only inefficient, they are incompetent.I was in Thailand, sent a package to French Polynesia (through the government post office). Checked the tracking number and the package arrived...in Paris (hint: Paris is not in French Polynesia).I wish that whenever dealing with those institutions I could just manually do every step for them. I have been working on a decentralized fiat exchange but would like to know if any other work is being put forth toward this.I know of bisq but that is p2p which is not what I'm looking for. So what is this, bankers coming onto a bitcoin forum to revel in the Bitcoin doom?Too much time on your hands with people not opening enough accounts or something? Or just waiting for your money to move from one place to another for days? The calculation was based on around $600/ETH. But they may hold off on payments until the price comes back or collateralize. It's a double edged sword. The lower the ETH price, the easier it is to hit the soft cap. But the lower price means less dollar value. The big spending will be in a few years though with the construction, after the Bitcoin halving in 2020 so the price will be much higher at that point.
Sell now and catch the falling knife!1! Time to polish the old resume. Satoshi save us! They paint the world full of shadows, and then tell their children to stay close to the light. Their light. Their reasons, their judgments. Because in the darkness, there be dragons.But it isn't true.We can prove that it isn't true.In the dark there is discovery, there is possibility, there is freedom in the dark when someone has illuminated it. Definitely, though they won't be raising more through ICOs for the next seasteads. The way I see it is, I'm buying enough varyon right now for my first house. That way it is highly likely that I will have enough or more when I can make my first purchase. If you're looking for a pump (to the moon) and dump coin, this is not one of those. It is "long term" compared to most ICOs out today. Building will not start for a few years so any price rise would be gradual. Varyon will also be used for everything else on the seastead that has to go through Blue Frontiers, not just purchases. Since Blue Frontiers will be the administrator of the SeaZone they will be doing things like registering property, taking care of residency, issuing passports, etc. all which require varyon.There are a few more varynomics being worked on which sorta blew me away on the implications for the value but I will wait until the lawyer filtered version of the white paper is released to say anything about it. Yes, I may need to go and search again. What I tend to find is the cheap, high capacity sites don't allow me to do hardly anything on their server except run their Cpanel type of apps. Instead of install my own version of Linux, ssh in and set up my own access controls.Though I've been using this server for 5 years so ya...likely due for an upgrade.Would love to hear about some of these cheap, large hard drive VPSs out there though if someone wants to share. I have come to understand that gold bugs made up this whole list of criteria to define what something needs to be considered money (fungibility, divisibility, can wear it as a necklace, etc.) to conveniently fit all of the characteristics of precious metals.Money is simply what people agree to use as a medium of exchange to replace bartering. That is all.There are certainly characteristics that make one form of money preferable, but it does not change the fact that it is money. You had huge rocks that could not be moved that were considered money. Shells were considered money. Metals were considered money. Paper was considered money.It helps if each of these has the same value which makes it easier to trade. It helps if you can have larger and smaller denominations. It helps if you can pay someone over long distances. It helps if you do not need to pay a lot to secure it. It helps if it's easy to trade from one person to another.But what it ultimately comes down to is, will someone accept it or not. I'll give that a shot. *Checks the price**still less than 5 figures*Not started yet. Tried to install LN node on my server but I have to run a full node. My server only has 200 Gb.Is there a preferred way among people without home servers? Either most people know this is a long term token so it's not a pump and dump, or most new people are on the telegram channel where questions can be asked and answered in real time. Shit's about to get real. Not sure if it's any indicator at all but my gf's localbitcoins sales have been up.Though it could just be the new program I wrote to push her to the top of the list.Several 100k baht trades today (about $3k each) with one guy asking if she can do 400k, settling for 100k because all her money was back on the exchange.Usual trades are usually a few around 10-20k per day. I will not feel right until the price is over $10k. For some reason when it is over I am calm. This low price makes me sad.   If you are watching the adoption rate on varyon.io you will see that the amount has been close to 1550 for quite a while. However adoption has been picking up. The BTC/ETH rate affects the total because we have significant BTC stores but as ETH gains against BTC the calculation shows we have "less ETH". eg. Say we have 100 BTC and ETH is .1 BTC/ETH then we would calculate that we have 1000 ETH. If ETH jumped to 1 ETH/BTC we would calculate that we have 100 ETH (as an extreme example) worth of BTC.If you look at just our ETH wallet (ignoring our BTC and ZEN holdings) you can see that outside of price, the adoption is increasing.ETH Balance this past week and this past month Times like these I envy those that still have paychecks coming in.I would be doing like I did all through 2015-16...100% paycheck to bitcoin through BitWage. I'm not spiritually prepared for the 6K range. At the moment I'm in Thailand with my girlfriend*. I'm bringing her back with me to Tahiti this week.I do recommend to all Americans that women outside of the US are soooo much better.Brazilian, Eastern European, Vietnamese, Thai....all good stuff.At one point I went with a new gal each million I was up...with the price going down I'll stick with Thai.*I know what you're thinking...not a ladyboy (there is more to Thailand than ladyboys)If anyone here is in Thailand...I'm heading to the Sathoshi Square(?) meetup in BKK this evening.  Is there any information out there on Coinbase's new user sign ups? So...I think the big question now is....is the bear run this time around like 2013or 2014-2015Or will this be totally unique?
Bitcoin is the path to lambo. Lambo leads to women. Women lead to marriage. Marriage leads to...suffering. I never accept any dollars with the numbers 666 on it. Because satan.Thus. The dollar is not fungible. There are tons of plastic on land. Maybe that could be burned for electricity before trying to get the nano-particles from the ocean. Oh no...Berlin maybe, but I was near Frankfurt...the headquarters for the EU and ECB. Germany made bitcoin a "private money" which is all well and good (Germany acknowledges that bitcoin is a currency! Yay!) except now it is essentially considered a foreign currency when it comes to being able to set up an exchange. That comes with all of the legal difficulty that comes with setting up a foreign exchange. That's why there's really no exchange in Germany and localbitcoins was shut out. For me, selling bitcoins as a private individual was fine because it would be like me selling a gold coin or a personal item.I left Germany for that wonderful place called Afghanistan. Not so crypto friendly. Blue Frontiers Partners with Kleros to Provide Blockchain Justice on Floating Seastead CommunitiesThe companies will work towards integrating decentralised arbitration into the governance of Seastead communities to resolve disputes relating to virtually any product or service.Kleros is a decision-making protocol which uses blockchain and crowdsourcing for adjudicating claims. The platform connects users who need to solve disputes with jurors who have the skills to fairly settle them. The system relies on incentives backed by the game theoretical concept of Schelling point in order to motivate anonymous jurors to rule cases correctly. Kleros means chance in Greek. The system is based in some principles for random jury selection which were known by the Athenians twenty five centuries ago. The result is a peer-to-peer justice system able to solve the disputes of the Internet age in a fast, transparent and inexpensive way.More here:https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/blue-frontiers-partners-with-kleros-to-provide-blockchain-justice-on-floating-seastead-communities-57344284d73cI think this is awesome. Dispute resolution on the blockchain will be a great addition to seasteading, hopefully eliminating that portion of governance that costs a lot of money for governments currently. I left Germany in 2016, I think Bitwala stopped working after I left. After I had my landlord start accepting BTC directly the only thing I used Bitwala for was paying my many speeding tickets.It was...sorta. After I used it for getting cash to buy a car I started selling BTC on localbitcoins. Then Germany "banned" it. What actually happened was that they blocked people connecting from German IP addresses. And they locked all of the German listings so you could no longer create new ads or edit your old ones.What this ended up doing was it created a monopoly for me in my area at a high rate of return. While there was competition in the US driving down rates close to a few percent, I had a few ads going from 10% to 15% per trade. I actually only wanted to get a little spending money and spread the word of BTC but having such a monopoly and high rate of return I continued selling, immediately putting the money back into bitcoins after the trade. The Germans knew how to use VPNs.For Amazon I use purse.io for the discount (I had an APO address in Germany, but there was also a way to get stuff at 15% discount on amazon.de).For gift cards there is gyft.com and egifter.com. I prefer egifter because you can get your gift card very close to the dollar amount you are spending.They have 100s of retailers from most chain restaurants to most chain clothing stores. Most peoples' taxes are taken out of their paycheck. With BitWage you can get your paycheck direct deposited to a bitcoin address without your company ever knowing you are getting paid in bitcoin.In Europe I was able to pay bills, rent (until I talked my landlord into taking BTC directly), etc. with bitwala. Not sure if there is a similar service in the US but a quick google search gives welto.io, coinbills.com and coinsfer.com.Buy houses? Something done how often? Every 5 years maybe? Buy a used car with bitcoin or go to the very few auto dealers in the US that accept BTC (again, what...every 5 years? are you holding fiat so you can buy a car?). When I wanted a car in Germany I went to a localbitcoins guy and got the cash to pay for the car. Groceries? Whole Foods, Walmart, Target(do they have groceries?).Gas? Walmart. Restaurant? Buffalo Wild Wings.Everything else? Amazon.I just know the couple of times I visited the US since converting to bitcoin it was sooooo easy.Or are you waiting to only use bitcoin when the store you go to has a QR code? Or perhaps they need to make it easier?Trust me, when you only have bitcoin to spend. You'll find ways to pay for just about everything. (Oh nos! I have to buy a gift card! That's not bitcoin! It allows you to have bitcoin as your main currency and not rely on banks or holding fiat that loses value over time, take the 3% discount through gift cards already). It can be.At least that's the way I treated it which allowed me to have almost 95% of my money in bitcoins.I was able to live on bitcoin in Germany where it's damned hard. If you can't live on bitcoin in the US you're not trying. Meh, I'm not a big fan of the idea of hodling so that you can sell later.For me I wish people would convert and spend rather than buy, hodl, sell.The idea of holding means you're resisting the temptation of selling. But if bitcoin is your main currency...why would you ever consider buying some fiat? 2014:Today: I'm not sure if Mark has invested. Sounds like he is someone who likes the idea behind Varyon  We hit 2000 followers on Telegram.https://t.me/bluefrontierscommunity How is producing 10 times the amount of money you have...not printing money out of thin air?If not out of thin air, where does the new money come from? Never trust a college professor when it comes to Bitcoin.They are the very very least knowledgeable about Bitcoin in all of the world. They don't just not understand it, their brains believe the opposite of it. You know the signature campaigners must have taken over the rest of bitcointalk if theymos is finally retreating to this thread too. Seems legit. We already saw that it was a false breakout. It dipped below just enough time to wait for the big sell-off but people didn't bite.Definitely bullish. I will just leave this here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdOt7UUAPiQ  All of the Youtubes and professional investors are telling me I should sell.Has anyone heard what Goldman Sachs is suggesting? If they're saying sell then I'm definitely dumping it all. The US is all over the scale. Rural cities can be very cheap. Big cities are super expensive.
I am currently in Thailand. The 3 bedroom house I'm staying at costs $400 per month in rent. Shared with roomates you could be spending $200 for all of your living expenses and then food would be about another $1-200 per month.Cambodia and Vietnam are even cheaper.I will be going back to Tahiti next week. My rent is around $1300 per month in a house shared with 4 people. Food is incredibly expensive. I usually don't pay attention to prices for food since I don't spend money on hardly anything else so I am willing to spend on the best quality of food. But I glanced at a receipt after going to the store one day and saw that I paid like $20 for a pack of 4 chicken breasts (big organic ones, but still). In the US I usually buy packs of chicken because chicken is so cheap. So I'm definitely spending at least $2k per month there. That's not counting car and expensive gas...I'll likely buy a scooter when I get back. Countdown to the first story of someone who commits suicide due to the price drop. Morbid and sad, but you know it's coming.  If there is anyone out there thinking about it, remember...you have a brain. You can continue to make money in the future. You don't need stuff. Think of it as a fresh start. The presale is now open to accredited US investors. Game over for any type of ATH between now and halving.Do not mind the capitulation talk...showing the blood on the streets is a good thing. We go under $6k and I'm calling it. Game over.We may actually need to go through the same 2 year down time like the last two times so that when we get back to ATH again people aren't selling all of their coins so they can "break even". Need to shake them all out before we can move forward.I was worried then I remembered I am a minimalist...I only need money for food and rent for the next 2 years. Meanwhile...for all those selling... Bonuses 5%  1-10 ETH 10%  10-40 ETH 15%  40+ ETHThere is a max amount...about 20k ETH in case you were contemplating such an investment.Announcements coming out this week: some clarification on several of the things that will be done with varyon to ensure the token maintains (or gains) in value. We should be all set with accepting US accredited investors. And I believe they will be able to announce the new country we incorporated in.Also the lock-in times for the founders. This thread or the telegram channel.https://t.me/bluefrontierscommunityBut I should be able to respond to most of your questions here. Bonus is only during presale.Highest bonus is 15% with 40 ETH.  My retirement went from living on the beach in Tahiti with the price over $10k. Then living in Thailand under 10k. Now I'm on a ratty old bus on my way to Cambodia.Not many countries cheaper than Cambodia. Please don't drop any further. Economical Analysis and Environmental Impact Report (among other things) can be found here:https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/docsThe whitepaper can be read here:https://www.blue-frontiers.com/whitepaper.pdfAs for waste, there are experts involved in the project that are far more understanding of it than I could even attempt to explain (I didn't know there were people that were so passionate about poop).It's almost as if different people are competing over the different ways to turn waste into fuel. Who will win out? Food systems using it for fertilizer? Energy systems using it for methane, biodigester(?).It is still in the works but we are looking to recycle as much as possible. The hope is that people will start using local traditions of using palm branches for bags and such. We're not going in blind, the locals have been living on these islands for centuries so they can show us a thing or two about not impacting the environment. I couldn't quite make out the numbers this morning when I saw the price. It didn't seem real. French Polynesia has no income taxes. But for the Special Economic Zone we will be asking for more economic freedom.France is actually working toward becoming very crypto friendly. They have been listening to the Bitcoin community there and are trying to work with them.https://news.bitcoin.com/vive-la-france-bitcoin-tax-slashed-by-republic/"During this weeks G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Frances minister of Finance Bruno Le Maire highlighted the importance bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may have in the worlds economy."https://www.ccn.com/french-minister-bruno-le-marie-highlights-importance-of-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies/ The presale minimums have been updated. You can now get in on the presale with 1 ETH with 5% bonus. Pretty much. We are encouraging many blockchain companies to come and use the seastead as an incubator site.I know some people might not participate but I think the types of people who move onto a seastead will likely be ok with trying new blockchain products even if it's not "point and click" or super simple. It will be an adventure in experimentation in all manner of ways. Yes, I agree this is a very good assessment. The criticisms are legit as those are certainly risks for token holders.I will clear up a few things though.Peter Thiel only donated $500k toward the initial formation of the Seasteading Institute. That money was long gone before anyone who works for Blue Frontiers came on board. I believe the $1.7 million number might be a total from the 10 years the institute has been around.We only put 2 names on the list of advisors from the blockchain team but there are at least a dozen of us participating, we just don't have as big names as people like Daniel Nagy and Robert Viglione. We had Ross Kenyon advising early on, he was in charge of marketing for Tezos which raised over $100 million. We had a conference call with Vitalik who chimed in on his suggestions for possible blockchain solutions on the seastead. We spoke with more experts in the industry than can be named and would have had this up and running back in August if it was a straight forward utility token. But once you start looking at this thing from a legal perspective, it gets complicated very quickly. The team did well to get their ducks in a row before doing the ICO. We actually started earlier than we wanted to but knew we needed to get this going.Which is the reason the White Paper is still in draft form. I'm not sure how public knowledge this is but they should be bringing something up this week. We have been in the process of moving from being based in Singapore to a more crypto friendly country. The white paper cannot be in its final form until the team of lawyers in that country get through with it and make sure it complies with their laws. The team lock up amounts are close to being determined. It is a bit complicated because the "team" consists of mostly staff while the founders are a very small percentage of that. Talk I have heard was there will be a large amount locked up for a year. You can see the smart contract already reserves a space for locked coins so it is definitely planned.Of course the biggest factor is certainly whether or not Blue Frontiers will build a seastead and I definitely agree, this is the biggest question. The money raised during the ICO will certainly not go toward any research into SeaZones. That has already been well established and we submitted our legislative package to French Polynesia back in September with our requests for what we will need. There is no more money needed on that front. Money will definitely be going toward engineering. The initial designs are already pretty far along, that has been paid for as well. But the designs need to go through prototyping and get the final logistics set up for determining the path forward for getting these seasteads to the SeaZone (how much to build on site, whether to build off site then assemble on site, etc.). As a seed investor who has been involved in seasteading for 10 years I made sure to meet up with the team to look them in the eyes to see if they had the conviction to actually build seasteads. That has also been my biggest frustration with seasteading for the past 10 years...seeing projects that went nowhere. After all of this time I believe that this is right team to get this done. I have been nothing but impressed by all of the very smart people involved in this project.To ensure that they do actually get these things built I retired back in November and moved to Tahiti. I am living with one of the founders, Marc Collins (along with a few other housemates) and have been kept up to date on everything as we move forward. I plan on going out to the various sites on my own dime, surveying the sites as much as I can on my own to contribute what I can to this project. I even got SCUBA certified a few months ago and bought some underwater equipment so I can do what I can to assist in mapping out the location underwater while also buying a drone to do some aerial shots. I should be heading out next month to get started on checking a few of the sites.This is going to happen. It's beyond the point where it will be just science fiction or fantasy. We are shovel ready and once that SeaZone legislation passes we'll be on the ground within days getting things started. Even with the money raised already we could probably get to the point where we just pay for each platform with pre-sales (worst case scenario, if funding dries up...but it seems to be picking up lately). It is no longer about "I hope it happens"...it's happening people. Start preparing. In Germany Bitcoin is considered a private money. Exchanging bitcoins is akin to exchanging foreign currency.In order to set up a bitcoin exchange in Germany you need to get the several hundred thousand euro foreign exchange license just to get started.They block localbitcoins because they consider it an exchange. They're in talks but of course not until after the sale. Varyon will be the only currency that Blue Frontiers accepts. So even if ZenCash is being used for some blockchain solution, if it interacts with Blue Frontiers it will need to convert to varyon at some point.Blue Frontiers will want to keep the value of varyon up because it holds a lot of varyon in reserves and will use it for future construction all over the world. Yes, I believe they are doing several podcasts hoping to keep it a regular thing.
ZenCash is very much focused on decentralized governance so they should be able to build some of the governance tools for the seasteads. I know they are working on a private voting system. As I have mentioned before, Blue Frontiers is not a blockchain company...it is a seastead building company. So they will be looking to partner with others to take care of many of the blockchain based solutions to governance. ZEN has a setup where they pay developers like how Bitcoin pays miners. So if some of the developers are getting paid for projects that can be used on the seastead then that is beneficial to all seasteaders. Of course there will need to be built a simple interaction between varyon and ZEN so that people with ZEN can use their tools. My gf trades on localbitcoins and I sometimes help her to set the price to buy back after a sale.Last Friday we were about to leave for the weekend so I set the price low, to about the monthly low.I said, if it hits that price then you made some decent money. But if it never hits that price again I'll be very happy.When it didn't hit the low over the weekend I loaned her a BTC to keep trading on LBC. Fortunately living in Thailand her expenses aren't that high so she can live just on LBC sales.If the price drops again she'll be back to using her own money and growing her BTC stash. Hopefully we can figure out a better way on the seasteads  Thanks. We have worked with a lot of the crypto industry from top lawyers to various ICO companies who have tried to wrap their heads around the complexity of this project (foreign company with founders living all over the world where the company will be building all over the world allowing investment from all over the world...etc.) but we feel that we have been able to get all of our ducks in a row for the token. Fortunately the project has received a lot of media attention and is gaining a lot of interest so it is certainly viable that the project will move forward. Likely not unless their laws change. They outright outlawed ICOs. KYC is Know Your Customer. Basically verifying your identity.AML is Anti-Money Laundering. Basically finding out where the money is coming from.I would speak freely about what I think about KYC/AML but I am somewhat representing Blue Frontiers so I will play nice. I have been involved with Blue Frontiers who is building seasteads and they keep talking about recycled materials and environmentally friendly building methods. I'm not involved in that part of things so I don't know the details. My participation is mainly on the blockchain side of things.The seastead ICO is already underway with the presale going right now at http://www.varyon.io Edit: Sorry...realized I'm likely quoting a sock puppet that everyone else had the sense to ignore already. One quoting of the troll this month is more than I would have liked. Choose your life forward. You only get one. Out of curiosity, what would you do with your life if the joos are no longer the boogyman?Seriously? It is something I contemplated myself with my hatred for the state and the amount of time I spent of my life fighting for liberty. Only to realize that so much of my life was wasted fighting for something nobody else really wants.What's on the other side of victory? For me I am discovering that. What is it I am fighting for? What, in my own life, is being restricted by the evil government?The reality is I can find freedom in my own life and not worry about them. I can move forward in my own life and have that future on my own. I can focus on the things I'd wanted to do before getting caught up in the whole political game. Sure, the knowledge of how things work has helped in my decision making, but I don't have to be a warrior for "the cause". I can be a warrior for my self. Has anyone else noticed the distinct rise in communism (or whatever the current name is for it, progressive, democratic socialist, etc.) on the Internet lately? Even on reddit crypto forums where they're supporting something that will take away power from the state...it is like a virus.Perhaps it is just the reaction to the crumbling economies and everyone is looking for a safety net. Blaming capitalism for the mess the governments have created.I can only hope to make it to the last refuge on a seastead using crypto before it engulfs the rest of the world. Accredited investors will be going through a separate KYC/AML process that also involves proving their accredited status (they have to have made at least $200k in the past 2 years or have at least $1 million in assets). If we can't colonize the water, how are we supposed to concur space? Sustainable refers to working toward being resource independent from a supply route. At first most things will be a hybrid approach, perhaps utilizing current resources on the host island or atoll.The plan is to be energy independent, recycle our own waste, gather and store our own water, create our own food, etc.While we won't be making our own computers or having herds of cattle for steaks, we hope to reach the point where someone could live on the seastead without the need of anything from outside of the seastead. Of course, for more pleasurable living we would rely on trade.This has big implications for things like growing populations or refugees. During the Syrian refugee crisis there was a very rich man that wanted to spend millions to buy an island for the refugees. If we can create a sustainable floating island where anyone living there has all the resources they need to live, then it will solve a lot of the world's problems.We acknowledge that food will be the most difficult starting out but the rest should be possible early on. Correct. Like every other ICO there is the risk that the company won't follow through.Blue Frontiers is holding a majority of varyon in reserves. They have the largest stake in making this happen so they are incentivized to make it happen.Most ICOs try to get all of the money up front with the promise that they'll get around to building what they promised (as they drive around in their lambos). The small upfront raise of varyon ensures that Blue Frontiers will do everything it can to ensure that the value of the varyon holds in the long term. Seasteads would be great in such an island nation such as Greece.We are having a contest right now paying $100k to find the next seastead location.https://www.blue-frontiers.global/ Blue Frontiers has partnered with ZenCash. A major focus of their cryptocurrency is blockchain based governance solutions and privacy. I am not a ZenCash expert so I can't comment much on the technology but hopefully their team can provide some governance solutions for the seastead. We definitely want to partner with many blockchain players to provide blockchain based solutions to things that governments currently do centrally. Blue Frontiers is not a blockchain business so they will be looking to others to solve these problems for the seastead.  Here's one of our founders, Randy Hencken with Robert Viglione discussing Blue Frontiers and ZenCash.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52InKG3PmAw During this slow period in bitcoin's price, it is time to move forward again.So sayeth the Antanopolis.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xIq0FdmsIA During the presale we accept BTC, ETH and ZEN. During the actual sale we will be using the smart contract for purchase which will only allow for sending ETH. Soft cap is 4000 ETH.This week we will start opening up for accredited US investors so that should bump things up fairly quickly.
Ya, sounds like the guy wants to launch small satellites into orbit. Something that can be used repeatedly for something like the global satellite internet initiative. So I had lunch with a guy last week in Bangkok who is working on a prototype for an electromagnetic launch vehicle in the ocean.Why the ocean? Because his final product will be 2km in diameter. Sure you could dig a deep hole to get it to work or you just take the tube and let it sit deep in the ocean.He wanted to talk to me because of the seasteading connection. He's not like one of the many dreamers I meet in the seasteading world, he is already funding the prototype himself and has it built, transporting it to the ocean this week. The prototype will be 50 meters in diameter with a 10cm wide tube launching at about 300 m/s.We discussed it and said it would be a great business for seasteaders since you'll need people maintaining and keeping an eye on the structure. Though he prefers Thailand due to the cheap labor. There is a ticker on the website, varyon.ioCurrently at 1381 ETH (varies based on the price of our bitcoin holdings). There are several. https://rentberry.com/ is one.Blue Frontiers wants to partner with as many blockchain companies as possible to make the seastead as blockchain friendly as they can. Using things like Rentberry for rentals, others for crypto voting, property registration, citizenship, etc...They're not a blockchain company so they will definitely be looking for partners to utilize their unique environment for testing their new projects and getting the word out about the results. I have very little faith in fiat currencies and definitely do not keep more than 5-10% in them at any one time. What country is stable enough to hold their fiat? Even investments denominated in fiat are still subject to the inflationary nature of the underlying fiat.If you look at the US, they are currently $20 trillion in debt with over $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities (meaning, future promised money will not be able to be paid by future taxes). The payment per year in just the interest on the debt is around $300 billion. The defense budget is one of the highest expenditures at $600 billion. Eventually the interest on the debt will be higher than defense spending. The only way to keep paying it will be to borrow more which makes the interest payment higher going into a debt spiral.The only way out of it is to either raise taxes (which will only go so far) or cut spending (never gonna happen) or the easiest thing to do is print enough money so that $20 trillion is not that much money (same as a loaf of bread). My thought is that they will choose the latter. What happens to your $100k in google stocks when $100k is worth a tank of gas? There will be a wide range of people on the seastead, some renting, some there for vacation, some owning. At the very least you can use your varyon to go on a vacation to visit the seastead and meet the interesting people that will be living there. The initial seasteads will not focus on moving too much. There have been some designs where each unit is small enough to be loaded onto a tanker and moved (for long distances) or for short distances wait for a calm day and use a tug type of boat to pull it. Interesting. I was a bit bearish and guessed 7500-8000.I guess I win the big prize. When should I expect that in the mail? They changed bitcointalk policy due to NotLambChop's epic trolling.I wonder how long it will take to do the same for this troll.My suggestion:Allow for auto-ignore of all posts quoting ignored posts. You shouldn't call him a retard.I believe the PC term is to say that he is retarded. That way you do not label him as a person, just his actions.He can feel special and it makes everyone happy in the end.  Block size still not big enough. Need another simple hard fork to double the block size.Then moon.Higher block size = bigger price. Seasteading as a solution to rising seas:https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/seasteading-as-a-solution-to-rising-seas-85cc7e809a90 Reaching the hard cap means not taking time to work on funding for those first settlements. The road map is conservative, the whole project is about not overstating.If it is reached Blue Frontiers will own all of the first dozen platforms and can have a more controlled environment which allows for presenting something more cohesive to the world.  Instead they can rent homes and businesses for higher revenue which they can then use to put toward more platforms. They would also have less reserves (which are going toward the initial platforms anyway) which means more varyon in the hands of more people instead of the largest portion held by Blue Frontiers. Italy crisis hurting banks...should we put together a collection?  So...perhaps an Italy bump like when Greece crumbled? I love taking money away from the state. And they think they're being helpful when they do so. lolThanks for the bitcoins suckers. This looks to be the trend in investments. A lot of people putting in 1 ETH to at least be part of it.Definitely not a pump and dump, this project will be around for a long time. At the very least, the US has plenty of free stuff for people without an income.I really need to start taking money from the government. They're just giving it away for free so it's just money there for the taking. There has to be a formula of how many BTC you should buy each time the troll posts. Sell for each day he does not post...
 I guess I'll post one of those wall observer posts to keep the admins happy.Looks like the orders going up at 7k are fairly organic and high. I stopped buying bitcoin as the price was rising so I have enough in the bank to live on beyond 2020. If we repeat the last cycle I won't like it and I may worry a little as the price goes down but when the halving hits again I'm all set. Just walked outside...bloodall over the streetshelp! Good thing I don't trade. Just convert from the old currencies to new. They are still looking at the length of time for locking some of the tokens. It will certainly be part of the smart contract for all to see during the public sale. It will also be a minimum of 1 ETH for the main sale from everything I have seen so far. They have to pay for KYC/AML for each person buying. Definitely. We're all in this for the long haul. If you're looking for a pump & dump this is not it. Agree with both.Though raising chickens for the fun of it is all good. And the satisfaction of knowing what is in your food. And being prepared. And getting drunk with your neighbors when you bring them free eggs... 1 ETH is the minimum for the presale. .1 BTC, 1 ETH or 20 ZEN bisq is p2p akin to localbitcoinsI'm working on one that is sort of like a decentralized tether...turn the fiat to crypto then set it free to be traded like other crypto-crypto. If I were coinbase I would spend a shitload on developing a fiat dex that is running in the background un-seen. Then add more and more "nodes", bringing in partners to run the nodes. Then when the government says, "oh, in addition to all of the other information we're making you collect we now need penis size", they can just say...Coinbase, the company, is shutting down. This affects none of the users. Continue using the DEX. Good luck. Is Jihan still using his proprietary mining hack to get more coins on bcash than other miners? Or are the only people mining bcash using his algorithm?Too bad for him the Segwith fork fixed that. https://medium.com/@bluefrontiers/varyon-in-the-news-facts-and-fictions-9a832e5d775c 99% of decentralized exchanges allow you to trade crypto to crypto.There is one decentralized exchange that uses fiat but that is more like localbitcoins than a real exchange. Agreed. The company is truly international. We have a house in Tahiti but just about everything is done online. Meetings are done via Zoom. Coordination done through Basecamp and other tools. The Founders live all over the world.The hope is that once the legislation passes this summer we will establish a land base on the chosen atoll for preliminary building and housing for future construction workers. The Simpsons is trying to play Bitcoin the same way Dragon Ballz is. So...being involved in an ICO I get to peek behind the scenes to see how these things work.One crazy thing I ran across is this whole telegram phenomenon. Apparently if you don't have at least 2k followers on telegram people automatically think your ICO is shit so they don't join, which means you don't get to 2k telegram followers which means when someone else comes they'll see you don't have a lot of followers so they don't follow...etc. and on and on.So these ICOs have to shell out promises of a portion of their crypto to these bounty programs. Basically all of the shit signature campaigns you see, all of those people join your telegram channel, create very shitty youtube videos so that they can say they created content (I went to one of these videos, the guy went to the web page and video taped him scrolling down the page...with some background music...two different videos created doing that same thing). So...they fill up telegram with a shit ton of bounty program people who probably don't give one shit about your ICO, they're on every telegram channel probably with 10 different accounts. So now you have 2k followers but everyone knows that those are mostly just bounty program people so you should really have 4k or 5k...or whatever.It's all a bunch of crap. We jumped from 200-300 people on the telegram channel mostly organically from sending an e-mail out to people who expressed interest on the website and mainly just people getting the word out on their own. After the bounty program we shot up to 1.4k (plus we had a lot of news coverage this past week so it's not all bounty program). Some dude logged in today with some altcoin profile picture and asked "why so few members?". Because apparently we're not wasting as many coins on shit posters as other ICOs (is what I wanted to say...).This whole telegram thing is pretty stupid, I have no idea why people think it is useful for an ICO. I remember using something like this in MUDs back in 1993, it was the gossip channel, and it was annoying then too. I just keep waiting for someone to chat: "level!"...."grats!" The great thing is, if you believe liberals* who say that natural monopolies form when the free market is left unregulated...that means Bitcoin will eventually become a monopoly and no alt coins will ever again be created.Come on communist economics! Kick in already!*for those outside the US, liberal in the US actually means communist
They did an early seed funding round last year to get things going, pay for environmental and economic impact studies, design work, lawyers, consulting, etc.Most seed funders were friends and family of the founders, as well as the founders putting their own money in. A few bitcoin folks who were known seasteading supporters put in some money, including myself. No big names that most people have heard of. No, Bitcoin Girl Thailand isn't Blue Frontiers' PR girl. She just loves Bitcoin and loves this project so she promotes it a lot. She also joined the bounty program to get a few VAR out of promoting it.Our head of marketing is Laurel Tincher and our seavangalesse is Nathalie Mezza Garcia Screw it. I'm buying moar. I got to about 90% of purchases when I lived in Germany (I think gasoline was the final thing).In the US it would have been so much easier. Bitcoin people in the US have it so easy for spending bitcoins but they don't even know it. Agreed. Decentralized exchanges need to take hold.Bisq is an ok start but p2p is not good for liquidity.I started work on a decentralized exchange that acts just like a regular exchange with fiat. But it's not the simplest of things to accomplish, will take some time. Michael Arrington just tweeted about the project:https://twitter.com/arrington/status/999035151681122305Also:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arrington Ver had to approve the transaction.It met his approval.

The Varyon (VAR) Blue Frontiers holds for seastead and SeaZone Construction, Development, and Administration will be used only as needed, in order to create seasteads and SeaZones and to strengthen the ecosystem of products and services available to Varyon (VAR) holders.4,000 ETH    Soft cap22,000 ETH    Hard cap Ok, that's just what I learned in college about the history of FM but what do I know? I only have a degree in Telecommunications. I could have gone into more detail about Edwin Armstrong and his interesting life story of trying to get FM accepted but it doesn't really relate to Bitcoin and ends with him jumping to his death due to FM not succeeding.As for the seastead. I put an example from my knowledge. If you have other examples of places that only accept crypto and don't accept fiat currencies I would love to hear about them since that is the whole point of the article...getting those companies out there.As for your naysaying about Blue Frontiers (which has only been around for 1 year), I am sure that any seasteading project that came about you would not support due to "you didn't think about water!" (even though we have a team of 70+ very intelligent volunteers that are contributing their expertise in every minute detail that it is less about having information and ideas as it is narrowing things down. So unless you have an expertise in the field you're contributing your ideas about...it would likely already have been covered. We ended up turning away volunteers only allowing about 1 per week due to the large amount of people that want to contribute their ideas.The project will happen with or without your approval. The founders opted for a small ICO with reserves released based upon results in the future as opposed to following the path of all other ICOs where you get a bunch of money for your project then never get around to it due to the amount of time you're spending on vacation or driving your lambo. The founders have been involved in seasteading since 2008, I've been involved since 2008. I retired and moved to Tahiti to help out with the project. The project is legit. You can scream scam all you want. We're too busy making it happen.  Here's a short interview at the TechInAsia conference with one of Blue Frontiers' advisors, Dorjee Sun, talking about sea level rise and seasteading.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WdPu5bNIEE Yes, we love ZenCash at Blue Frontiers. Mainly due to Robert Viglione coming to the seasteading conference last year and being a genuinely nice guy who believes in the tech.I hope that the expertise with that team can contribute to some blockchain advances on the seastead and somehow integrate easily with varyon. Bears...it's been a while. Welcome back.Refer to TERA2 for guidance, he's been here the past year while you were away. 4000 ETH It will all depend on the employees and companies. Blue Frontiers will try to pay as many vendors and employees in varyon. Many of their current employees and companies they work with now have opted to get paid in BTC and ETH.The money raised during the ICO will be split between BTC, ETH, USD and EUR to make payments for all of the work through 2021. They are working on putting a ticker on the website.Last count was 1250 ETH (equivalent). Wow. Interesting how everyone misses the whole point of the article being around the simulcast aspect of early AM/FM and how it relates to companies accepting traditional and crypto currencies.It's about adoption, not about technology.That's why the title says "early FM radio adoption"...not "early FM radio technology". Oh no, I think that blockchain is a radio. I am listening to the blockchain in my car right now.I suspect that nobody has actually read the article though.Perhaps you can tune into your FM blockchain station to find out more. I remember on this forum when we used to welcome newbies to the forum and ask them to let us know if they have any questions. They'd say "thanks, still reading but will take you up on that if I do".Now you see a newbie and think..."shit, signature campaigner trying to get his post count up. Shut up n00b." If you read the article you will see that it says that Bitcoin and radios are the exact same thing. It does not use radio adoption as a mere example, it says that Bitcoin uses radio waves for transmitting music. When you turn on your radio today (if you even use a radio anymore) you will likely tune in to an FM radio station to listen to music. AM radio being reserved mainly for talk shows or other boring things that nobody really listens to. But this wasnt always the case. AM used to be the dominant wave band for most of the 20th century.Although FM radio was created in the 1930s, it had a very slow start in getting widespread adoption. AM radio was what you tuned into if you wanted to listen to a radio station which meant that to listen to FM you would need to buy a radio with FM included and you needed FM stations to listen to. But why would radio companies build FM into their radios if there were no FM radio stations? Why would people create FM radio stations if there were no radios that could listen?This is the same chicken and egg scenario that Bitcoin has faced since its inception. Why would you accept bitcoins at your store if nobody is spending them? Why would you spend bitcoins if no stores are accepting it?Continue...
News about Blue Frontiers Global Contest with Startup Societies Foundation http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/environment/building-sustainable-floating-islands-in-special-economic-zones/article/522016 US investigators would actually have to get on the foreign exchanges to do an investigation.Somewhat related, I downloaded the decentralized exchange, bisq.It's pretty interesting in that you can see the amount of trades daily. US dollar trades are around 15 per day.I went ahead and set up a sell order in baht for my gf to test it out in Thailand. Set it at 10% though so no bites.It's not that great but at least a start. But....I want that now.  Not that I would cash out or anything. I'd still only spend $35k a year to stay in the low income bracket where I don't have to pay taxes.But still...it would make me feel better. Saw that.Looks like the US is going to go after foreign exchanges.Finally the US getting involved with the business of other nations.Oh no, wait. The SEC can only regulate US exchanges. And the US exchanges are basically US government bank exchanges already. So...maybe they will drop bombs on foreign exchanges? That's what the US does best. I'm scared.  We get thousands of people wanting to move to the seastead emailing us.I don't doubt that organizations will want to buy a full platform for their business or organization or even political movements wanting to try out their political ideal on a small scale. Yes. Buying, renting, registering your property, etc.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCu4IuSmvc I was crying all night...got tears in my caviar and champagne. I'll have to have the seats in my Rolls replaced because some of the salt from my crying got on the seats and now they are worthless.jk...went to dinner with friends the other night, they had some big feast with caviar, shrimp, steak, etc. When I saw that their meal was over $100 I opted for the all you can eat chicken wing special for $20. I think they were close to running out of wings by the time I finished. Blue Frontiers is looking at the initial homes to be around $200k per home on average. Unlike land though, the hope is that the cost of manufacturing for these seasteads comes down making property cheaper with more innovation. Looking at the project the pilot project will likely need to still import food. Space will be a premium and building farmland vs oceanfront property for tourists will tend toward the profit made from tourists.Not until the cost of the platforms is down very low will farming be more prevalent. But the company, Blue21, that is doing the design for the Floating Island Project is already working on floating farms.Energy, water, etc. will be created on the platform. I think he is referring to the Le Figaro article in France. For the presale Blue Frontiers accepts ETH, BTC and ZEN.For the public sale it will all be automated through the smart contract via ETH. In a tsunami the safest place to be is floating on the water far away from shore. You probably wouldn't even notice. The hope is for it to be a great hub for blockchain incubation. The whole economy will be crypto based so anyone in this field will find a welcome environment for doing so.As well as just about anything you would do in any city. My idea is to open up an underwater bar that you have to SCUBA dive to. 1k sell wall on finex...great sign that the whale wants us to go up Ya, first time I've ever purchased it. I'll still have to figure out the wallets and such.The hope is that we're near the bottom, I've been waiting to buy ETH cheap against BTC for a few weeks. It was .1 for a while...got in at .0771 ETH = 14750 VAR  I took this opportunity in the drop in ETH to convert some BTC to ETH so I can buy my future seastead home with varyon.Hopefully this dip just got me a few extra square meters. Flash sale at the lambo store. Well, I liked him on that TV show TMZ. I actually watched the Tonya Harding movie on an airplane (There weren't many choices at all). It was actually not bad.As for "white collar criminals"? If there was a victim, then ya...With the dawn of cryptocurrencies and technological ways to protect your money and verify truths, I'm not so sure that fraud is that important of a crime to go after anymore. Rather, more focus should go to making it easier to tell if something is a fraud.
Bearish rectangle?I suck at these things. Can I phone a friend? Price is going to $.01 guyz.Let me save you all buy buying your bitcoins for $.02. Leave you with your dignity. To keep out pictures of grandpa porn.Outside of that...this is only for discussion of the bcash price movement.I will crack down on any post that is off topic immediately.And by crack down I mean read. Last time the wallets were tallied they were at about a third of the soft cap.They have pretty much decided to continue the presale until soft cap is reached. The bulk of it has been the past week as we are working on getting the word out so things are looking good. Great podcast with Robert Viglione of ZenCash about seasteading and Blue Frontiers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWUT2eKMERAYou can check out all of the podcasts including an interview with David Friedman (Milton Friedman's son) here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWUT2eKMERA&list=PLQlyH_Kk03b-5eU68XoHN_xUEzSEC0AMQ Very cool. So...when moon? From the website: We get thousands of e-mails from people wanting to move there. The demand is certainly there. We want to have these all over the world.You can sign up for the $100k contest to try to bring a Blue Frontiers seastead to your country:https://www.blue-frontiers.global/ The goal is for the first platform to be built in 2021. The reality is that most people do not truly want freedom. They just like the slogans.For the rest of us, there's Bitcoin and seasteading. As the tech improves the ability to live on any part of the ocean will grow. The first seastead will likely be in a calm lagoon by a host country. The evolution from there will be to build 12nm out from a nation in a location with waves. Once that has proven itself then a seastead 200nm out will be the goal. At that point you're in the open ocean and it's mostly the same other than going where there are less hurricanes and less rogue waves.It is likely that going into any area with large waves will require floating wave breakers and those will likely use the power of the waves to create energy.The earth is covered 70% by water. There is more space to live there than on land. I doubt any single entity can buy every seastead considering even a small group of people can find an open part of the water to move and not be under their thumb.This is definitely a situation where technology will ruin the plans of centralized powers, much like Bitcoin. Yes, many near the US.Cayman Islands      Bermuda         BahamasTurks & Caicosto name a fewThey also have roads. All I know is that it's been a long time since bcash has been pumped and I'm hoping to get more free money damnit.Come on bcashers. Pump that shit. Regressive would be if the tax rate was higher for lower incomes. A -flat tax- is by definition not a higher rate for lower income. The rate is...flat.Even so, the shitty flat tax proposed every year has a rebate for everyone of the spending they would do up to poverty level. Basically, everyone gets a check every month from the government. I see that as opening the door to some commie bullshit down the line as they just raise the poverty level to a million.Not much can save the US with over $20 trillion of debt. Other than a full on collapse and reboot.There are many countries with no income taxes. Where I live, French Polynesia, for instance.They have roads. Whatever you're most comfortable with. Go with what you know  I checked it out and that's about what we should be looking for to get a consensus of what people support on the seastead. Though I can understand why they did so, their code is not open source. For any major vote I would want to ensure that the system is open and transparent. But for getting a feel for how people feel this is a great app.I wrote one of the first voting systems for Bitcoin many years back and have seen many different products since. The blockchain is a great tool for open/secure voting. No, this is definitely the place for the bitcoin vs bcash debate. The moderator for this thread openly supports such discussion here. If it were to infiltrate the bitcoin part of bitcointalk it would just become annoying as hell. In the altcoin section it makes sense. I just bought a bunch with my credit card. Should be able to lock in some pretty sweet profits before my bill is due.
Please show me where Theymos guarantees profit.Registering with the SEC and guaranteeing profit is an oxymoron.edit: nvm...should have caught the name Howey... We are still vetting several locations in French Polynesia. I will personally be going to sites, likely in July, to do some depth testing, some aerial viewing, etc. to see how viable the locations are.The plan is to find a location that is as calm as possible while still fairly close to shore within a protected lagoon. It would likely only be out a few hundred meters to begin with. They will also be taking into account the coral reef and ensuring that we locate it in a place that has zero impact (unless helpful) to the wildlife in the lagoon. If you just want more information you can sign up on that link at the bottom or subscribe on this link at the bottom: https://www.blue-frontiers.comto get on the mailing list.The company will be doing full KYC/AML for the sale so they will definitely be taking information for that.Being an actual physical company building real world physical things they have to follow more regulations than just utility tokens. We talked to more lawyers than we had ever hoped to talk to about all of this. Being a Singapore company with founders in 4 different countries building in French Polynesia and likely more countries, it was not your typical out of the box company. Blue Frontiers is erring on the side of caution by taking every step necessary to follow the letter of the law on this. Some ICOs have had to return the funds raised and none of the founders want to go to jail for violating the law.Hopefully through seasteading we can introduce a bit more freedom in governance so that things like KYC/AML are something we look back at and laugh about. Right now the main focus is on the ICO so creating content and spreading the word through the Bounty program is probably the best way.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3742962.0;topicseenIf you have some expertise you would like to contribute, please contact Blue Frontiers here:https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/contact There has been an evolving number over the past year due to different designs. Mainly the 25x25m platforms were estimated to cost around $10 million. But I've seen that they are doing different variations with bungalows and condos, so they might be priced differently.Nothing will really be set in stone until all of the engineering and design is done which is the main bulk of what the ICO funds will go toward. But the goal is to average around $200k per person to live there. I have been volunteering for Blue Frontiers since last May. They have over 70 volunteers that have been spending the past year supporting the project since they opened up the volunteer program. We literally turn people away who want to volunteer for the group to not overwhelm the group with too many new people each week who would need to be caught up. At least until we start getting things going.I have been involved in seasteading for the past 10 years and this is the first viable project to come along. I am doing everything I can to make it happen, even moving to French Polynesia to lend my support as needed.For me, the benefit will be a potential future free of the government idiocy that we all have to live with every day. I put in many hours for various libertarian candidates, this is no different. Answering a few questions is no big deal, I did the same thing for Bitcoin in the early days.There is a team of people on various social media sites answering questions. I told them I would handle bitcointalk since I'm on here all the time anyway. In theory they would give me some varyon for my work if I claimed my hours but what's more important for me is the success of this project.If there is more engaging with the community necessary I can certainly ask others on the team to chime in. They hang out mostly on our telegram channel if you want quicker answers to any questions. https://t.me/bluefrontierscommunity New article in the bitcoinistThis Cryptocurrency is funding an autonomous sea dwelling communityWith a great video explaining the project quite well.https://youtu.be/tPIKR8UDDgo From all of the talk I have heard it sounds like they will start the public sale once we reach the soft cap of 4000 ETH (don't quote me on this, it is more reading between the lines than anyone actually saying it). From my e-mail, we have a new announcement of a lowered threshold for the presales:I would suggest getting in quickly, this past week has been big as far as publicity and they're just getting started.CNBCBusiness InsiderBitcoin.comNews BTCThey are also allowing accredited US investors now, so if you are an accredited US investor (net worth of $1 million or income of $200k the past 2 years) you are free to buy VAR. Please see this video on the top 20 ideas for integrating blockchain and seasteading:https://youtu.be/eSbG4LH-QOE?t=319 Agreed, my WO bcash reference meter is showing that a big push upwards is about to occur. Also made MSNBC today:A floating Pacific island is in the works with its own government,...The Floating Island Project is a pilot program in partnership with the government of French Polynesia, which will see 300 homes built on an island that runs under its own governance, using a cryptocurrency called Varyon. Thanks We've had talks with Bravenewcoin which has an identity token in the works, we're looking at some p2p electricity companies out of Australia to see how their pilot projects are going. There are many approaches out there to blockchain voting, we talked to one developer but most of it will not come into play until we get the platforms in the water which will be 2021. In the blockchain space that is like some far off future.One thing we will likely start out with first which I didn't bring up in the video was environmental monitoring on the blockchain. We will set up monitoring devices as soon as possible and try to automate things so that all of that information gets recorded on a public blockchain for anyone to see. That is something we can put in the water before the seastead is even built so we can see the process and do "before and after" types of studies. We have partnered with UC Berkeley for their environmental monitoring program. Find out the top 20 blockchain solutions we're looking at for the seasteads here:http://bitcoingirlthailand.com/2018/05/18/bitcoin-girl-thailand-at-techinasia-2018-in-singapore-discusses-blockchain-and-seasteading/ Bitcoin Girl Thailand interviews me about Blockchain and Seasteadinghttp://bitcoingirlthailand.com/2018/05/18/bitcoin-girl-thailand-at-techinasia-2018-in-singapore-discusses-blockchain-and-seasteading/I give a top 20 list of the blockchain solutions we're looking at for the seastead.Please let me know what you think of the various solutions. Would love to discuss them and go into them more here. There are literally 20,000 bank coins created a day. This one doesn't even rate in the top million. I believe these past two pages are what r0ach has worked his whole life to achieve.2 pages on the Wall Observer thread talking about him.His work paid off. I think converting people to using gold is just the first step. Then he will want the races to be re-named to elves, dwarves, humans and halflings.Then instead of professions we will all have classes.His transformation of everything to the world of D&D will then be complete. If varyon.io does not work, it is just pointing to:https://www.blue-frontiers.com/varyon Being a TA genius I will point out that the lows are getting higher each time.In my expert opinion this is a good thing.PM me if you would like me to explain my very technical analysis, it might take years of study but you might be able to understand eventually.Observe this picture for proof:    /\_          / -_/----\    /     \      /              \ . /         \ .. All great questions and we have a full team that has been focusing on nothing but water/waste for the past year. Since I am in the blockchain group I will not try to cover all of the insanely complicated things those guys discuss in their group because I just peeked into one of their meetings once and sat through three hours of talk about poop and the stages of how it goes from stinky to useful soil.I have heard a few things in the general discussion about rainfall catchment and storage being built into the design and a very heated discussion about not allowing any higher salinity to return to the sea than we take out (minimal impact vs zero impact vs positive impact, etc.). In the lagoon we hope to leave it better than when we arrive.Fortunately the teams are putting together an easy to understand infographic about more of the design elements (the whitepaper is more about the currency and general idea of the company than anything specific about the design). This will also include a full report by each of the design groups that they submitted at the end of 2017 with their recommendations. And as with all of these systems we will initially be very close to land so we will certainly have backups in place as we evolve and grow.
Panic!Blood in the streets time. Umm, I was promised a Consensus bump? If the hard cap is hit they will have funding from the ICO to get through all of the engineering, prototypes and likely construction of the first platform. They will have the reserves from there to pay for further building. This gives Blue Frontiers more control over the experiment of the pilot project which makes it easier overall for Blue Frontiers moving forward after that.If only the soft cap is hit they will be able to fund most of the engineering and prototyping but money will be tight and they may need to burn through some reserves and instead of owning the pilot platforms they will likely have to do pre-sales to other companies/groups/rich individuals. That will make it a bit more difficult but still do-able. But with the soft cap there will be more reserves.Sort of like the difference of having a car company where you build one car at a time and sell it to get money for the next car, or having a manufacturing plant where you can mass produce a bunch.Anywhere in between is just varying degrees between the two. The date will be in June but they don't know when the date will be set yet. You guys...Bitcoin was never meant to upset anyone...especially wealthy bankers.Should we shut it down? Do you think they will forgive us? Can we take up some donations for those affected?  Actually there is no set date yet for the public sale. They are still working on shoring up security for the token, putting as many industry eyes on it (including Dr. Nagy of the Ethereum Institute) to make sure we will have a secure token. Hey gang, I just saw that BitPay is shilling for bcash!When you go to pay with bitcoin they show you two options, bitcoin or bcash. Then they set a minimum network fee for bitcoin and show you the network fee for both. The last time I went to pay for something it showed bitcoin network fee cost of 13 cents and 0 cents for bcash (even though the mempool was empty).Add to that, Coinbase is dropping its payment services.So pretty soon, any merchant accepting bitcoin in the US will be actively encouraging people to use bcash!Bcash to the moon!Thank you BitPay! The company is currently registered in Singapore. So...wtf.Coinbase is stopping all payment services?And BitPay is shilling for bcash, charging high transaction fees for BTC payments even when the mempool is empty and then not providing a bitcoin address to make a payment.No more bitcoin payments for Expedia. My hosting service is making impossible to use bitcoin.Bitcoin use in the US is about to die. Yes, at least for the crypto based funds. Fiat is so much in old times that you can't verify accounts publicly. I'm not...but my gf is  There are discussions on length of time and which of the team will be vested. Public sale is 4-28% depending upon hitting the soft cap or the hard cap. 4,000 ETH Soft cap22,000 ETH Hard capPresale is 7-8% depending upon the hard or soft cap. I've been thinking more about this on the firewall aspect of things. At first I thought it might be just something someone else might want to take and give a try but I was thinking about how this might be fairly simple to implement on a linux box with iptables or something along those lines.What I am running into is the process of whitelisting. If you set your iptables to reject all IP addresses, then have a list of allowed IP addresses based upon 1 satoshi micropayments.My hang up is matching up a micropayment with incoming IP address.With Lightning Network you don't know the source of the funds, just the next hop in the network. So you would have to generate a separate address (or however LN makes unique transactions)  for the IP to pay.Is there a way to have a custom "IP blocked" message such that someone connecting will see something like a Lightning address to send their funds to for access to the server? Assuming this would be a simple plugin to whatever client is accessing the server. Perhaps a popup or dialog saying "webpage.com is requesting 1 satoshi for 1 hour of access, do you accept?" with the acceptance sending the 1 satoshi.I was thinking you could create a table on something like Namecoin and update it (so there is no central server that can be attacked) but that would take time and cost money on the NMC network to update tables.I was also thinking that if you have a single address for your website that never changes, people could send the amount of satoshis equivalent to the last 3 numbers in their IP address...but that would be expensive and high volume servers would likely have repetition. You could send the amount equivalent to the full IP address but then it's super expensive. Could someone send out less than 1 satoshi on LN? What happens with more decimal spaces? Does it get rounded up/down?I'm not saying that this would make a server secure...you would still need to secure it. It would just deter distributed attacks. An attack from a single IP could still happen but in that way your server can detect the attack from a single IP address and block it. I had the Vic20 with cool games such as the tooth brushing game and several math based games.My introduction to programming was:10 print "Chad is cool"20 goto 10Over time I did several print messages to make it look like an ASCII rocket going up the screen. I guess I was preparing for BTC even back then. I believe the plan is to sell OTC or on an exchange as needed once they reach those milestones. It will be gradual, trying to not disrupt the market.The money they make in the ICO will be split between ETH, BTC, EUR and USD to pay out salaries and contracts for construction. Hopefully BTC and EUR values go up so much that they never have to touch the reserves   True, there are floating structures all over the world. What makes a floating hotel different from a seastead is the idea of sovereign governments on the seasteads.We won't be building anything in any nation without the Special Economic Zone to allow for our own experimentation in governance. Otherwise we would just be a floating resort company. There is a floating hotel in Dubai so there is certainly something to point to and show that it can be done from an engineering point of view. But hopefully we are taking things a bit further than anything out there right now.Help with monitoring would be great. That will be one of the first things we require when we have the site picked out. The company name is Blue Frontiers. We wanted a unique name for the token so that people would be able to recognize it and not confuse it with something else. The name Varyon is a play on the word variation...representing the wide variation in governments we're hoping pop up on the many seasteads. I'm not certain that it's 1 ETH, I don't think they've made that decision yet but that's the number I keep hearing. They can only go so low because they have to do KYC/AML for every person and that costs money per person. Blue Frontiers, in collaboration with Startup Societies, has created a global contest. Whoever can facilitate getting their government to create a Special Economic Zone in their nation will win $100k. Read more at http://blue-frontiers.global
Welcome to the Wall Observer thread, I see you've met the resident troll.Please do not quote him as everyone has him on ignore. Because we're all jews. There is now a bounty program  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3742962.0 This has been my role as a volunteer for Blue Frontiers to push for as much blockchain based solutions for anything and everything happening on the seastead.I see the seastead as an incubator for all sorts of new blockchain companies. If you're coming to the seastead, be ready to experience the latest technology in the crypto space. Even if at times it is a bit confusing and in the early stages of "ease of use"  Varyon can become the hub that all of these companies need to go through to get their solutions paid for since everyone will already be using it. Even though in the private businesses they can accept any currency. The reserve is there for spending at certain milestones. If the ICO raises the maximum amount that should be enough for all of the engineering and prototyping to get at least the first seastead in the water. The reserves will be sold down the road to build more seasteads.The thinking behind this is that so many of these ICOs raise their full amount of money in the first round then you see the founders out driving lambos and going on kick ass vacations and never actually getting around to doing what they promised (why would they? they have the money). With holding a reserve, Blue Frontiers has the incentive to do well so that they can sell the tokens down the road to continue the project.Everyone in the project wants this to happen, it's not about the money but the vision. #Proof Of AuthentificationBitcointalk Username: ElwarFacebook Campaign: https://www.facebook.com/supranee.thepdet.7Twitter Campaign: https://twitter.com/ThailandBitcoinTelegram: @Bitcoingirlthailandreddit:https://www.reddit.com/user/ElwarReserve Thai translation. Blue Frontiers actually gets the whole "pirate" question a lot. So much that they added it to the bitcointalk ICO thread: I like how ZenCash just said..."ok, we're going to take your crypto that you created and pre-mined...and we're going to create the exact same coin but without the pre-mined coins".This should be done far more often with pre-mined coins. There are no past seasteads, this will be the first so they could not reference any past projects.TSI commissioned the study from an independent company, that was part of the deal with French Polynesia...to get an economic and environmental impact study before they would grant the legislation. TSI and Blue Frontiers delivered both. Now that the FP election is over we're hoping for some legislation soon.We will most definitely be doing physical environmental impact studies throughout the term of the project. I know it is not marine science but I will be personally going to the location before anything is put in the water and take "before" pictures of as much of the area as I can to ensure that the coral is not damaged in the lagoon. Other studies will be the various PH, chemical, salt levels, etc.They will ensure to have a "control" area where there are no seasteads to compare to.Being part of the blockchain group I am not involved in that group but we did discuss the desire to have all data stored on a blockchain, hopefully some monitoring devices that can feed the blockchain over time. We want to be as transparent as possible and believe a blockchain based setup would help ensure that there's no suspicion of manipulated data on company servers.Being a pilot project we know many eyes will be on us and detrimental impact with the environment would stifle any future projects so there has been a huge focus on this. We are not hoping to just not harm the lagoon but help it to thrive and benefit from our presence. That not only benefits the environment but our project as well.We want nations banging on our door to build seasteads in their protected waters...that won't happen if we're dumping toxic waste turning our pilot lagoon into a radioactive cesspool. The ICO thread is here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3708700.0Go check it out.Feel free to discuss seasteading in this thread.What types of governments do you think the different seasteads will produce? Do you think some will win out and some lose if people can vote with their homes. Interesting take on the conceptual design. Any number of theories could be created for something that does not yet exist. Even pirates  That's why I'm supporting the project that will approach seasteading incrementally instead of starting out in middle of the ocean.Blue Frontiers currently has a pilot project which will be built in a Special Economic Zone in a protected lagoon close to the coast of a French Polynesian island. This will allow them to work out most of the kinks of seasteading under the full military protection of French Polynesia (a place with no pirates, low crime, no hurricanes and will not likely be going to war any time soon). They will also have the full criminal justice system of French Polynesia so thinks like building prisons or courthouses and worrying about what to do in case of theft or at the worst, murder, has already been figured out by the host nation.They are currently putting together an ICO that is in pre-sale right now: https://www.varyon.ioThe public sale will be in early June.You can join the discussion here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3708700.msg36961869Or ask any questions you have here. I've been volunteering for them for a year now so I'm up to speed on most things going on with the project. I even retired and moved to Tahiti to have a front seat at making history with the first seastead. The five founders are all over the world. The US, UK, Russia and French Polynesia. Most of the employees are in the US and there are volunteers and advisors all over the world as well.I don't work for Blue Frontiers but I support the project so much that I retired and moved to Tahiti to offer any support I could give and to have a front seat of history being made.  Current minimum for the pre-sale is the equivalent of 40 ETH in ethers or BTC. Or 100 ZEN. During the public sale the minimum will likely be 1 ETH.Blue Frontiers is currently incorporated in Singapore but that could change. Much of the work is being done in the US, mainly the Silicon Valley area.Last numbers I saw were about $200k per person on average to have a home on the seastead. Of course that's the average so some places may be single person bungalows that cost a lot or apartment units that cost less. The hope is to develop mass production techniques that can put out cheaper and cheaper units giving the average person the opportunity to have an oceanfront home much cheaper than on the land.The Pre ICO started about a week or two ago. The full ICO will likely be in early June as they work on running security checks on the smart contract with many eyes including a third party team who is well known for securing ICOs (I'm not sure of the name right now). There will be a bounty program. Coming soon (TM).We are working on putting the first pilot project in French Polynesia in a protected lagoon in paradise. So...where are we on the chart with the Swamp of Despair and such?I want to see that we're past the worst at least  two more walls indicate we have further to go downOne at $8878 and another at $8770...smaller one at $8630.manipulators gonna manipulate I have no official role in Blue Frontiers. I just support the project and have invested in the company in the hopes of getting this things going. I retired and moved to Tahiti to monitor activity and see if there is any role I can play as it comes up (currently looking at setting up a bitcoin exchange in Tahiti as I believe that they'll need a local exchange if we will be using a lot of crypto on the seastead). I currently live in a house with others working on the project including one of the founders. So I can see first hand that these guys are working their asses off day and night.The money I make if the ICO is successful isn't much more than what I make if the bitcoin price goes up a bit so I'm not pushing the ICO to make money, actually had I kept my investment in BTC I would have made more money. I'm just putting my money toward something I believe in. I stuck my gf's affiliate link for Varyon in my signature so she can make a little bit of money if someone buys through that link.Plus I believe in the project so I want it to succeed. I've been following seasteading for 10 years and this is the closest we've been to actually getting something going.I have railed against signature campaigns though. It has filled the rest of the forum with garbage posts just for the sake of posting.My garbage posts are for my own amusement. I finally retired my BitPools logo. Even though the website hasn't been up for a few years I kept the logo up because I paid someone 1 BTC for it back in 2013. I'm going to laugh my ass off when decentralized exchanges make all of these centralized exchanges extinct..."but muh regulation compliance...!" Yes, the pre-sale minimum is set fairly high. The public sale will be 1 ETH minimum I believe. I believe they're hoping the bulk of the sales come during the public sale, the pre-sale is a manual process while the smart contract is vetted for security.Yes, they released the EIS documents to the French Polynesian government and then made it available on their website. https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/docs  Before, during or after?
Hope so. The huge buy wall at $9300 on finex tells me the price is going down. Regularly when I log into my linux server as root I'll see how many login attempts occurred since my last login. In a day it is usually around 50-100k attempts. Of course they'll never get in because I don't allow root access from outside. But what if there were a way to start implementing LN microtransactions at the firewall level, or at least any login attempt? Sending some fairly insignificant amount of bitcoins every time you log in with a simple browser or client interface that you might not even need to click when you try to get to the site. Set it up the first time you visit and you're all set. Anyone requesting access has to pay (something like 1 bit) regardless of where they're logging in from. Something where over the lifetime of your access you may end up paying 10 cents.But for hackers or DDoSers, they have to pay thousands and thousands of bits to just attempt to hack the site. Over time that would add up for the hacker and make it costly to be a hacker. It is interesting going back to old wallets and scrubbing them for "dust" these days.I went to my old BitPools website files and knew I had used a few test accounts to make sure the whole process worked with some small amounts of bitcoin.Turns out those small amounts were .5 BTC each. Around 7-8 tests. I had to write some scripts to scrub a few 10,000 keys files but it paid off...literally.Now I get to gather all of my fork coin bonus points.I'll probably throw most of the found money into varyon. I see it as more money to go toward my future seastead home.  Tell her to buy and hodl! I'm hoping that if we can do it "because we can" once, then implement mass production or an open 3D printing method, that we can bring the costs down to the point that it will be cheaper to live on the sea than on land. In most cases, the first seastead will be cheaper than oceanfront property on land.An even bigger hope would be that we move to the 70% of the world covered in water and some future generation talks about how a long time ago humans used to live in those eco-tourism places where the plants and animals live in abundance...in other words...land. The kids would laugh and say "how would you float your home to your next city on land? What about the earthquakes/volcanoes/tornadoes/flooding?" as they laugh and laugh about the silly primitive people. Same project a year later, much has occurred since then.I understand your worries about water and waste. I have every confidence in the very intelligent team that has been working on that for the past year. There are over 70 volunteers and at least a dozen staff that have been tackling every little bit of this from food to water/waste to energy to communications, blockchain, governance, etc.I know you think this must be some scam because "you haven't thought about...<fill in your preconceived notion>" but no...it likely has been thought of. I've been in the meetings with some of the most intelligent people in their fields discussing things I've never even considered even after being involved with seasteading for 10 years. I've sat through a several hours long presentation on poo and toilets that I would have rather not watched (some people are very passionate about such things).I have followed the seasteading space since watching Patri Friedman give a speech in 2008 about it. I have seen many projects come and go. I have not gotten involved with any of them because I could see they were only dreaming and had their heads in the clouds.This project is the first one that is actually taking an incremental approach, not trying to create something in the high seas 200 miles from anywhere. Or just buying a boat and calling it a seastead.If you don't believe that a simple platform can float in a calm lagoon and produce electricity and deal with water and waste...then no seasteading project will ever be viable in your eyes. This project even has a step before the platform where we will be on land doing much the same thing in the years leading up to production. The only difference when that finally happens is that the land under the houses will now be floating on water. Every step incremental. No huge leaps. Using technology that exists instead of pie in the sky ideas.I have every confidence in this project and have even retired and moved to Tahiti to help ensure that the project moves forward as advertised, being perfectly willing to call out anything that looks to be a scam. The reason it has taken a year is that they wanted to get it right. I've been frustrated at times wishing they would just throw together a quick ICO and take advantage of the hype last year but they have been meticulous with their lawyers and following every SEC move on this thing. And they wanted to move forward with something they felt was legit. They're an international team working on an international project that will be physically built all over the world with investors from all over the world. This has been no simple task. Even their comparatively low hard limit for the ICO was conservative in my opinion.  The Seasteading Institute is responsible for promoting the idea of seasteading and trying to push forward activity in this sphere.French Polynesia reached out to the Seasteading Institute to come up with a way to use one of their protected lagoons for a pilot project in the hopes of bringing seasteading technologies to their islands that are under threat of sea level rise.The Seasteading Institute is a non-profit with a set objective of spreading awareness, so the Executive Director and one other top director of TSI along with 3 others related to this deal formed their own for-profit company called Blue Frontiers. Blue Frontiers will be put in charge of the Special Economic Zone being developed in French Polynesia. They have already submitted an environmental impact study and an economic impact report to the government of French Polynesia. Now that the elections are over, FP will likely begin getting to work on that legislation.Meanwhile, Blue Frontiers is raising funds via an ICO at https://www.varyon.io to get the initial funds for engineering research to build prototypes and set up a construction site on a piece of land next to the lagoon at one of several locations under negotiation. They are asking for a comparatively small raise of between around $5 million and $15 million. The higher raise would get them to their initial platform in the water while the lower raise would require some pre-sales and other forms of raising funds for the pilot project. https://www.varyon.io The initial pilot project will likely be more like the legality of a business or combination of businesses (I guess like a market or shopping area? no idea for sure but we don't want the pilot project to fail due to a meth lab being made on the first seastead).The pilot project is just that...a pilot. A way of testing new things in a semi controlled manner. Whether or not implementing a more libertarian system gradually or not is not the question.Saying that government is the people is a tool used to put blame upon the people that elected these fools as if to imply all people in that country support that government. Or to imply that the people merely have to raise their voices and the government will comply. A significant portion of the people didn't like what their government was doing back in the late 1800s and decided to opt out, only to have several hundred thousand men killed as a result.Only a few hundred people in the US actually elect our president. They are more to blame than "the people" for his actions. A minority of people actually voted for those electors. They are more to blame than the people.When the government acts by a different morality than the people, then the government cannot possibly be the people. No person can steal from someone else under the guise of being helpful. No person can murder innocent people under the guise of "protecting freedom". No person can kidnap people and put them in a cage under the guise of "justice". The people cannot do these things, only the government can get away with it. Thus, governments are not the people. I guess...if the American government is the people...then I hate myself.I am the cause of all of the bad decisions made in Washington DC.btw...someone broke BTC...crashing hard. Born in America. So I'm native American. Hitler's government was the people.That's why I hate all Germans. Why did the German people send so many people away to extermination camps? Why German people? Why?!?Same for Americans. Why are the American people always deciding we need war in the Middle East? Why American people?Why do the American people keep pushing the Federal Reserve Note down our throats? Is there an ICO for this baby brain technology I've missed? To the moon! I've had the same credit card for the past 20 years or so...the points I've accumulated might get be a domestic flight...though the restrictions on those flights keeps going up as well as the amount of points that a flight costs.While having bitcoin in my wallet and not worrying about keeping fiat to spend on such things means I can retire. No, cheapair has been fine for me. The flight I was taking was from Bangkok to Tahiti which is not that common of a flight so cheapair did not have many options. I had to go with an Australian company that flies to Tahiti and Bangkok very often. They only took credit cards...which is a huge hassle. Looking back 5 years I'm glad I made the decision to make bitcoin my primary currency and only sell for fiat when I needed to.So every time I paid for anything with bitcoins meant that I didn't have to hold fiat on the off chance that I was going to need to spend it. I have used cheapair.com for all of my flight purchases for years. I live internationally, buy international tickets all the time. No problems with cheapair paying with bitcoins.I just bought a ticket for my girlfriend here in Thailand on kiwi.com because the only flights available on cheapair were $4k+ while the one I found on kiwi were $1500.I actually bought the ticket a few weeks ago but when I went to print it out for her visa I saw that they never booked the flight sending her e-mails about verifying my payment.I booked it again. I had to send them a copy of my passport, then a selfie. Then they e-mailed me with a phone number to call. I called the number and they verified more information, and now I have to wait for a third party service to get back to me to see if I'm ever so lucky to have the transaction go through.I hate when I go from bitcoin back into the stone age of legacy finance. Everyone needs to just catch up already. I have seen this in a news article but have not seen any laws about this.It is illegal everywhere in the world?
Governments are the ones that go to war. Ban their weapons. Actually, calling it bcash on the BCH/USD Wall Observer thread is not only accepted, but encouraged.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3386487.msg35480059#msg35480059 Interestingly enough the architecture firm doing the design of the Blue Frontiers seasteads is a Dutch firm who built a floating pavilion in Rotterdam. Blue21They have some great expertise on these types of things and will be a valuable asset going forward. I actually started to pull out my private keys to start dumping BCH but realized I'm traveling and I don't have the full set of keys available. Oh well, will wait for the next pump. News has not really played that big of a role in the bitcoin price in the short time that I've ever seen.Usually it's like google trends where people look for the news to justify whichever way the price has gone. Someone asked me if he should sell when the price was around $9100. I was going to tell him to sell around $9950, not $10k because everyone will set that as their sell number...if he was going to sell.Instead I told him to come up with a number that made sense from his budget and what he needed and stick to that. Telling him to rely on the numbers to determine when he needed to sell as opposed to selling on emotion. That was more on the par of advice for the long term as opposed to the immediate market. The huge buy walls I see on the buy side on 'finex tells me it is whales screwing with things. This woman lives on something floating: https://www.cbsnews.com/video/88-year-old-retires-and-lives-on-cruise-ship/People live on floating things all the time. Stupid people: "when the price gets to $10k I can buy...X...so I'll sell at $10k" Looks like 10k will have to wait until tomorrow. But...long fast dialogues about the state of humanity right now...and Star Wars references... 10000.gif^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H Do not buy bitcoins. Keep your fiat money.Bitcoin is still as much of a joke as it was when it was $6k.Move along. But...vegeta...   Did the government want the end result to be a rover on Mars?Does the government want the end result of climate change studies to show the public that they need more government? This.I once did a division level battle scenario simulating all of the network traffic and wireless traffic with moving troops and terrain. We had drones flying in the air acting as range extenders for people on the ground to get over hills and other things blocking line of sight.It took us a very very long time to get the simulation running...the thing kept crashing due to the amount of information we were throwing through it. We had to extrapolate as much as we could to get it to run. I stayed up all night one time to get it to run all the way through for the first time. The results showed that the drones were bottle necked with traffic and hardly anything was getting through. Knowing this wouldn't sit well with the green suits we extrapolated some of the models differently so that we could get better results. Who knows what the reality was. I was just glad we were on the research end of things. When I started working in real world environments it wasn't as fun. One time I was working on a system being used in Iraq but it was down for a few days while we worked on some broken code. During that time 10 marines died and one of my frustrated co-workers blamed me for their deaths due to our system being down (the reality was that even with a perfectly working system they would have still died). Research is much better. Throwing wild numbers out that don't matter for a long time is easy.  Interesting that we have been in that middle channel for so long. Even if we followed the lower channel we'd be in decent shape long term. I think humans can strive to be better than cyanobacteria. Our global apocalypse will be better. What kind of cars caused the first five extinction events? If they had Teslas would they have been prevented? Looking to hit a conference somewhere in Asia while I am here. Preferably around May 20th.
History deniers still believe that socialism can solve things. As someone who worked as a defense contractor for over 20 years I will say that there is little science being done when working for the government.It's mostly "what answer does the customer want?" followed by tweaking the numbers in the models to meet their expectations so that when the time comes they will continue to give you contracts.   (eg. this Colonel is in the pocket of Harris Corp so when we do the side by side comparison of a Lockheed and Harris radio we need to make sure the Harris radio comes out as the superior radio). If we don't give them the numbers they expect then they claim that we have faulty models and don't know how to do simulations so they will find someone with more "realistic" numbers. So you play their game.The amount of tweaking that could be done for wireless radio simulations was endless. I can only imagine what the global temperature models are like. When it doesn't directly benefit the government who funds the "scientific" research I will be more open to looking further into it.Until then it's like believing Hitler's scientists when they say that the aryan race is superior. If the scientists at the time were like "it appears that the aryan race is superior but there is no reason to try to eliminate other races and try to prop up the aryan race, if they are so superior that will happen over time naturally with absolutely no intervention by the government" then I might be like...hmm, that science seems like it might be legit. Maybe I'll look into it further and check the numbers.There is no coincidence that the fall of communism coincided with the rise in global warming fears...rats fleeing the sinking ship found a new vessel. In before: One hard choice would be for the government to pay off their $21 trillion debt. The future consequences of that will be devastating. Only math deniers don't believe this. Varyon will be the base currency when dealing with anything related to Blue Frontiers, including property, etc.Depending upon the amount raised during the ICO the full project could be funded just through the ICO or at the lower end the initial platforms can be built and sold in order to fund the rest of the builds. The hope is that there is enough raised through tokens that Blue Frontiers will be able to build all of the pilot platforms and rent them out or sell them in a controlled manner. Money from timeshares would bring in a lot of money for the company to move forward building new platforms and improving production to bring costs down. If the ICO is on the low end they will be able to build a few initial platforms and with the sale of one platform they can build more, following more of a manufacturing model where they get paid for manufacturing and selling platforms.It is not yet known what the fees will be for property owners, the idea behind seasteading is having a variation in governance models so one platform might set up a property tax or marina/condo or timeshare type fees while another might have some other structure for maintenance. The hope is that maintenance is kept to a minimum for these platforms. If the solution to global warming was "oh shit, looks like we'll need to shut down governments and implement anarcho-capitalism to save the planet"...then I might be more inclined to believe the scientists that are paid by the government.When the solution to global warming (science funded by governments) is "we need to give more power to governments" makes a fella go...hmmm.... Much of science has so many similarities with religion that it is not all too different. If someone believed in science as something where people should continue to ask questions and hypothesize on just about anything, then questioning the consensus certainly falls within the nature of science. Had we all agreed, due to consensus, that smoking is good for you then we would all be a lot worse off right now.Challenge the accepted norms, question everything even if "the majority" believes it to be different. This is science.But you probably don't believe in such science. Only the religion. Early on that might be the case, but I think the team plans on composting so even if the waste needs to be exported it will be exported as soil (initially). With innovative food systems on the anchor zone on land all of the waste can be utilized within the community. Here is the current timeline Blue Frontiers has laid out to get things going. 2017: Signed MOU with French Polynesia; launched Blue Frontiers; held researchersFloating Island Research: Science & Technology meeting at theUC Berkeley Gump Station on the Island of Moorea. Co-hosted first internationalseasteading gathering in Tahiti. Conducted significant economic,legal, and environmental research; developed new seastead designs; builta global team 2018 Q1: launched Blue Frontiers Global & Blue Frontiers Communities  2018 Q2: launch Varyon  2018 Q3-Q4: acquire a SeaZone from a host nation; continue negotiationsfor additional SeaZones; engineer and blueprint seastead designs 2019 Q1/Q2: prototype seasteads; wave-model testing; manufacturer andsupply chain assessments 2019 Q3/Q4: manufacturer and construction team selection. Construction/manufacturingbegins  2021: first seastead is deployed Your former engineering questions answer the latter question about why a host country is needed.Previous seasteading projects focused on having a seastead out in international waters (200nm away from any country) with estimates being in the hundreds of millions of dollars (just look at the cost of an oil rig to get an idea of cost). The hope is that we can come up with some better engineering that will get that price down over time. There are so many different things to consider when trying to create a seastead in international waters that not experimenting would be a rather foolish way to risk so much money.This has resulted in considering a phased approach.Phase 1 is building a pilot seastead in a protected lagoon of a host country.Phase 2 is moving/building 12nm out from that location giving more sovereignty while having the challenge of open water, while maintaining a lifeline to the host nation.Phase 3 is full sovereignty 200nm out in international waters. Having a host country lets Blue Frontiers build in a protected lagoon which allows for working out such concepts as you mentioned, governance, citizenship, sustainability, engineering, etc. All things that might sound good on paper but once on an actual seastead might have complications that nobody ever considered. It also allows some hybridization so that baby steps can be taken. Food, for example, will be difficult to grow initially and is likely more cost effective to just buy it from the host nation. Internet can more easily be transmitted to the seastead. Many initial requirements can be covered in an incremental approach which allows Blue Frontiers to raise a smaller amount of money up front and grow from there.A host country also gives the protection of the military which would be an even larger economic cost to a fledgling new seastead in international waters.With the Special Economic Zone Blue Frontiers will be given some economic leeway which will allow for some initial experiments in governance but will still be under French Polynesia criminal law so rape, theft, murder, etc will have a fully functional justice system to take care of such things without needing to start from scratch.  And...we broke upwards. Get ready for my devaluation fork coming soon(tm).This won't be your typical fork, converting your coins will be easier.I will give you an address to send your bitcoins and I will send you .01 fork coins back which will now be called 1 bitcoin. I used mBTC for the longest time even when the price was around $100 because I always assumed that one day the price would go to $1000 and one mBTC would equal $1. In the US and Europe we have one way of thinking when it comes to dollars and euros which we think is the natural way of thinking of prices.Other places I have lived the currency is such a tiny denomination that having a million of the currency isn't that big of a deal.In French Polynesia it's about 100 francs to the dollar. I guess it's natural for the locals but I always look at the price and think of it in terms of pennies (moving the decimal two places to the left to see the dollar denomination).The key though is that no country's currency is as valuable as bitcoin so it's unnatural for everyone to think in terms of .00001 etc.Satoshis would satisfy many countries and slowly evolve so it's more natural for US and Europe. The dollar and euro will be like the rest of the world's currencies eventually anyway. I just hope it's not a libertarian.Being the last captain on the titanic makes it look like it was his fault as you're sinking. Even if you just grabbed the wheel at the last second while the person who steered you toward the iceberg is down in the cantina getting drunk.With $30-$50 in debt with almost all taxes going toward interest payments on the debt we will not last much longer at that point. Whoever is in charge will be blamed when that happens. There are more than 993 days in 6+ years. Seems like a significantly smaller amount of 10k addresses now than when I last checked.I wonder what the breakdown is of how many of the big addresses have grown, on average, smaller over time. Maybe one day bcash will be back to .2 BTC...and maybe this thread will reach .2 Wall Observer BTC/USD...need someone to pump the posts classicThough I usually don't respond to trolls, this one is easy.Blue Frontiers is in the process of establishing a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in a protected lagoon in French Polynesia. A Seazone that will have autonomy economically but still have the military protection of the host nation. French Polynesia being the only nation we can publicly mention that we have an agreement with right now.hmm, so a floating platform in the water that does not need an engine to move or need to traverse the open ocean would require an astronomical effort while a boat that someone can live on is ok if you're broke...Now, this pilot project phase is of course just the first phase. Phase 2 is 12nm out with more sovereignty and Phase 3 is the full 200nm international waters sovereignty. Each phase is required to enhance the engineering required to accomplish the task of having a floating city survive and thrive in their location. Though speculation about what the city will look like in international waters is a bit silly on a web forum before the pilot in a lagoon is even created, I would imagine some sort of energy generating breakwaters enclosing the whole city. But those are the discussions we will be having on the seastead where we learn from living, not on Internet forums.
Hmm, real estate that is mobile...That's part of why I'm interested in seasteading. I'm investing the amount in the Blue Frontiers currency what I would pay for a house (the only currency they will accept for seastead real estate). SEC won't let me say the value of that investment will go up but at least I won't have to worry about buying the limited currency down the road. Happy May Day.Today I lit a candle in front of my Karl Marx statue and repeated the planks of the Communist Manifesto...again.So many socialist holidays...so few candles... When you have to pay property taxes can you ever really say "You own it outright"? Anyone else going to the bcash conference in Hong Kong this month?https://coingeek.com/conference/agenda/They will have such innovative speakers as Jihan Wu in the morning, Roger Ver and Craig Wright in the afternoon then Jihan Wu, Craig Wright and Roger Ver on a panel discussion later in the afternoon.Then you can meet notable people at the after party such as Roger Ver, Craig Wright and Jihan Wu.Don't miss this exciting conference with so many bcash experts! I would invest in gold if I weren't so mobile globally.As for real estate...ya, that might be the last thing they take or it will be the first thing they take if it's convenient for them.If I don't have enough fellow patriots to come help me with a standoff I'm screwed for that investment. I try to not invest in anything that requires government intervention. This includes stocks, real estate, anything bank related...well, actually it only leaves crypto.I would love to own real estate but I have to trust that the government that sanctions such property will not need to extract value from that property when their bills start to add up. Same with anything of value that the government could possibly manipulate. That's why I pulled out everything from my Roth IRA. The idea being that I can invest now and the government won't take taxes on it when I retire...ya, I'll believe that one when the US federal government is $21 trillion in debt. 2 factor is certainly a good idea Yes, the seller would have to have an app to tell the website that a card was sold. Otherwise the website will not release the coins. So someone could steal all of the cards and they would get nothing. This is how the phone cards work in some countries.I suppose there can be some sort of re-issuance of cards to the seller if they are stolen (at the seller's expense). The numbers on the original cards will be frozen and new numbers created.I suppose the seller could be an asshole and just sell the cards without informing the website. But this does not benefit the seller in any way and only pisses off the buyer. And complaints about that seller could have him banned or somesuch. It just wouldn't make business sense. So I'm sitting here in Thailand at a bar and about every 30 minutes someone with a small set of merchandise walks by my table and offers to sell me something (fake watches, makeup, cialis, etc.).It got me thinking of how that could be done with bitcoin.My thought is to have a website where you print out bitcoin cards similar to how some countries do prepaid minutes on phone cards. The card would be valued at $10, $20, $100, etc. There is a scratch off portion with a number underneath. When the person sells the card they scan a code on the card to show that it has been sold. The buyer then scratches off the number and goes to the website provided. The website can then see that the number was sold and when the person claims the number it converts the amount purchased into bitcoins stored on the person's wallet on the website. Then the person can just withdraw the bitcoins to whatever wallet they want.The exchange rate would be marked up about 10% to make profit. The rate could be set this way because this would be more for novelty and convenience than any real investing. Just so someone can say "I have $10 worth of bitcoins!". The person going out and doing the selling can get 5-8%, the website gets the other portion, or even 0% if they just make their money on advertising or withdrawal fees or just price gain of bitcoin over time.I figured instead of going through the process of becoming a bitcoin exchange and registering and all of that, the website can just require that the purchaser pay in bitcoins for the amount of money on the cards. The website never sees fiat, they are only releasing a fiat denominated amount of bitcoins to people. That way they never have to have a bank account and can duplicate this for all currencies all over the world. The seller will need to convert from their local currency to bitcoins, but they will be able to do it at a lower rate either through an exchange or localbitcoins. The website can even assist people with that process by providing them a localbitcoins partner who will take bank transfers and send the bitcoins to the website.The risk is that the bitcoin price drops over a long enough period that the website cannot cover the fiat value over time. But there is little risk that in the long term bitcoin value will go down as compared to the value of fiat.It might even be possible to do this with a Rootstock smart contract so there is no central company to be targeted by regulators that are under the thumb of banks. The only thing bcash cured was stopping an endless supply of Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, etc. If n00bs going to bitcoin.com are buying an alt coin that is being presented as bitcoin and then they try to go spend their "bitcoins" they will find that they actually have some other coin that doesn't do what bitcoins actually do. This is where they are being scammed. Buy the diphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0akBdQa55b4 Their idea of "a manner that would avoid affecting the market price" was likely selling OTC to large buyers. But those large buyers would have gone through the market anyway so they didn't avoid shit. They were just pleased with themselves that they didn't go on Bitstamp and place a huge sell order driving the price down on that exchange all at once. Instead, they prevented money coming in to even out the money going out.You can also see the obvious whale buys over the past week that pushed the price up over and over again. I am thinking that was probably someone involved in Gox with knowledge of it all pumping the price for good returns. Or maybe they retire, spend time on projects they actually care about, put their money toward things that interest them and watch it all grow while keeping an eye on this thread to see why their money is doing what it is doing. I have about 60 years of computer graphical design experience.That's why I can draw graphs like this:___/ If we all work hard enough, bcash can become PayPal 2.0!https://coinjournal.net/roger-ver-paypal-acceptable-risk-bitcoin/ These prices are soooo last week.. You need to sell your bcash for copper and nickel! That is the only true money.The world is run by Pentecostal Holiness, only holding copper and nickel can stop them! I considered talking about nothing but the copper and nickel metal market. As someone with a lot of bcash I created a Wall Observer thread here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3386487.0Let's pump this baby to .2 BTC again folks!

That's no lambo Just like when Porsche came out with their SUV.   So does the bcash arguing mean that we're over the whole "bitcoin is going down!" talk and now we're fighting over which coin is going to be the new world currency?I just hope bcash gets back up to .2 BTC again so I can dump the rest. Seems legit. Who am I to argue with some? You all don't realize how powerful the Dragon Ball franchise is. They have been milking the "It's is over 9000!" thing for all it's worth. They had to rush to crash the market when it jumped to almost $20k pushing the price back down so they could repeatedly have the price go over 9000.Some theorize that this is the sole purpose of the creation of Bitcoin. For Earth Day I lit a candle in front of my Karl Marx statue and repeated the planks of the communist manifesto.Community, Equality, Tyranny my fellow citizens. I have had people trust 0 confirmation transactions from me. But for exterior reasons not related to the currency.Such as buying a coffee and drinking it there at the small cafe where I chatted a bit with the owner already. Or a hamburger place.Though I have had people trust larger transactions from me...but those were for localbitcoins after we had established a relationship and trust. With the full knowledge that if I screwed them over they could give me bad feedback and make further selling of bitcoins by me very difficult.  10% beats the 20% currency exchange rate in French Polynesia.I want to buy a car but I refuse to lose 20% of value plus wire fees to do it. I rely on small trades here and there for spending money but I'm still trying to work out a way to get about $2-6k into CFP.I will likely just buy a scooter when I get back. I considered trading baht to CFP here in Thailand but no exchange deals with such an obscure currency. 0 confirmation transactions already exist...it's been a thing since Bitcoin existed, I pay the thing is, do you trust the transaction if it's not confirmedMaybe they will push for some whitelist of trusted people or something stupid like that. I was sitting at the pool here in Pattaya and some thai girl was taking off her t-shirt that said HoldOn forDear Lifeon the back. Then she hung out with her foreign boyfriend in the pool. I figured he was the rich bitcoin guy that got his hot young thai girl (with fake titties and all).As I was leaving I commented "Awesome t-shirt man". They looked at me like I was crazy. Are we back to weekend pumps? That's what I'm talking about. Seasteading: where we're going we don't need roads Anyone can waste their money to be a dick in the short term. Plenty of cases of people throwing their money away on stupid things. The free market makes it so that those stupid ideas die without a constant stream of money. I didn't go to no Harvard or anything so I don't know about all of them fancy words.But all I know is the bitcoin price is up 1% for the day.As for "we need to think of shorting"...I can only speak for myself and I will be hodling. Interesting thing about the IMF's recent support of blockchain is that the head of the IMF is advised by a french libertarian, Gaspard Koenig. Gaspard just recently joined Blue Frontiers as an adviser and has been a big supporter of seasteading since he first heard about it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion Ya, I have 2 dogs. I was able to get them to Germany but fortunately I have a nice mother who would rather I be able to travel than worry about moving my dogs so she watches them. I would love to bring them with me but they would definitely get the way of my mobility. Well..Koh Lan to be more specific.  Well, it would depend upon the vote. And the governance model created by the platform.My thought is that there will likely be one person one vote types of models as well as PoS votes.My BitPools idea was that people would vote on a project with their money, while receiving an equal benefit to their contribution.For a one person one vote approach we will definitely be doing an identity token or an address identified by a single person. This will be used for other things in the community like visas and passports.The first vote I suggested was an opinion type approach where we try to decide what location in French Polynesia to do the pilot project. I think a PoS approach would show where the money wants it to happen. And that would be an easier voting system. A one person one vote method would require people showing up to register, which would be more for when people are actually living on the seastead.
I think eventually it will be affordable. You at least need low income workers for many things so you would be required to have low costing housing. I have been there many times. My gf lives there. I'm going to help work out her visa to come to Tahiti.Will be in Pattaya this week though for a bit of beach life (same thing as here but I guess different colored sand). I see seasteads more as blank slates than no governance whatsoever.Sure, right off of the production line the platform has zero government. As soon as someone takes ownership of the platform and decides who else can come onto the platform, governance begins.My hope, however, is that most of the governance will be blockchain based. As much as possible over time. Would such a thing be possible with decentralized governance? If there are 1000 new governments that consist of people that will float away if their government gets out of line, would some common outside model outside of the desire of the population be able to take hold? Do you think such a governance model would be able to compete with others? Would people actually voluntarily live on a seastead with that goal or would they float their home away somewhere else? A core structural feature of current models of government is centralization.Too much centralized authority leads to inefficient bureaucracies and representatives disconnected from the people they are meant to serve. Given a suitable technological solution, governments are ripe for decentralization. One technological solution is seasteading.Seasteading brings decentralization beyond the digital world of bits and into the world of atoms by providing modular, floating structures  seasteads  on which the evolution of new societies and forms of governance can occur. Promising solutions can branch off at any time by physically separating to create new seasteads  enabling a high level of evolvability and quick rate of adaptation. Mimicking natures time-tested method of variation and selection, the process of decentralizing governance through seasteading could spark the creation and evolution of new advancements in civilization. When our homes and businesses can float to locations we choose, we can relatively easily rearrange our cities and sail our residence to other locations. Governments would no longer have a monopoly on the space where citizens live and businesses conduct their commercial activities. Instead governments would need to act like service providers, competing to attract citizens and businesses. Consequently, we could have an ever-evolving marketplace for government in a decentralized world. Do you think such a thing is possible? Do you think other solutions for decentralizing governments could happen using the blockchain or other means? I'm actually heading to Thailand tomorrow to stay for about 2 months. Will be mostly in the Bangkok area. More free BTC from another forkcoin? Dancing girls all the time. It is the main hobby of most females here. The hope is to have this in as many countries around the world as will allow it. The key being that the government has to grant a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in one of its protected waterways.Blue Frontiers has opened discussions with other nations that are just as concerned about sea level rise, the fate of their people, their culture, and their homeland. Hmm...I do know what happens if it is that easy to transfer real wealth 2000 miles away instantly with a mouse click. I get my web hosting service paid for.But I guess my web hosting service has no value? So you're saying I should not have paid my hosting service any money for that service? They scammed me!?!Should I be shorting Google stock because all of their value is in digital services?The sad fact (for you) is that some ones and zeros have value. Just like the word yes or no in certain situations. Yes you got that job. That yes is a pretty great thing. A no would be bad. A picture made up of bits can be a beautiful thing. A whole lot of pictures and sound made out of bits makes some pretty spectacular movies. Saying that the movie is just a bunch of ones and zeros changes nothing about the experience.I'm not sure how you're even sharing your information about those ones and zeros across thousands of miles without ones and zeros. I think in Thailand you have to be a citizen to buy...you can lease, which is what most foreigners do. Actually most marry a local and the wife buys the property. Giving up your US citizenship comes with an exit fee plus you have to pay taxes on all of your assets as if you sold them right then (even without selling it). You can take the foreign earned income exclusion which is about $102k if you are outside of the US for 330 days out of the year.The thing is, that's different from capital gains tax...no exclusion there.I have tried every avenue to turn my bitcoin capital into income. My original idea was to give/loan/etc. my bitcoins to a foreign company in Turks & Caicos (allows for a single owner of a company, 0% capital gains and income taxes).But there is a law in the US where if you have over 10% ownership in a company and they sell any capital, you have to pay taxes on it as if you yourself sold that capital.I considered a Charitable Remainder Trust that allows you to put your money into a trust with a certain amount going to a charity upon your death with the rest held by the trust and you can earn income from that. But with that you have to hand over control of all of that money to another entity to invest with no input from you. Part of your investment would be held for the charitable contribution.Instead I am just hodling until the US collapses. I can cash out (spend) about $37k of my bitcoins each year and pay no taxes. I am a minimalist so that is plenty for me. Was going to say not to quote the troll but another problem gold and silver has is my situation as a digital nomad traveling the world. How do I pack up all of my belongings and relocate to my next country (as I tend to do) with all of my gold in my suitcase? The amount of bitcoins I have I can protect with some steel plates and information in my head. I can carry them through even countries like Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam without worrying about them getting stolen or having security confiscate it at the airport. To carry the amount of gold or silver equivalent to how much I have in bitcoins...well, actually I literally could not carry it.I have no idea how I would pay my hosting service every month with gold. Or buy my plane tickets, book my hotel rooms, buy stuff on Amazon, etc.I haven't needed to open a bank account here in Tahiti thanks to Bitcoin...I don't need to go to the rip off exchanges in the countries I visit. The rate charged at the local exchange from USD to CPF is literally 20%.  True, there was a movement of textile workers back in the 1800s when weaving machinery was being used to replace the workers. They protested and ended up smashing some of the machinery to stop the take over and save their jobs. The Luddites, as they were known, ended up winning and their jobs were saved. That is why all textiles to this day are made by hand. With millions of people employed as textile workers.Same thing happened with Gutenberg's printing press. The scribes of the day protested and their managers backed down saving all of their jobs. Thanks to them we all read hand written books and if you are skilled as a scribe it is very easy to find a job. I doubt that there are many people out there that don't know that Ebola exists. It was on the news a few years ago scaring everyone making them hide in their homes.But, I'll do my part for social awareness right now.Ebola exists.#ebolaawareness I remember when social awareness was just called education. Or being educated.But I guess it's not PC to say someone is educated because there are soooo many stupid people out there that at most they can be aware of things. My social awareness duty for the day: there is breast cancer out there. There, now you are aware. #breastcancerawareness I paid mine. Long and tedious, especially with the high amount of bitcoin spending I do.I didn't use any bitcoin tools to do so so it took a lot of hand jamming. The plan is to have seasteads all over the world and once they're in international waters there will be no visa requirements (other than local requirements).
Well, the site won't mention most of the engineering that is being worked on. There have been many solutions worked on for waste and the goal is full recycling of the waste integrated with hydroponics and food growth. The tricky part will be desalination and not dumping excess salt back into the lagoon which would change the salinity of the water. We may be able to export salt if we can get a process for preparing it for consumption or even use for other things. Much of the water will be gathered from the rain but depending upon storage and different times of the year that may not work all of the time. The waste and food systems guys we have are brilliant and do this stuff for a living.Here is an initial model of what they would like to have for the pilot project in a French Polynesian lagoon:This video gives some sea level views of the model:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPIKR8UDDgo I agree. Building something in middle of the sea is daunting and it will take several years before that will happen. It would be much better to do a gradual approach such as starting in a protected body of water like a lagoon or bay with calm waters. Get all of the logistics figured out there, the engineering, the social challenges, everything you can figure out while still within a safe distance of land to get through that first phase.Then you can move 12nm out into the ocean where you're still close to land for many supply/logistic type of things but you are challenged by the waves and other things, but at that point you have more national sovereignty. You're protected by the host nation's military but are outside of the jurisdiction of most of their laws which allows you to experiment even more with new social structures.Then finally you move 200nm out where you have full sovereignty. At that point you're looking to start a nation and have to be out that far to get started. That is certainly a decade away for sure.This is the approach Blue Frontiers is taking. They will start in a protected lagoon off of one of the islands of French Polynesia. Then go from there. But the key is to at least get started so we're not waiting 100 years to finally start utilizing the 70% of the earth that is covered by oceans. So a few folks have asked to be kept up to date on the seasteading thing. I'll get into that and some of the reason why Youtube, Google and Facebook banned ICO ads.We (by "we" I mean Blue Frontiers mostly, I am just a volunteer and am not a paid employee I just help out because I like the project) started working on an ICO last July or August. Being a business of seasteading it was difficult to figure out how to legally raise funds. Being an actual company that will be selling physical products (seasteads) we could not create a utility token. All of the companies we talked to would do utility tokens but hardly any would do a security token (selling shares of the company). We had to talk to many different lawyers, the best in the US (in the crypto world). The uniqueness of a Singapore company with founders in several different countries building seasteads in French Polynesia and likely all over the world made everything very difficult with the lawyers and staying legal by selling shares of the company. There may be some things in the works but nothing that has been tested and vetted.I learned a lot about securities for those 6 months or so. Not only in the US but then we had to look at jurisdictions all over the world (since we would be selling to everyone in the world). The SEC came out with some guidance basically almost labeling all ICOs as securities. They even brought up the bounty programs that pay people to endorse or advertise their ICO. With a security there are all sorts of laws and rules when it comes to advertising which all of these people posting signature campaigns, bounty programs, etc. are violating those security laws. The same thing applies to Google, Youtube, Facebook advertising ICOs...they would need to evaluate each advertisement to make sure they're not violating those SEC laws. So they just decided to ban them all. One of the big things is that if you claim the token will be more valuable after it is first purchased, you are considered a security. Some company got hit by the SEC in December because one line somewhere online said that the token price might go up in the future. They had to pay back all of the money they raised.With all of this in mind Blue Frontiers decided to go with an actual currency to be used on the seasteads and be the only currency the company would accept for payment for anything on the seasteads (any private business on the seastead can accept whatever they want, but the company will only take the token as payment). So they will be limiting the amount and distributing a portion in the public ICO on May 15. The token name is Varyon (there were literally 2 other ICOs using the name Seacoin). The name Varyon is a play on the idea that there will be a varyation in governments on these seasteads. They will be starting their pre-sales this week with discounts of 5-15%. All of the nitty gritty is on their white paper.Being on the ground here in Tahiti...one small group in one of the cities we were considering wanted to use the project as an election time issue (oh no...the evil American billionaires want to come to our lagoon and dump toxic chemicals...and our mayor supports the project...he needs to go!). They aren't really in one of the preferred locations but we decided to tone things down locally until after the election (first election is next week and then the run off is mid-May). This isn't a discussion about an alt coin, it's a discussion about seasteading.While Blue Frontiers is doing an ICO for their seastead token (Varyon), I'll leave Blue Frontiers to create a thread in the altcoin section to discuss Varyon.We need Bitcoin people to get involved in seasteading so that bitcoin can be an integral part in the blockchain based protocols on the seasteads for things like governance, voting, property registration, etc.  Maybe using something like Rootstock or other Bitcoin advances to do so. Implementing Lightning Network as the popular payment system for most seasteads.. It's not about no government.I see it as a blank slate with which you can create something great.Imagine every country's government as a painting. The country has chosen one painting as their national painting and it is that nation's painting. Maybe every couple of years they may add a tiny change or tweak a color, maybe a tiny dog in the painting did not have any eyes drawn originally and after years of discussion they decide to draw one white eye after much debate, though the painting essentially stays the same. This goes on for centuries with just a tweak here and there. They even decide that their style of painting is the best and that any other country choosing a different style is bad and they go to war over these differences.Meanwhile, artists all over the world look at these paintings and believe that there could be something better...the centuries old paintings are dull and boring. Warhol comes along, Picasso shows up...Dali wants to change things a bit. But they can't create anything new because there are no blank canvasses in the world. They might have great ideas but there is no place for them to express them. And the world doesn't get to enjoy their paintings.But then seasteading comes along and says...here are many blank canvasses. Try out some new paintings. Some will be shit because we haven't had any new paintings in hundreds of years. Some will copy the old paintings with some minor changes that other countries had already discussed. But some will be the Picassos, the Warhols, the Dalis...new and interesting. Unlike anything that has come before. Nothing that was allowed to come before. Hell, while old countries will be looking at paintings, we could be watching movies in full surround sound or in a VR world. Leaving them all behind to their legacy systems. Much like what we are doing with Bitcoin as money. For the final seasteads (out in international waters) you would likely move to a seastead because of the laws (or lack thereof). I suppose it will be like if you were go to Amsterdam right now. How do you know the drug and prostitution laws there? They're so different from the rest of the world. You just google it. There's probably a page for tourists for the basic stuff, then the actual full text of the laws on another website.I have lived all over the world. Before you get to a new country or soon after you arrive you do a bit of research on things you should know in your new country.As for how those laws are decided or implemented? I am hoping that it will be mainly blockchain based (for most of the cities...some may want to be old school, who knows) voting systems with public ledgers and verifiable proofs. The company was founded in January of 2017 and have been going strong ever since. A lot of work with the French Polynesian government, they have a partnership with a company out of the Netherlands that builds floating structures (Blue21). There are many partners being worked on with several big name advisers such as Ethereum's Daniel Nagy, Lara Stein (founder of TEDx), Gaspard Koenig (runs the premier libertarian think tank in France who advised the head of the IMF in France who just recently endorsed blockchain technology). The nice thing about this is that Blue Frontiers has first mover advantage. No competitors. The Seasteading Institute, which was founded by Patri Friedman and funded initially by Peter Thiel, has been around since 2008 but they merely promote the idea of seasteading and do research. They're non-profit so they can't actually build anything.  There will be an alt coin thread dedicated specifically to the token, Varyon.This one is for discussion of seasteading in general and the current project under way to make seasteading happen.It is Bitcoin and blockchain related in that most of the economy and governance will be blockchain based and Bitcoin will certainly be popular at most of the businesses along with basically any currency anyone wants to accept.I could see eventually some sort of basket of the most stable currencies being used, or some combination with metals. But that is the whole point of competing seasteads. They can figure out what is best.I'll leave the alt coin thread for the actual company, Blue Frontiers. I do not represent or speak for Blue Frontiers, I just support the project. The first seasteads will be in French Polynesia under French Polynesian criminal laws and military protection. I've also moved to Tahiti to see this project through so if I can do anything about it, this project will happen   Seasteading is the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea, called seasteads, outside the territory claimed by any government. The term is a combination of the words sea and homesteading.The basic premise is that if you don't like your government, you can float your house to another city/nation that is more to your liking. Essentially voting with your house.If you have any questions let me know, I've been involved in seasteading since 2008 and am currently volunteering for the The Floating Island Project in French Polynesia to get the world's first seastead up and floating by 2021. Reserved for FAQ: The Floating Island Project consists of constructing ecological floating platforms in a lagoon of French Polynesia that could offer a response to the challenges of rising sea levels and sustainable development.These platforms would also provide a basis for homes, offices and infrastructure to encourage the formation of vibrant communities and explore new ways of living together.At the same time, it will promote innovation in digital and marine technologies by creating an attractive destination benefiting from its unique framework.Blue Frontiers was founded in 2017 by members of The Seasteading Institute and a former minister of French Polynesia, Blue Frontiers has a diverse team from around the world, working on developing floating islands in French Polynesia.Blue Frontiers is making it possible to decentralize governance by launching a seasteading industry that will provide humanity with new options for organizing societies and governments. Seasteads will provide environmental resilience to the millions of people threatened by rising sea levels. https://www.blue-frontiers.com That timeline would give us the bottom in month or so. Then the long climb back up again. I always wonder about if there is a PIN or password required once he scans his hand.Otherwise someone can just walk past him down the street with an NFC scanner and get his bitcoins.The guy seems smart enough so I would imagine he has thought of that. I figure so many people give the shitty advice of "don't invest more than you can afford to loose" that there must be something to adding an 'o' so I would step it up with yet another 'o'. The smallest amount was probably 2 or 3 other people in the room. Usually one of those people was a co-worker who knew exactly what I was doing and would curse at me later for leaving him in there to endure the insanity. Don't invest more than you can afford to looose. The sad thing is that the price jump is probably someone with insider knowledge who knows the US is about to start a(nother) full out war. For a long time I considered living in a stealth sleeper van. I was going to paint it up like a plumber's van or something that nobody would care about sitting on their street.Doing my research a lot of people talked about how you should get a gym membership instead of installing a shower.Also, Walmart is the most friendly to people parking over night.
It is the smaller amount that is the hardest because if you are just one of 3 people they notice more than a group of 10.Usually it was the same guy going on and on about the same thing to two or three of us. I would inch my way to the door like I was still listening. Then lean on the door frame. Then the key was when there was talking back and forth...just slip to the side. From there I would walk quickly around the corner just in case. Once I was out the door I was home free.  If you can't get paid to do something you love, get paid to do nothing. Go work for the government Worked for me. I seriously stayed on an extra 6 months because getting paid a six figure salary to go screw around on the Internet 3-4 hours a day was so easy that I wondered why I should retire. I made a game of seeing how good I could get at disappearing from a room without anyone noticing when people were talking about work. But when the bitcoin price went up and my holdings went up by a year's salary in one day it really didn't make sense to continue. My bad. Wanted to buy 10 BTC but my key stuck and I bought 10000.oopsand yes, I just happened to have $70 million sitting on the exchange....rainy day fund Sudden $200 drop anyone? Personally I prefer as natural as possible. Was never vaccinated as a kid, was born at home, went to the medical doctor twice growing up (once for a broken collar bone and once for a broken arm), don't take anything to numb my teeth for cavities, I've never even had an aspirin. I avoided caffeine growing up and usually only get it through tea nowdays. I've been to doctors as an adult but it is usually some sort of checkup for work.I hardly ever get sick. If I do, there's usually a home remedy to help it (most often it falls to 'feed a cold, starve a fever'). I go to chiropractors often to stay healthy. I do fall into eating American food more often than I should. The chemicals in that shit are just as bad as most things out there. Been doing better here in Tahiti. I think part of the reason many Tahitians are fat is due to McDonalds being the only fast food restaurant here. And the locals flock to it.Not that I care what others do with their bodies, everyone around me smokes pot. They just know I don't want any and respect that (like civilized human beings). We had that fat chick, Lambchop, who was a financial commentator posting pictures of gay old men. Making fun of us because we chose Bitcoin instead of the obviously superior fiat. Literally every country in the world has had a bank announce this. Then declare that Bitcoin is banned in that country.We need a press release stating that bank transfers have been banned in <insert country here>. The article will state that the developers of the Bitcoin protocol from <insert country here> have decided not to implement the slow bank transfers into Bitcoin and any such attempt would not be allowed on the network. Those are Soros clones signing up to short bitcoin.  One of the worst industries is about to be disrupted. 12288 game: July 4, 2018 To be honest I don't post that many things that are merit worthy....mostly just random BS that doesn't add much. With a few scattered useful posts for flavor.And the only reason my merit is high is because I don't give out very many. And when I do it's usually one at a time.  The fact that Vitalik called out Craig Wright makes me want to buy my first ethereums with the bcash I still have left. Is he saying "more baby sausage!"? Ya, he was already on the path of wealth. But I think going from a few million dollars to starting to think you will be a billionaire like Bill Gates or Mark Cuban will transform you.When I see prices going over $100k I go from just a guy that can retire and seek out my own passions to someone that could change the world in so many ways. I like to think I will still be a minimalist and continue to focus on evolving myself into a wise human being, but someone might fuck with me the wrong way and I might want to turn their whole world to shit by buying their town and then changing the name to "Joe Smith sucks balls". Just because I can.Ver has an idea that he is somehow linked to Satoshi and for some reason thinks his vision is down one path. He feels it is his duty to use his vast wealth to make things "right" the way he sees things. Then again, maybe it's all of the drugs. Money can change people. He went up significantly in wealth in a very short amount of time. I think the highest amount anyone in this thread has ever revealed is about .5 BTC. You have to give it to him though...he's pretty rich now after holding for 5 years.A vast majority of our discussions are on tax compliance and how best to follow the rules.It has been generally accepted that we all just go ahead and pay extra on top of any taxes earned just to be on the safe side. However nobody here actually gives any tax advice as we are not certified attorneys and that would be highly illegal, which is the last thing any of us want to do.Some discussion is on how to become an IRS agent as that is the ideal job for anyone and we all wish we could be one but we're mostly not smart enough for such a prestigious career. Definitely vulnerable to violence (as my friend told me when we went to a place where it was only locals..."stick with us just in case").Fortunately on the seastead I will have my 3D metal printer to print as many guns as I want. I jumped off a bridge when the price dropped.It was a foot bridge...2 feet above the water. Got my shoes wet  
That's because so many of us have to pass through "gun free" zones. Making ourselves vulnerable to mass shooters. I was looking at the huge sell wall on the bottom that appeared briefly. I would be such an engineer...though my DB skills are not the best. Never have been. Was observing the wall and saw this thing pop up for a quick second: We were looking into putting a bitcoin ATM at the airport here.But again...it comes down to the fact that there is no exchange here. People putting their CFP into the machine and getting bitcoins would mean I would need to take that CFP and convert it to bitcoins. At the moment the way to do that is to wire CFP into Euros to a bank in Europe and then wire your euros to a European bitcoin exchange.Same process for getting BTC to CFP.We already have the government contacts for the seastead. We will see if we can talk to the same folks about allowing a Bitcoin exchange. Interesting. I did see some kid here use Payeer as his Bitcoin wallet. But I think he used it for some dollar transaction or something.Edit: After checking it out I can't transfer CFP to it.I was told there's no local credit cards. Just a bank type of card. I am starting to realize that the very obvious problem here in French Polynesia when it comes to crypto is that there is no bitcoin exchange here.I am considering changing that. I will be talking to the heads of the three banks here in Tahiti along with regulators to get a feel for how much resistance I will run into if I put up an exchange.If all goes well, are there any open source solutions out there to give me a template to get started on setting up an exchange? It would seem that with so many exchanges being hacked there would be some open source out there so more eyes can be on it. So...how can I access my 513 coins?Bitcointalk wallet? At least we're past the Swamps of Anger. Double bottom perhaps? Well, I guess that's the end of Bitcoin.Time to buy bank stocks. I think they're really going to take off...I saw one bank now has $20 wire transfer rates that only take 4 days. What a deal! I showed my gf how to sell bitcoins on localbitcoins in Thailand. The last few days have been quite active. She made $30-$40 per day the last few days.Considering the average monthly income there is about $300 she's doing pretty well. She was able to work her way up to 1 BTC while only pulling out money occasionally to pay for things.  Probably better that the weak hands sell off at these prices.At higher prices their weak hands would have more affect on the price. Someone said we would go down to $7,200... some high volume on the dip I'm a one trick pony when it comes to charts. I look for the closing triangles. This one looks pretty straight forward. In early April we either crash hard or go back into bull mode. Seems like there are big fast pushes down followed by a slow movement upwards followed by another big push down. It's that trickle upwards that shows what most of the market sentiment is. The big pushes down are either big sell offs or someone trying to make some money on a short. Looks like we're at the bottom of the cup. I walked up to some guy with a gun last night, pushed him to the ground and took his wallet out of his pocket. Took half of his money and threw the rest in his face.Then I went and used half of that money to pay for some kid to take some online courses in basket weaving. The rest of it I blew on hookers.Was it theft or a tax when I took that guy's money? I do not consent.
Classic.The outcome determines the morality of the act.Have sex with a woman without her consent. She ends up pregnant and the baby grows up to cure cancer.Was the sex rape? It is not whether you deserve it or you have a right to it. You have created a private agreement between individuals to do X for Y. That is all. Just an agreement between two people.If I have bitcoins and want someone to create a painting for me for 1 bitcoin I make an agreement with an individual to do so. The person does it and I send him the bitcoin, what moral right does anyone else have to interfere with this private agreement between us?The question comes down to "do you own your own body?". If you believe the state owns your body, then you are a slave to the state and nothing you do is your own life, you are merely granted permission to do things by the state. If you actually do own your body then you own the product of your own labor.Some radical socialists would tell you that you do not own your own body. This is an extreme position. So many of these peoples' minds are going to be blown away when they start seeing seasteads running their governments with no forced taxation."But that's a special case!" they'll say "they don't have a huge military like my country!" they'll say. So many excuses they will create to hold dear to the idea that has been drilled into their brains their whole lives that taxation is necessary for government.Propaganda since you are a child with your first coin. Spread by our fellow citizens no less. Many collectivists likely believe that is art. How much extra do you pay? Or do you not have enough pride to go beyond the suggested amount? Have you ever heard of Bitcoin?Do you understand there are alternative ways of paying for things?  Don't you think the ancient method of using force could possibly be replaced by a voluntary system?No...not likely. Most people can't think beyond what they are told. How much extra do you pay each year? If you pay your taxes voluntarily (not just to stay out of jail)...why don't you pay more than the suggested amount?If you pay without consent, have you ever looked up the definition of extortion?extortion/ɪkˈstɔːʃən/noun1.the act of securing money, favours, etc by intimidation or violence You would be surprised by the amount of people who believe that it is only the outcome that matters...not the act itselfA whole thread of people for example:Is taxation theft? You know best. You might want to tell the people in this thread that the outcome does not matter...it is the act itself.Is taxation theft? So...the outcome is what determines if the act is theft or not.Got it.Could you please go tell the people in this thread that it is the outcome of the act and not the act itself that matters? They are a bit confused.Is forcing a woman to have sex considered rape if the woman has an orgasm? Well, the law is the law. If they make you do it then it's not rape. Hmm, there is a whole thread of people who have concluded that it absolutely does matter what happens in the outcome. The outcome determines the label of the act as rape or not.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1732082.0You cannot say no. The results are far too important for you to say no!Do you want people to never have orgasms? No more sex? That would mean no more children and the end of humanity as we know it! Absolute anarchy! You will not believe the amount of people in this thread that disagree with you:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3114570.0One person even says:Countries that recognise theft outside of the pre-defined parameters of statutory theft will probably focus on the issue of consent/agreement. Hence, in many countries it will not be possible for government agents to tax a person and it not be considered theft. SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions.SHA-256 is used in several different parts of the Bitcoin network:Mining uses SHA-256 as the Proof of work algorithm.SHA-256 is used in the creation of bitcoin addresses to improve security and privacy. Probably should ask in Dev but you folks are hip to the latest things...Is there a way to automatically forward from an address you control to another address? Like some perpetual address locking mechanism?I'm looking at Rootstock. The way it works (as far as I can tell right now) is that you send from your wallet to a designated Rootstock controlled Bitcoin address.At that point the bitcoins are locked and the same amount of Smartcoins are released on the Rootstock network back to the address of the wallet you sent from (again, I have no idea if this is reality). So now you have control of your Rootstock smartcoins because you know the private key of the originating address.You can do all of your smartcoin stuff, then when you want them back in bitcoins you send to a designated Rootstock exit address and coins are released to an address you sent from on Rootstock (maybe that's how it works?).I was wondering if there would be a way to send from one address to another on the Bitcoin network but have it go through Rootstock, do some filtering or whatever and come back without needing to run wallet software to move it along. Ouch...that's big ass dildo sort of rape right there. Also...I can't just give up my citizenship without being severely raped for doing so.  Working on it!https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/tokensaleJust like women can choose to live in a place with only women if they don't want men raping them. They alone choose to live in a place they get raped which men in that society agree is ok (depending upon the outcome). This person would contend that it is considered rape only in that instance based on this post:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1732082.msg32155175#msg32155175because...it is the outcome that determines what the act was.
Someone just brought up a great point here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1732082.msg32865002#msg32865002Another way to look at rape is like when you have consensual sex. Nobody would say it's rape if they had consensual sex, but for some reason people seem to think differently when it is non consensual. I know right!? The end justifies the means.Please go and explain to all of these losers in this thread that it's not really rape if the woman has an orgasm afterwards.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3114570.0They're under the misguided illusion that for some reason a non-consensual act is a bad thing....but like you said...just think of the outcome first to determine if the act is bad.Another way to look at rape is like when you have consensual sex. Nobody would say it's rape if they had consensual sex, but for some reason people seem to think differently when it is non consensual.So wise! All of us veterans have known about that link to child porn for half a decade.We also figured out back then that having a link to something does not mean you have something.That was back when threads on this forum were relevant and we discussed things. Instead of being just tools to get peoples' signature campaigns post counts. I asked my investment advisor in 2011 if I should invest in Bitcoin. He just laughed (after I explained what it was). He was like...."you Ron Paul guys...". yes! I'm going to go back and add posts to really screw with everyone. For posterity: Bitcoin price is $8950  FTFY Welcome to Bitcoin!Have you read the white paper?Here you gohttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfIt's a great place to start in your quest to understand Bitcoin. What if....Bitcoin was just a big ploy by the developers of Dragonballz to promote their show?This whole time!That's why the price keeps going back under and over 9000.It's been a long time coming but well done gentlemen. Diamonoid teeth will be awesome! Good to see the price moving up.I finished my fast and I'm feeling great...full of energy on a couple of Tahitian bananas. Maybe I'll set up a detox resort on the seastead when it gets built.Speaking of, we have the roadmap for the seastead in place https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/tokensale (page just went live, I bring info to you guys first  )From the ground I am hearing very good things but we are trying to stay out of the public eye due to the elections in May (we don't want to become an election time issue). After the election the party that supports us is slated to win big time, we'll ride that victory through a sale to raise funding for the project. Just remember what the whales did to gold in the US. Perhaps they can have another meeting on Jeckyll Island about how to help you with your bitcoins.You also get the legacy finance folks seeping into our thread about Bitcoin talking about ponzi schemes. Welcome to Bitcoin!Have you read the white paper?Here you gohttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfIt's a great place to start in your quest to understand Bitcoin. The only good news from government is when they don't do much. Which was the case this time. Shorting pagecount? I don't know why everyone obsesses about governments regulating Bitcoin.Ever since I figured out it was a good thing I assumed they would eventually try. But I also realized that once you have them they can't do shit about that.That was a big motivator to get as many as possible while still possible.The music will stop and those holding fiat will be the ones that lost. Not sure if today is historic but I think I may have made the first bitcoin trade in French Polynesia. I'm sure there may have been some sailors at bars showing someone how it works or whichever. But I did a localbitcoin trade and I have kept my eye on the FP market on localbitcoins for the past year and nobody was selling.I do know that some locals have crypto, I met up with the local blockchain group. But they have to send their money off to a bank account in Europe then send it to Kraken to get their BTC. All with high fees. Well, actually I charge high fees too (because that's what you do when you have a monopoly on a market and can get away with it). I actually welcome competition and a thriving bitcoin community. Maybe my high fee will encourage some local that it is a good way to make money.French Polynesia has a $5 billion GDP. So...time for the seed to spread and convert that $5 billion into bitcoins for future generations to enjoy. Welcome to Bitcoin!Have you read the white paper?Here you gohttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfIt's a great place to start in your quest to understand Bitcoin.
Come on guyz...I'm sure the politician that decided to subsidize electricity had her heart in the right place. You can't expect unintended consequences to happen with government interference. This would be the first and only case where that has happened. I hope I don't devolve into someone who would drive a Lamborghini. When I was 12 I might have wanted one.Here I am just selling about $1k (in francs) worth of bitcoins here in Tahiti wondering if I could get a really cheap car for that much or if I should hold out and wait to see if I get another buyer to push me up to $1500. I'd do a scooter but I'm an amateur on those things. Considering there are...what...3 companies that control all of US media...they have it pretty much in the bag on how they can manipulate things. I read it...the dude is chillin in the sun sippin on some blended tacos. Livin it up! Highest volume for today was at the $7520 low. Could be a good thing. I haven't eaten in 6 days.Actually on purpose...but it is appropriate. Maybe at the 10 day mark I will finish the fast and the sun will once again shine on Bitcoin. Like how after Jesus fasted for 40 days he came out and everything worked out just fine... As we said on the way up, buying an alt is like buying BTC on margin. Great when the price is going up but on the way down...not so good. I'm surprised at so many Legendary posters here today. I guess the n00bs all ran back home to their fiat.And the legacy finance trolls have not yet created their new accounts.The rest of us are here for an online support group.Chins up gentlemen! It has worked very well for me over the past few years of traveling the globe. Sometimes I cannot understand how the plebes spend money in foreign countries. Do they go to the airport currency exchange all the time and get reemed on the rate? BBQcoinyou can buy BBQ sauce with it! Yes, I'm hoping this is the case. Though I am prepared for a hold out until 2020 just in case.My bottom for my retirement number is about $3500. But even if it dips below that for a little while it's all good. An Error Has Occurred!Invalid amount Which way the price goesUp or down nobody knowsYou should hodl bitcoin I hate to say it but this looks like another long term downtrend like we get after all of the huge spikes in price. It might end up that we have to wait until late 2019 for a reversal as we start to near the next halving.Either way I will hodl because trying to time the market and play like a trader has never done well for me. It's always been best to just buy and hodl.We will shoot up past $19k probably in 2020 but until then, get ready for the long winter. There was an ethereum conference in Mexico. They gave the attendees their own floor with keycard access and upped security for the event. So, I'm no TA expert or anything but...the fact that the new low was higher than the last low would indicate to me that the floor is rising over time.I could post fancy charts to explain it but I think this will give you an idea of what I'm talking about:___/ I think I am at the point where I can sell off all of my bcash but I don't see any more Ver/Wu pumps anymore. I usually wait for those and sell at .2 BCH/BTC during those pumps. At this point it's around .1.    Back during the 2008 elections I was admin on a site called TheObamaForum. It was basically a bunch of libertarians trolling both sides.We put up a fake thread (acting like Obama supporters) with the OP saying that once Obama was elected we can go after all of the anti-Obama websites, he asked for people to start listing the websites that would go on the list of sites to be shut down after Obama was elected. We, as our fake admin accounts, listed several conservative websites including Alex Jones' website.A few days later Alex Jones reported on his show about how those Obama folks were planning on shutting down his website if he gets elected.If you spent about 2 minutes on the website, after you got over your first shock and awe, you would see that it was a bit over the top. Planning for FEMA camp attendees, take away all the guns, report your parents if they didn't support Obama, etc...Just proved to me that Jones doesn't put much effort into vetting his sources. In case you missed it the price of bitcoin went to 2800000 on Tdax Friday.http://bitcoingirlthailand.com/2018/03/11/fat-finger-trade-on-bitcoin-exchange-sends-the-price-to-2-8-million-baht-about-90k-btc/ I stopped trying to get the average Joe to buy bitcoins when I realized that they were the ones that got us into this mess in the first place by going along with the crowd as I saw more people trying to call for Bitcoin regulations so the price would go up. 
For those that believe taxation is not theft...Please answer this thread asking if forcing a woman to have sex is rape if the woman has an orgasm:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3114570.0I am sure you will be consistent. Here is a thread full of people who believe that it is only the outcome that matters...not the non-consensual act:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1732082.0 Even better:If you rape a woman, who then gives birth to a child that grows up and cures cancer...was it still rape?It is not rape because there was a benefit from the act.The outcome is what matters in defining rape, not the act.It depends upon how much force is used for the sex to determine if it was rape. If it was not a lot of force used then it was not rape.If the person who raped you is bad/corrupt, then it can be considered rape. If the government rapes you legally, it cannot be considered illegal. Rape is only the illegal act of forcing someone to have sex. It is the price we pay to live in a civilized society. I had 4 years of french in high school but that was about 20 years go...so I can get by but not conversational yet. Sold to some kid on localbitcoins who didn't speak any english. I was able to get through the sale without too much difficulty. Especially with google translate. Just enough for pocket money. No baguettes and only shadows of palm trees...but this was my breakfast yesterday morning just outside of my bedroom.And the sunset on the first day I moved in (before I started cleaning up the beach) Or a seastead. I'm starting to get excited here in French Polynesia about things moving forward on that front. Good things coming soon (tm). Fat finger trade sends the bitcoin price to $90k in Thailand.http://bitcoingirlthailand.com/2018/03/11/fat-finger-trade-on-bitcoin-exchange-sends-the-price-to-2-8-million-baht-about-90k-btc/ Yep. Checked again price shot up to 2800000. Price was around 280000 at the time. Tdax.com An interesting thing happened on the lower volume Thai exchange when the price was coming down. Someone bought all of the bitcoins. All orders were filled. I saw 600k baht orders go through (very small amounts). That's about 20k USD. I am not sure if someone fat fingered it but then the price dropped down to around 200k baht.Fortunately I had put in a small sell for my gf at 397k baht a while back so she could take money out for rent. When the price stopped rising around 340k I told her to keep the order there and use some other money. I told her the bitcoin price is like the weather in Michigan, if you don't like it right now just wait a bit. Been busy SCUBA diving in Tahiti. Noticed the price is down a little. Locals wanting to buy from me. Me telling them I don't sell the dip. Will have to hold off on pocket money for a few. Been in Tahiti for almost a month now to work on that. Exciting times ahead. After all of these years, someone finally implemented my idea.http://bitcoinist.com/strippers-now-sporting-bitcoin-tattoos-tipping/ When the price is at $9975 and it goes up $25 I'm happy.Another $300 up and I'm like...meh No love is given to the 3rd Amendment.   Bitcoin is dead. Time to dust off that resume and go work for Warren Buffet or George Soros. I've been waiting to be verified for 6 months (actually about a year since I started on the old site). How the hell does one get verified? Any user that had their account locked cannot get their account unlocked and WEZ is keeping their money.How do we track down these scammers in Russia? Haven't any of the hacker community been able to track their IPs or anything like that?If anyone knows of a way to make this happen, there are many of us that are locked out that would like to know. Problem, meet solution. Not many fast food workers in Australia Not to get into a statistics war over something that is actually a matter of power and control (see: freedom) but...Once the government disarms then we can talk about disarming its citizens.
We're trying to get bcash back to .2 BTC by bringing the price to bcash since bcash isn't bringing the price up to bitcoin. Doesn't seem to be working though :/ I wonder what proportion of the flat earthers are actually trolls, getting Youtube hits from people going there to view their insanity or prove them wrong. Or just for the lolz.As for me, I've circled the globe and every time I look down from the airplane window, what do I see? A flat earth.</QED> Being retired I find myself needing to justify myself every once in a while when I do absolutely nothing all day.I'm retired bitches, do you know how many working days I have looked forward to waking up, doing absolutely nothing, taking a nap, getting up and doing absolutely nothing then going to sleep early at night? Some days I do that on principle. Because I can.Sure I'll eventually get bored of that and do more productive things, but give me my moment here... Thanks.I think the story would have made a good movie in its time but I'm not sure if people are still curious about who Satoshi is. Especially after Wright came in and basically shit on the whole concept. So...finex is down and stamp is up.Is this due to a jump in shorts? itBit is best for large amounts On the equity thing on the blockchain I think colored coins could work out easily, it's just an entry on a ledger just as good as an entry in some Wall Street database or a line in a book somewhere. The US folks would want to limit who can trade them though, I delved into the legality of Securities far too deeply this past year and the US has very stringent rules (which the rest of the world tends to follow) on whom can or cannot invest.I am starting to think about the possibilities when combining colored coins and Lightning Network. Perhaps some super easy way of moving your equity, buying/selling on the cheap, perhaps some sort of simple atomic swap from bitcoin to smaller quantity bitcoin (colored coin). I wonder also about the lowest amount of satoshis that could represent the smallest quantity of an equity and still be able to send that over the network.It can probably be done easier via Rootstock but I'm still trying to track down how easy it is for a user to go from bitcoin to a token on the RSK blockchain. Rootstock had a testnet up for a while in 2017. The mainnet went live in January on the birthday of the Bitcoin genesis block. Mainnet is still in beta which means that they are whitelisting the projects that are running on it (this probably means only revealing the federation address to a few projects that are helping to debug). They said this will be opened up to everyone in a few months. Colored coins might be possible but a smart contract would still be required. I wouldn't use an ethereum token because I don't want to go down that path and confuse users with ethereums. I would be fine with another Bcash pump. I am finally settled down in one place where I can take the time to pull out my cold storage wallets and convert my BCH to BTC.So pump that shit up to .2 BTC for me please. As I delve deeper into Rootstock I'll share some of that knowledge with you fine folks.Rootstock is basically a one for one sidechain of the Bitcoin blockchain. To get RSK coins you send your bitcoins to a BTC address that then locks those coins and releases those coins on the RSK blockchain for you. There is a federation of nodes that handle this part right now. There is a Drivechain OP_CODE that Satoshi turned off at one point that RSK hopes to get turned back on so that they can handle the process partially with miners and partially with federated nodes.Once you have RSK coins (I have heard them called Smart Bitcoins) you can use a smart contract just like on Ethereum.One interesting thing, at least for what I am looking to do, is the federation is also creating what they call "oracles". It is a way for your smart contract to get real world information in a standardized way. For example they might share the BTC/USD price (based on some agreed upon criteria) so that all contracts that want to use that value will be on the same page. The oracles can be used or not. Each contract has to decide how much they trust the oracles.They're working on a layer that will allow for 20k transactions per second.It's currently being merge mined, the miners are paid by transaction fees (RSK.co gets their money from 20% of the miner fees).The mainnet is online, in beta testing mode. Beta testing mode means they are white listing contracts that are vetted and participating in their bug testing. After a few months of this it will be opened up to everyone.In my opinion the advantage is the oracle implementation which can help many of the currently centralized systems that exist become more decentralized until everyone is using a decentralized cryptocurrency. Plus you can keep your value in bitcoins instead of ethereums.I'm not completely sold on it yet and am mainly looking at it specifically for my project. I did see that they would have a java implementation soon instead of solidity which is nice since I am a java programmer. Though solidity is pretty straightforward. Strangely enough this is a 'thing' in the shoe market.https://www.ted.com/talks/josh_luber_why_sneakers_are_a_great_investment Nietsche touches on this in explaining people's drive for power. Firstly they seek to stay alive, that is their initial instinct that is the highest priority up until they are able to have kids. Then having kids becomes a very high priority. This along with the drive for your children to live on in successful lives (touching on the initial drive to stay alive after understanding that you will eventually die, you live on through your children). It does not mean one has to dominate the other, just that every species has these drives. Otherwise after one generation that species would no longer exist. I have run into this a lot, especially in foreign countries, when I need something and I am willing to pay for it. The difficulty of getting so many services makes me keep thinking in my head "do you hate money!?!". In Germany when I was looking for an apartment I felt like just driving down the street with a wad of euros in my hand shouting "I will pay you to rent a place, hell I'll over-pay!". I ended up just using AirBnB to find a place.  Under $10k, so ends Bitcoin.  The last miner please flip off the PoW. ....aaaaannnnnddd.....we're back Godaddy.com:ethereumcash.com is availableBuy Now Price$24,995.00* Let me get this straight...so Litecoin basically took the Bitcoin code and changed it to Proof of Stake and raised the max 4 times. Litecoin cash is taking the Litecoin code and changing it back to Proof of Work...and raising the max 10 times.Umm...makes total sense.4 guys listed as contributors...suddenly putting up a web page and Litecoin price goes nuts...Edit:Also, at the bottom of their web page under License:Copyright (c) 2017 bitcoincash.orgCopyright (c) 2018 litecoinca.sh If bitcoin doesn't break $9500 this week we all fail. as humans Their mainnet genesis block started in January.
I'm pretty much of the impression that any coin that targets people in Thailand and the Philippines is likely a scam.See: Bitconnect  Trading on margin is like dabbling in alt coins. This is what I read here. That is the ratio.With the corporate accounts being closed out they are closing their shorts.There might be one guy going long at $100 vs someone going short $5 with what's left. Instead of bitcoin users buying bitcoins they are creating 9k memes. While Wall Street is selling.Put away the Windows Paint and buy fools! Could happen. Bisq does p2p matching much like localbitcoins. They use their app to match people and one or two guys act as arbitrators in case of dispute.The idea is that there will be many arbitrators but when you look closer, it's basically the two guys that created the software. That's how they make money on it. Certainly a step in the right direction. I think it will be more like a decentralized Tether where you will do p2p like localbitcoins to get your crypto-fiat, but from there you can participate in crypto exchanges just as if you were on a regular exchange. Most people only put their money on the exchange or take it off once in a while. The p2p transactions would not be too frequent in that case. The difference being that they acknowledge that the centralization is a flaw that is temporary and needs upgrades to Bitcoin to evolve, while Ripple wants to be the next central banking sector. Interesting. Thanks for the heads up. It certainly has a long way to go but could be useful. Knowing Thailand I would not be surprised if it was all BCC. I am not believing that number. I guess instead of getting pictures next to huge piles of drugs and money they can just say "we found 20 million bitcoins on his computer". Re: Bitcoin is the biggest bubble in history. Glenn Beck even did a show about it.All they factor in is percentage rise, not market cap. Beck said that when the bitcoin bubble bursts it would be worse than the dotcom bubble and the housing bubble combined. Silly because there are so few people affected.If you want the biggest bubble in history I have one that is bigger.My brother had an ice cream cone when I was a kid. I told him I'd give him 1 cent for it. He said no. At that point the price per ice cream cone was $.01. Then I offered $1. He said no. So I offered him $10. Knowing I didn't have that much money he again said no. I then offered him $1 million for the ice cream cone. He said I don't have that much money. So I said I have 50 cents and offered him 50 cents for it.In the span of 5 minutes the price of one ice cream cone went up millions of percent and then the bubble popped and crashed. That was the biggest bubble in history. It should be recorded. The economic impact was felt for years after that, the recovery felt by all. There are over 250 million alt coins out there. If the average of each is $1 then they will have 65% of the crypto market cap.I started thinking that maybe there would be a limit on alt coins at some point to one per person then I started thinking that maybe people will start creating alt coins for their pets too.  Just started playing around with RootStock. I'm liking what I see so far. #1 on cmc you say? I'm in. When is the ICO? My new advice to friends is this:Find a restaurant nearby that accepts bitcoin as payment. Figure out the price of a nice night out at that restaurant (alone or with s/o). Buy bitcoins worth 10x that price.Every time your investment goes up by 10%...go treat yourself to a nice night out to celebrate. Don't spend more than the initial amount.There's a Hungarian fable about a restaurant table that has a never ending amount of food (something like that). This strategy gives you that table. So as to not get too excited about the price rise I would first go look at the 3day chart...then the 1 week chart...now I just watch the 1 month charge  I'm surprised that they're hitting corporate accounts. Those were supposed to be safe.They gave me a bit of trouble when pulling all of my money off of the exchange. Fortunately I'm not a US resident. Not that that has helped at all with wex.nz.
 It appears that with the amount of volume that came along with the $6k low it is definitely a solid floor. A floor that will rise over time, as bitcoin tends to do.If that's the lowest it goes from here on out I'd be quite pleased even if we're far down from the ATH. Next thing going up: charging stations I enjoyed the book that addressed this: We the Living Congrats.  btw....we're up 1.5% for the day!rocketrains.gif I will merit someone for anyone for .01 BTC per Merit.Get in while the price is low. ICO. Cheap Merits. These stories of personal gains and losses are shit stories. The fact that the price didn't even pause at $6666 on the way down nor on the way up means that it's the Wall Street folks moving the price.BTC folks love pricing at 666 for the lolz. Even better.Step 1: Open the charts on your laptop.Step 2: Turn your laptop 90 degrees counter clockwise.Step 3: Watch the price go up up up! About 1k BTC buy wall at $6k on finex. I know the Thai markets very well. They have very very little influence on bitcoin prices.I have considered moving one of my cold storage wallets to one of the Thai exchanges to move the price so one of my gf's orders would go through. It would be very easy. We got kicked off their main exchange because we deposited more money than their commercial account could handle in one day.If a Thai media corporation wanted lower prices they would just drop a couple hundred thousand worth of BTC on it and push the price down. Looking at the main exchange there are only about 5 BTC from here to $20k.    All I know is that I have enough in the bank to last until 2020. Then I buy islands. The price will probably stick at $6666 for a while. This. As a bitcoin spending advocate I had to finally stop spending bitcoins this past fall. I cracked open my credit card which I had used maybe a hand full of times in the past 5 years.I can go back to spending bitcoins again because the fees are so low. I see everyone keeps looking for news or blaming some FUD or the other for bitcoin's price drop.If this was about something having to do with bitcoin you would see the bitcoin price drop and alts remaining fairly stable.This is about major market sentiment. A cycle that has been seen throughout history and repeated itself once again. Big money moved in, the price started to climb so everyone and their brother started buying so they could get those sweet 1000% gains that they were promised. Then we topped out and the price started going down. This is not what we were promised!?! I was supposed to be able to retire by buying bitcoins at $10k! What's happening!?! I better get out of this thing I have no clue about quickly! Sell! Sell! Sell!The weak hands that have no clue will leave. But the big money will stay. They like volatility. We just fed the Wall Street beast the money of a bunch of ignorant n00bs and they will want more. They will play the market. They will get their money.That is why we hodl. We understand that we cannot time the market. We do not spend every minute of every day watching the patterns and charts and use our hundreds of millions to move the market. We sit back and let others do that for us and we hold out.All of my friends thought I was smart for buying so early. The smart part was not buying early, but not selling when the market was scary. Double bottom usually means the end of Bitcoin right?Is there an address I can send my bitcoins due to it coming to an end? That requires me pulling it out of cold storage and putting it back in....a long process that I usually can only stomach one at a time.
Sweet. I was hoping for another round of dumping my bcash. I usually move it when it reaches .2 BTC/BCH. That usually only happens during a pump. Communism is difficult when you can't take peoples' money. I'm not a trader but I have been helping my gf with localbitcoins. She had a huge order at $14k that was frozen on the exchange for amateur hour reasons as the price rose to $19k and she was sitting there with fiat that she couldn't buy back in.After finally getting the money to another exchange I set the buy order very low so that if it flash crashed to that price she would have a full bitcoin. It finally hit that last night. So hopefully it goes up from here and she can enjoy price rises as much as I do.   I seem to recall the exact same thing being said after the 2013 jump to $1200. I paid for a hotel room on Expedia when the price was at like $8600 or so.On the other hand, it's the first time I've spent bitcoins in a while because the transaction fees didn't make it worth it. I paid $300 for the room and only paid $1 in fees (could have lowered the fee if I wanted). If the price goes down to $6k I'm selling it all because obviously the graph will flip and the price will go negative. Nothing to do with any news.Just people. People hear that bitcoin price will go up forever so they buy in. Bitcoin price stops going up and starts going down so they sell.The snowball effect works the same when the price is going down as it does when the price is going up. Draw the same downward trend lines that were being drawn when the price was going up.I would love for the price to drop quickly so we can get back to a rebound but it will probably be long and drawn out. I met Russo when he was running for the LP nomination for president. Seemed kinda arrogant with his entourage like he was doing the LP a favor. Said his main reason for running was to keep Nolan from winning (I guess he had some conspiracy theory against him). That's the year the third place guy ended up winning the nomination. Can you PM me the address? If I have to hire a professional in Singapore to take care of this I will. The irony is that people running Lightning Network on mainnet are enjoying putting bcash folks in their place. Even though bcash tested their transaction solution on mainnet. So I have been thinking about the Lightning Network for a bit as far as running a node goes.From my limited understanding of it, if you are the node between 2 people you basically fund the transactions going through, they sign a transaction to you, you sign a transaction to them for the equal amount each (so you need twice the amount for the channel), then throughout the length of time of the channel being open you sign transactions back and forth with the people connected to your node then settle everything at the end or whenever someone wants to settle the balance.Firstly, is that somewhat accurate? I am sure it is super complicated beyond that, otherwise I would know it better.My question (if that is accurate) is, could I sign every possible transaction for each node connecting to me offline, then only move the signed transactions to a hot database that I pull the transactions from as needed? For example, A and B connect to me with 1 BTC each. I copy their public key to an offline machine and have it generate a million transactions each (or however many are needed) to account for every possible signed transaction then transfer that to a computer online.Also, if this is possible, what prevents me from signing all of those transactions then spending the bitcoins somewhere else. Or is this what SegWit fixed? The triangle closes around the 28th. I predict it drops down within this long term trend line. So...can we see some charts of triangles forming and where the convergence point is?This is the only chart formation that I understand. Unfortunately it just tells me that on a certain date the price will either go up or down. The bitcoin price 1!!1! The bitcoin price !!11! I'm starting to become addicted to online coffee. I need to stop but I can't. Please help. Would be interested in participating in a lawsuit against this company. They have essentially stolen all of my funds at this point. This makes more sense.I don't believe there are more than 31,000 people living in Norway. Maybe Santa and his elves make up a lot of the population but still. The price doesn't move based on good or bad news, it moves based on charts which reflect how investors invest based on the direction of the price.All of those n00bs that bought in thinking they would make 10x their money are now getting out because they didn't realize the price could go down.
Not first.Old news is old. So...the company is selling equity shares in their company...which is completely anonymous and purposefully makes sure nobody can track them down.This can be done openly and transparently via the blockchain. Just creating a website and hiding is not the way to start a company that illegally accepts securities investments. Perhaps a big short on finex? If you turn the charts upside down you can re-live yesterday.The more you know. Umm...oops.Does anyone know how to put corks back in champagne bottles? On the bitconnect front, I play around on the Thai exchanges and one of their lower volume exchanges quickly went from 450k THB to 225k THB (about $7,500). I'm not sure if it was bitconnect related but I know a lot of Thais were targeted for that scamcoin. Sold it all at $9940. Bitcoin is a fraud and if anyone working for me buys any they are fired. Looks like a lot of n00bs came into the crypto world to give their money to the rest of us and leave. They have a limit on their baht deposit each day on their business account. So if you take up too much of it they get touchy and ban you, even with more proof than you would ever need in the US. I even offered to meet them in person and give my full life story if needed.  That shows the percent gains going down every year.  What am I supposed to do when there is only 100% gain in one year? Edit: It also had the price predicted at $10,741 at the beginning of 2018...the low today was $10,779 so obviously the chart is way off. Sold it all at $10779, obviously Bitcoin is dead and will trade for less than $10 a share by the first half of 2018. After watching bitcoin's price climb throughout the years thousands of percent I must say that this time the <whatever the FUD is for the price going down this week> should spell its doom and the smart money will get out now because there's no way it will ever break another all time high. Bitcoin hardly ever surpasses previous ATHs, it is a rare site indeed. Ironically I was more pro-PMs before reading Roach's posts. Someone needs to create a new alt...Warcoin. Decentralized war. No more centralization of war...more wars, more efficient, more deaths...more coins with Warcoin. Do not register at bx.in.th. If you have any significant funds at all they will freeze your account. They will spend weeks going back and forth with you trying to get you to prove the source of your funds, no matter what proof you give they will constantly say "need more proof" while they keep your money. What is the location for WEX.nz? Is there a person or place I can fly to and verify in person that I am myself?What would be the next level for me to take to get funds out of my account? I finally got a Trezor mainly because it seemed like the easiest way to put my money in a Segwit wallet. Plus I opened my blockchain.info wallet on my phone one day and it had over $1m on it (forgot that I synched it a while back). Biggest problem with Bitcoin is always its interaction with fiatcoin. Done and done. There is a step between having a paper wallet and sending it to the exchange.You have to import your private key into a hot wallet before sending it to the exchange. When you send less than 10 bitcoins to the exchange, depending upon your hot wallet software, you will either get the remaining coins in a different address or it will go back to your original address (blockchain.info).Either way, once you import your private key to a hot wallet...it's no longer secure. You need to go through the process to put it on a paper wallet again.
Should check localbitcoins. Umm...if they have the private key for the BCH address you sent it to...they now have BTC...worth a whole lot more.Perhaps this is their plan.Plus, the whole "use exact amount" thing is like 2011 way of tracking payments. Ask him if he'll be setting up a Lightning Network node.  I have no idea. All I know is "You applied for verification. Wait for approval." (message I have been getting since October 2017). Taxation is a way to fund things.It is not the only way.And it is certainly not the best way. Isn't the very act of stalking someone creepy in and of itself? Not what is due to Caesar...He said "who's image is on that coin?"...Caesar's..."so...give to Caesar what is Caesar's". The coin belongs to Caesar so you should not use it. Give it back."Who's name is on the US dollar?"...The Federal Reserve..."so...give to the Federal Reserve what is the Federal Reserve's".Stop using dollars. Use bitcoins.Jesus wanted us to all use bitcoins and not use fiat. Ahh...looks like FinShaggy's back with more dictatorial ways of "we're going to create a town that is free...and this is how everything in this town will be done...MY WAY!!!" BBQcoin is the superior coin because it can be traded for BBQ sauce. I am a retired software engineer that has been in the Bitcoin world since 2010. My girlfriend buys/sells bitcoins in Thailand and I am in no way impressed by the exchanges there. I hope to get the ball rolling soon on a better exchange. My thinking is along the lines of McAfee's prediction of $500k in 2020...I figure the price will jump 10x after the halving to hit that number which would put the price at $50k at the beginning of 2020. So I would have to choose something between now and $50k for 2019. The default guess should always be guessing that the price will be today's price since it is a known number. So I just threw a number between $13k and $50k that is closer to $13k.Then again, who the hell knows. random(1000,1000000) I have never been close on these predictions so I will just throw out a number (that will be wrong):$25,000 Looks like none of us were even close.Closest was ErisDiscordia with his scientific approach to prediction. How long is verification supposed to take?I started the verification process in September...in October they responded saying they wanted a scan of my passport (I had sent a picture).So I re-applied in October with the passport scan and have been waiting ever since.I had purchased 21k NMC in 2014 on btc-e. Didn't really care to log in for a year or so because the price had slowly gone down over time so I wasn't too worried about it.Are they purposefully not allowing me to log in because of how much I have on there?Is there no way to get my coins?(yes, I know...don't leave your coins on the exchange...but at the time it was just a worthless alt) Can these alt fork coins please just convert my coins to BTC for me and just send them to my current address?OK? Thank's in advance! lambo for sale...will take war bonds or treasury notes    haha...DOGE     funnyNo withdrawals or exchanges were allowed once they froze the account.I am working on an alternative for Thailand. Better to spend bitcoins than have fiat to spend. The bitcoin wallet on my Purse.io account has perpetual money.  I spend money once in a while, then go to spend again and there is even more money in there than the last time I bought something.Just bought a Trezor at a 23% discount. No straight raise to $10 million in the next 2 days? Is that you Yellen? Rothschild shill!
itBit does OTC very well...that's how I got my bitcoins when I sold my house last year. Usually around $50k a trade.The limitation was the bank only allowing $25k wire transfer per day. Was just in NZ yesterday. Well..Aukland airport  I am in Tahiti now looking for a place.French passport would suck but hopefully we can do something with a seastead citizenship. thisDoes anyone remember computers? You used to have your money set aside to buy a computer...you go to the store and buy one, then a month later you find out that the same computer money has more value now, the computer you have is worth a lot less and you could have something better...if only you didn't spend that money on the computer and waited.I guess the ad geniuses didn't think that through when they came up with those gizmos. !!!WARNING!!!!!!DO NOT USE BX.IN.TH!!!!I loaned my Thai girlfriend some bitcoins to trade in Thailand and because it was "so much money" they locked her account. They wanted her to prove that I loaned her the bitcoins. I have no idea what type of proof they wanted, we wrote up an official document signed and witnessed, I even called them but they would not take anything as proof and they closed the account.Fortunately she got her money off of the exchange because they increased their withdraw price to .002 BTC! Obviously there is something going wrong with the exchange if they are discouraging people from withdrawing their money with such high fees. Stay away from that exchange. They are bad news, their customer service is horrible and they treat you like shit because they can once they have your money. Because they can. The current downward swings will always be bad because people are investing with the idea that they will get 1000% gains in a short amount of time. Weak hands everywhere.  Nobody will spam attack Bcash because nobody cares enough about that alt coin to try to replace it with their own forked version.  Most were likely Ethereum folks just hoping to divide and conquer.Until Rootstock and Tezos push them out of the picture. I actually prefer this fad of bcash trolls over the doge trolls of yesteryear. Seriously, the doge phase of crypto was so annoying. Like satellites. Bitfinex allows exchange of Bcash with no withdrawal limits of BTC.Don't keep anything on there too long though. The mandate was why I left the US.Now it can be a possibility of returning...not likely though. Welp, it looks like Bcash is the clear winner.Can anyone tell me the steps I will need to take to set up a Bcash Lightning Network node? Is their testnet setup for this yet? Just a quick note about Bitfinex that doesn't give me the fuzziest of feelings.I pulled off about a quarter of my holdings on Monday. That day they sent out a message to everyone about how US residents using their service were in violation of their terms of service (I thought it was just to me which made me feel a bit uneasy as I was waiting for the withdrawal to be approved).Yesterday I submitted the withdrawal for the remainder of my bitcoins. They did some checking on my account because they responded to a past e-mail I sent asking if US citizens that were not residents were in violation of their terms of service (they assured me I was not). The e-mail was saying that they wanted me to set up 2FA (I assume to verify what my residency is). Such digging into my account should not need to happen for a simple withdrawal of bitcoin. Ya...big announcement. I tend to post my thoughts on current price all the time in the Wall Observer Thread.Those were my thoughts. I closed the short based on what I thought of the price. I've been wanting to close it for a while since the price can pretty much go down to $2k at this point and I still won't have to worry about my retirement so I'm pretty much locked anyway. The ease which we went from $17k to push over $20k showed that it's not a barrier.Definitely don't ever trade based on any of my posts. Half of my posts my tongue is firmly placed in cheek. Still don't see any reason why 20k would be a barrier since some of the exchanges went over. 15% drop after 1000% gain is just another dip. Same thing happened at $17k. If you short bitcoin with bitcoin without leverage you basically lock in the current price. I locked in a portion of my bitcoins for retirement this way instead of selling. To sell I would pay capital gains on the sale.But for people doing this I would advise that you check the tax requirements for short sales, it is likely that you have to close the short before January 30:http://thismatter.com/money/tax/short-sales-taxation.htm I had a bunch of cash and a lot of shorted coins on Bitfinex (all locked in so I could retire). Killed the short and bought bitcoins so I could transfer it to a US exchange at just over $19k. Good news is I got everything off of Bitfinex...they seemed to be scrutinizing my withdrawal of bitcoins with e-mails about my US residency (I'm not a US resident) and such. It would seem that an exchange that was completely solvent wouldn't care about someone withdrawing a large amount of bitcoins. They would just process it like all the rest, it's not like my comparatively small amount of bitcoins should affect them. I think the caveat is that it has to be in a hot wallet, or am I mistaken?I think a lot of people are thinking the same thing and a huge p2p LN will pop up made up of such individuals. Is that Rootstock or something new?
My friends be like: It looks like this will push the price over 20k.I don't see any reason why we won't blow through the 20s fairly quickly. This just in?We've known the US is arming ISIS for years now. If bitcoins are being used to fund ISIS I might as well just sell it all and give all of the money to the US government. I hope I can get more at the rate of .21 like last time...time to pull out another 21 bcash I think this is Ver's motivation all along for bcash.If you look into the code closely you can see:#finally I have my revenge! ahhahahaha!!!10 goto transaction id: 5jsdf8sdu0a8ew0asd8fasduf0s8dfasvhjdhfaoisdufa98;20 reverse transaction;30 print "here are your 4.53231 bitcoins you were scammed out of Roger";yes, bcash is now written in Basic... Here's what I see happening with these ICOs. The SEC will start hitting a lot of them hard.Recent statements have basically said that the SEC sees ICOs as securities if it fits the criteria of a security, which most of them do (you merely need to mention that the tokens purchased will go up in value and they will consider it a security). They already hit one company that had to give back all of the money they raised.Almost every ICO incentivizes people to promote their token in compensation for tokens which is also illegal, they will start going after those people.If the company is not a US based company they can only sell to accredited investors. If they are in the US they have to register with the SEC and can only raise $50 million per year under Regulation A. Otherwise you can't have any US investors.ICOs are ETH's "killer app". It will go down in flames.Plus Rootstock released their smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain and are testing on the mainnet. No more need for ETHs for smart contracts, especially if you want your smart contract to have the ability to exchange directly for bitcoins. If Tezos survives the SEC they will have a better version of smart contracts coming out in early 2018. That reminds me of an ICO for a company that I read about that was following the rule of law in the strictest fashion. I was only able to read the "white paper" under NDA, it was restricted to investors in only a few provinces in Canada. They would sell their tokens but keep the private keys of all tokenholders to protect them. Their contingency for if they were hacked was to just duplicate the chain and re-issue everyone new tokens. How would they know who to issue them to? They would gather all of your information when you buy the token and you could not sell your token except through their exchange where they have the names of the people you sell to.It hurt reading through the white paper. It was shown to me by a lawyer asking if that was something we should do for Blue Frontiers as they were satisfied that it covered all of the bases as far as legality went. I went off on every bit of it but basically summed it up saying that if we wanted to do that...just create a central database and call them shares and be done with it. I learned long ago that posts on this thread have no influence on price since the big money moved in. We are all small fish, even though some are bigger small fish. Got a call this morning from the CEO of the company I retired from. He's an old friend so I told him to give me a call if he had any questions about Bitcoin.Over and over he kept asking me what the next Bitcoin would be. I would steer him back to buying bitcoin even just for the simple fact of using it as a door into the crypto world which he then asked again, so once I'm in the space...are there any coins you've been looking at...I pretty much told him that it was like trying to find the next Facebook. To look at the amount of development brainpower going into Bitcoin as opposed to any new coin with a dozen or so people. I told him that I have invested in some alt coins but I only invest in coins that I believe in for one reason or another, that I want to see them do well. Like with most people I just told him to go to Coinbase and buy a couple hundred dollars worth to learn the process and how to store your bitcoins, avoid Ethereum and Bitcoin cash because they're going to crash soon, and go from there. It's looking like this bubble might pop soon. I did this, it is fun:1. Download the 'eclaire wallet testnet' on your phone.2. Swipe left, get your receive address (2NEQJkk....)3. Go to: https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/faucet 4. Enter your receive address (or scan the QR code)5. Swipe app right (twice), click the +6. Click Autoconnect7. Put 5 or so mBTC in the "Channel capacity"8. Wait about 20 minutes (you might need to repeat steps 7,8)9. Once your Lightning Channel says "NORMAL", swipe left.10. Go here: https://starblocks.acinq.co and order a coffee.11. Check out and click the "Scan a payment" with your app.12. Pay. I seriously thought that 15% dip after 1000% gain this year was the end of cryptography.I burned all of my private keys, opened up my server to telnet instead of ssh, stopped using a website if it was https instead of http and moved to a wooden house in middle of nowhere.  Yep, I'm glad it didn't follow the short term upward trend it was on...it would have needed to double in 4 days to continue. Then the crash would have been yuuugge.Staying over $10k will keep the medium term upward trend going. things are quiet... The only reason nation states would want to manipulate the bitcoin price is because they have a lot of bitcoins.Like how they manipulate gold prices. It looks like last night we went through the full bubble cycle in like 6 hours, including return to the mean (on GDAX). So...some of us remember the early days when someone with a good chunk of money, like $10-50k could come in and move the market around and we saw a lot of volatility and watched as the walls moved things up and down (hence a thread to watch those walls).The response to such volatility was that as the market grew such small amounts wouldn't be able to manipulate the market and things would stabilize. But now we have financial firms and big time investment companies coming in doing the things that the small whales did in the early days.The same response to the volatility holds true, eventually the market cap will be so big that even those big firms can't move the price very much.Then come full nation states trying to move the price. You have a bitcoin car?
Is GBTC, Bitcoin Gold?Please say yes. Here is a bitcoin price calculator that lets you plug in your own numbers and see what the price should be.http://worldbitcoinnetwork.com/BitcoinPriceModel-Alpha.htmlIt was created years ago and is just an alpha version. I spoke to a tax accountant that specializes in expat and bitcoins. She quoted me a $50k fee to do my taxes going back a few years to ensure full compliance. Half of the fee was for "research". I didn't feel like I needed to pay $25k to have my accountant do some google searches.As with most things, it will be better to do things on my own. I just need to gather up all of the things I spent bitcoins on in the past few years and calculate things out. Might be tedious work but best to get it over with. Pay ISIS some money (through the US govt) and move on to doing things smarter next year. My gf does localbitcoins in Thailand. The price is higher in India for some reason. She gets people from India who come here, take out baht from the ATM, buy bitcoins from her and immediately sell it on the Indian exchange to get rupees, which they can then withdraw again from the ATM. The limiting factor one guy says is the daily withdraw rate on his ATM.But this is shortlived...over the past week the baht price has gone above the US rate and is evening out with India. Good to see Proudhon back with his old zany antics. I agree!!11,111!! The bitcoin price is a great lead indicator for google search analytics.Now that you know...go forth and make millions. Yep. Found it.Great insight on this guy. Didn't Professor Bitcorn predict bitcoin price would be $10k?  What happened? Down $800 in 5 minutes.   If this happened last year we would all be broke.Next year when it drops $10k in 5 minutes will it feel the same? As someone who was involved with Bitcoin when this post came up I will say that I have joined the wealthy elite (whatever that means, I believe I have achieved it). This week is my first week of retirement and I will be moving to Tahiti for bigger and better things.Congratulations to others that have stuck around for so long and ensuring that the bankers will have some competition in the land of the wealthy elite.This is gentlemen! Earlier this summer I said "if it keeps going up $100 per week I will be quite pleased"  I did last week but I think I've been out of the work force too long.  Looks like I need to go back to work. Anyone hiring?  Just a few people living on houseboats. Nothing to concern yourself with. Like I said, a small amount of people. But communes exist today. Are you going to go tell them that they don't work? It works if everyone agrees to it.Communes for example. Early Christianity was communist.
Pirates and waves. Most people that hear about it first usually bring up the waves too. 100 foot waves. And hurricanes. I think just about any government system will work with a small amount of people that are there voluntarily and know what they're getting into. The key being the ease of leaving if you don't like it. Your preconceived notions of something in such a primitive stage is lovely. Takes me to the way way back machine of the early days of Bitcoin.And like Bitcoin, seasteading will be started by libertarians and taken over by the same people that want it regulated and watered down. Definitely not for you. It is a prototype. The people actually making any decisions about its purpose will not be on Internet websites. They will be living on the seastead working to make it into something bigger. So now you're being forced by your own body? You're not obliged to anyone. Nobody is obliged to you.You can voluntarily cooperate. Most people do not like voluntary interactions. Especially if they have nothing to offer other than calling for force. Abiding by their criminal code with some limited economic freedom and sovereignty. Are you as concerned about the hundreds of thousands of miles of ocean front property that aren't cheap? Or just a tiny little floating island that will have no impact upon anyone else? Would you use force to allow poor people to live in ocean front properties? The initial seastead prototype will be in a Tahitian lagoon in a Special Economic Zone under French Polynesian criminal code. Freedom to do either depending upon the voluntary agreement between whoever owns those places you want to sleep. No force. That would require changing people. People have repeatedly demonstrated that they dislike freedom. Or at least it is a very low priority.Why try to fight to give people something they do not want? Live and let live. I have nothing against someone else not wanting freedom if I am able to go find it myself. I was prepared for this getting into seasteading but working with the large group of people that are working on this I have found this to not be the case. If anything it's leaning a bit too much in the environmentalist arena for my tastes. But I understand the need for leaning on the environmentalist side with ocean projects. I have discovered there is a certain environmentalist mafia that exists that you do not go up against. That is the old idealistic image for a Phase 3 seastead in middle of the ocean.The initial seastead that will actually be built will look more like this:My last day of work was Friday, I am officially "retired" (from working for a salary). I will be in Tahiti next month and plan on moving there in early 2018 to help get the seastead project off the ground. Theymos, glad you brought this up because this is exactly what is being worked on and has been in the works for the past year.In January of this year The Seasteading Institute was able to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the government of French Polynesia to build the world's first seastead in a protected lagoon of the main island of Tahiti granting a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) which would allow for some leeway on most economic laws while still being under the criminal code of French Polynesia. The Seasteading Institute, being a non-profit, split off a for profit company called Blue Frontiers ( http://www.blue-frontiers.com ).Blue Frontiers has been working on this full speed ahead, I started volunteering with them in June and they have been laying the ground work for an ICO since then ( https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/token/ ). The plan and what is currently going through the legal process is a Security token which would give each token holder shares of the Blue Frontiers company. We explored every other way of doing an ICO and it appears that following the letter of the law with the SEC is the best approach.The ICO should go live around the same time the French Polynesia legislation goes through in Q1 2018.Here is an updated image of the actual pilot seastead that will be produced, we have a firm from the Netherlands that has built floating structures before and a team of over 50 people working on every aspect of the seastead from food systems to energy, Internet, blockchain governance, etc. https://www.facebook.com/Blue-Frontiers-255004088265639/ We're not wealthy elite until the price is $10k gentlement. Every alt coin I bought because I liked what it did. But yes, I never did anything with any of them. I bought NMC because I liked the idea of a decentralized DNS and had planned on doing some development around it considering it allows more bytes per transaction than Bitcoin but never got around to it and now I can't access them on btc-e.I bought LTC because I think POS has some merit. Bought Maidsafe because I would like to be able to have decentralized Internet storage/bandwidth sharing. I just recently bought ZenCash because I met one of the guys in charge and he's pretty smart and doesn't approach it as trying to take over Bitcoin.I could have bought into ETH early on but went to a crypto conference hoping to hear the latest and greatest Bitcoin advances only to see a bunch of ETH folks pumping their coin before it was released. They were supposed to utilize the Bitcoin network which got them support then they went off and created their own coin and everyone at the conference was talking about how ETH would take over Bitcoin and how much Bitcoin sucked.I bought Tezos because I hope they replace ETH. I hope Rootstock replaces ETH.  Bitcoin is quickly losing.Source:https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituary-generator/ I cashed out 400 bitcoins to put toward a downpayment on my house. Back in 2012. When the price was $12. I figured BCash would have a big push over the holiday weekend. Already had one order go through at .21, I have time this weekend...I think it is time to dump all the rest...pump that shitcoin!
Bitcoin does not survive without greed. It is built in. The point made was that by getting bitcoins out early to people that could develop it into something better was so that those developers were incentivized to make Bitcoin into something great based on greed, the fact that they held a bunch of bitcoins and their value increased based upon how much effort they put into making it better.Having a depreciating currency also taps into peoples' greed of having more value down the road by keeping more bitcoins which perpetuates the rising value by making it more scarce.If you think it is greedy to cash out, it's a non-factor since you're transferring value for equal value which is not greedy.Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. I predicted in 2013 that the price would be $10k by the end of 2016.Boy was I way off. Not sure why but seeing the price over $8k I remember back to the time I shorted bitcoin at $2.50. It will be so that any alt coin that wants to compete will need to implement their own version of Lightning Network.  I set my BCH to BTC buy order at .21 BCH/BTC for 21 BCH. Hope they trigger it. Likely due to this:https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7dfwoj/the_first_ever_lightning_crosschain_swap_from/ I hope no politician can buy bitcoins. So when their currency collapses they die cold and hungry on the streets.Too much? Ya, I've been trying for a few months to get my btc-e wex.nz account back. They have a handy verification page when you try to log in so I was going through all of the steps, name, no problem, citizenship...*searches for United States* *checks for any way to input United States*, nope. I live in Korea so I put South Korea since it's an option. I input my Korean address, my Korean ID, my Korean utility statement.*denied* 'please include a scan of your passport'hmm...you're not going to like this buy my passport shows I am a United States citizen...which I cannot choose as an option.If Namecoin ever goes to the moon I'll have to get a second passport just to get my NMC from Wex. I had 21k NMC before they went down. They have every incentive to not let me back in. BCH was dead until Segwit2X died...now it's a thing again.Until January when Coinbase releases peoples' BCH to the millions of users that like free money. http://bitcoin11x.org  It's more profitable to just sell your BCH for bitcoins than to worry about their forked chain. So...just got an estimate from my accountant for my taxes (going back 2 years to clear up any past transactions I made as well as figuring out how to declare stuff on Bitfinex (shorts, margin lending, BCH, expat stuff, etc.). Initial estimate came to about $50k.That's a lot higher than the $150 I usually pay for TurboTax.Anyone have a decent accountant that understands Bitcoin? Strangely enough she owns bitcoin and accepts bitcoin but needed 60 hours for "Legal Research, Analysis, Opinion various BTC Issues" at over $400/hour. I've very motivated to sell off the rest of my BCH now...even with the hassle I have to go through with my cold storage. Glad I checked this before finalizing my transaction with that Saudi prince. Thank you! Looks like Roach was right guys. Should I buy 100 pounds of gold to carry around with me as I travel the world instead of bitcoins? My fork coins are worth what my bitcoins were worth last year.  We laugh and laugh and laugh...because Bitcoin is one thing they cannot stop with their precious governments. I think Lightning Network Coin will win out.
As long as Bitcoin finally reaches the adoption rate where we can all stop paying taxes, then the true reason for Bitcoin will be fulfilled. How often does one open and close a credit card in their lifetime? Makes perfect sense...Ver and most of the BCH crowd are big ETH supporters.BCH was poised to be the solution to Bitcoin's woes if the S2X fork completely hosed both systems and brought everything crumbling down.So people started buying BCH with their ETH.Now that the S2X fork isn't happening people are moving their money back into ETH. You had me until "has inflation"Federal Reserve Notes? You send them bitcoins, they give you "Bitconnect coins" which you can then "loan out" and get "interest".Basically, you send your bitcoins and get fake coins in interest payments. Just now the gf sold some bitcoins to a guy via localbitcoins in Bangkok...his reason for buying....he needs it for Bitconnect. Yep...there's her bf up there on stage.  Oh shit...my gf lives in Thailand and has started bring up Bitcoin on Facebook. One of her friends told her that her boyfriend travels giving conferences about Bitcoin and she showed me a picture of one of the conference rooms, it was a Bitconnect conference. I quickly googled it and saw that it was a scam and told my gf. She told her friend and she said the guy was one of the main guys in Bitconnect. When I was a valet I was driving someone's corvette out of the parking garage. The dumbass in front of me had to back up for some reason, the parking gate was right behind me and I had to back up so the gate was just above the trunk. People were honking, pointing at me and I'm like...I fit.When I got the car to the lady and stepped out she started freaking out. "What did you do to my antenna!?!".oops Hi Missy, I mean mom. The only point of having a Lambo is part of the "peacocking" process where you are displaying your prowess (wealth) to the opposite sex and to others in the hopes of achieving higher social standing and thus being able to obtain a better mate and ensure the survival and prosperity of your offspring.Totally legit human desire.Not all that necessary though. When I had my Porsche I found it quite futile when trying to pick up women. I'd be in the bar, my Porsche sitting outside in the parking lot...no assistance to my game. Now I drive a 2005 Hyundai but have the hottest girlfriend I've ever had.  Spending bitcoins just makes it so that converting my salary to bitcoins is no big deal.If I were buying something on Amazon with fiat, I could have just as easily bought bitcoins with that fiat.But by spending bitcoins I get a 15% discount. Plus all of that time between getting paid and spending my bitcoins my currency has gained value instead of lost value. Purse.io only works in a few EU countries. I think maybe France and GB. I know of a different method for Germany. I don't buy a lot of things on Amazon but whenever I go to my purse.io to buy something I have just about the same dollar balance that I had the last time I bought something.I like this magic Internet money. I read that interview the other day, very interesting. I am also deep in the weeds in the securities world now and see that more companies are looking to put their securities on a blockchain. It should be an interesting dynamic. One company that has been doing securities for years is now opening things up to crypto securities on the blockchain. Though just about all of them are using Ethereum. I keep raising my hand when it comes to which blockchain to use mentioning Bitcoin but all of the smart contract developers are in the ETH world. Hopefully this all changes after Rootstock opens up later this month.Overstock's T0 should be interesting as well, it's been a long time coming.As for account sales...someone offered me what would have been the equivalent of $2 per post for their signature campaign. Would be attractive to someone in a 2nd or 3rd world.Interestingly enough...I nobody see anyone's signatures...is this happening? Is bitcointalk going to make a comeback?nvm...looks like just this thread But we are. Ending the Fed has been the goal from the beginning. I have been paid 100% in bitcoin. Dealing with taxes is the same as being paid in fiat.Funny you should mention Bitcoin as a reserve currency. While brainstorming a new floating island currency we were confronted by the hard truth that the currency would have too much volatility. One solution was to peg our currency's value to bitcoin. From our research we found that pegging the value to something like gold would cost a lot of money in holding a certain amount of gold, having it audited, ensuring that it was secure, etc. While using bitcoin as a reserve currency you can transparently show that it is backed, auditing is simplified and securing is easier than for gold. Bitcoin's price trend over time has shown less volatility, as it becomes less volatile than over a dozen national currencies. It is not a huge stretch to predict that bitcoin price could be one of the more stable currencies in the world and perhaps it could become a major reserve currency due to the ease of doing so. I hope to become very involved in life extension. Hopefully it will play a big role on the seastead, many seasteaders I've met so far support it. Yep. Fortunately I had a lot of equity. I just saw that the house I sold last year for $260k is now on the market for $325k.     That guy sure did invest wisely. All I got out of it was a couple hundred BTC at $650 each.
This all assumes that you get paid in fiat and convert some to bitcoin.If you can get paid 100% in bitcoin and live 100% off of bitcoin, why would you choose to ever use fiat as per Gresham's law?Even a poor person being paid in bitcoin and spending only bitcoin will be better off for it.Once you hit that, you can only "hoard" it up to a point. You still have to spend money to survive.If everyone used 100% Bitcoin then the only deflationary pressure would be population growth which is hardly hyperdeflationary. https://www.yunessun.com/en/coffee bath, wine bath.. Coffee Bath 43 thisif there is anything I have learned from TV, this is definitely the best use of one's money I had the same thing happen to me when we jumped up to $1200. Puts a whole new perspective on life. Even now.You go through your whole life with the idea that you have to work to make money, you need to upgrade your skills so you can get further in your career, you plan on working the rest of your life.Then this happens and that is all thrown out the window. At the very least you can stop working at a job you don't like and start doing things you do like.For me I want to work on something else and I keep falling into the old way of thinking of looking at how profitable it will be. Obviously if I'm working I want to get compensated but it is not as important. But if I work at some fun job that only pays me $10-$20 per day there's really no reason to make money, may as well do voluntary work.I have been considering doing some blockchain work like Satoshi and not going the ICO route to make big bucks...just create something that will help the world and set it out there to grow on its own. Haven't lost faith in BTC, just wanted to lock in my retirement and not have to worry about money for the rest of my life. I locked in about half of my BTC stash which means I am only half as excited by the price rise as I was before.Being an expat I do not pay taxes on the first $100k of income. I jumped the gun earlier this year and cashed out more than the $418k 20% capital gains threshold so a CRT might be able to get me back under that to get that down to 15%. Considering I don't have to pay the charity until I'm dead I hope to outlive the US and not worry about it. Either way money saved now vs money years from now that is worth enough to buy a loaf of bread is always better. I remember back when the price was over $7k.Under $7k now... What now? War bonds? Have any US citizens looked into a Charitable Remainder Trust for their BTC? I'm talking to a lawyer next week about setting one up. Seems like the best way to convert capital gains into income. Which, for me living overseas, I would rather have income which is not taxed than gains that are taxed.   1 seastead platform I was wondering about that. I had a tiny amount shorted and I figured the BTG -.01 BTG thing was an error. I had about 5 BTC on the exchange so I went to move it to the trading wallet to get rid of my BTG but accidentally put it in margin and it subtracted that tiny amount. I immediately moved that to the trading side and turned it into .1 BTC or so.These fork alts are like DOGE...the best thing to do with them is get rid of them as soon as you get them. Exchanges are probably given a percentage of the coins to put on their exchange along with the founders adding some coins for liquidity.This gives it a price as people trade them for bitcoins slowly eating them up. So...if the price ever starts going down too much I will create a new fork...announce a few months ahead of time while buying...then short right before the fork. Then fork it and let that die.Perhaps we can get someone to do this once every couple of months if we go through another slow period. I Agree!  One of those "I'm going to try to spend bitcoins in the real world" videoshttp://www.businessinsider.com/trying-to-pay-for-things-with-bitcoin-price-gold-2017-10but with a twist I have several people asking me about Bitcoin, especially knowing I am retiring because of it. One guy at work who obviously hates his job sees it as a way for him to retire too so he asks how to get into it, then sighs when he realizes that he would have to wait. Sort of depressing every time I talk to him. They just want to get rich quick, I know he doesn't care about Bitcoin and I would rather not help but I will for the sake of being cordial.Most people that are overseas I remind them that Bitcoin is a cheaper way of dealing with money than the way they are currently getting their money (going to the ATM to get dollars, taking those dollars to the overpriced exchange to change it to Won). I also ask them if they ever buy anything on Amazon, and tell them that they can save 15% on all of their Amazon purchases with Bitcoin (everyone out here buys a lot on Amazon, one guy had over $60k spending history in the past few years). I try not to encourage the "get rich quick" folks even though that's most people. After the early phase of "we need Bitcoin regulations" (so the price will go up) people seeping into the community I know better than telling just anyone about it.Though when they ask me when is the right time to buy I say any time is the right time to buy. I tell them about an order I had in when the price was $230...I got greedy and put my buy order in at $225...it never reached that price again and I had to eventually jump in at $600 to get my money off of the exchange. Yes, because when everything is blockchain based, only the rich benefit.Better get rid of your bitcoin now because it's just something for rich people to not pay taxes. Only the rich can use a currency that the government doesn't distribute. It already costs over $5k, only a rich person can afford that.I guess I should tell the many socialists working on this that their expectations of helping the environment and having self sustaining design, closed loop food systems, renewable energy, recycling systems, a solution for refugees, coral development, etc. is just going to benefit the rich.A seastead will be a tiny speck on an ocean that is twice the size of all the countries in the world combined. Yet people will still be pissed off if there are rich people out in middle of nowhere being free rich. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. I will defer the conversation back to communism vs fascism vs capitalism (because those are the only systems that can ever exist).The idea of testing new systems on a micro scale is insane and invites crazy rich people with swords and swashbuckling (because...movies and books).Best to do that all at the scale of trillion dollar economies with population destroying weaponry.
Yes, the movies for both have shown many battles.But when the discussion of us going to Mars has come up, I have yet to see someone say  "aren't you worried about space pirates?". I find it strange that when the mention of a floating structure in the huge ocean comes up, pirates are the immediate thought in everyone's mind yet when someone talks about going into space...no talk of space pirates. I suppose only in space people are civil. Go out on the ocean...we revert to the 1600s. You are fooling yourself if you don't believe that might makes right in the current system.The example given when it comes to war for seasteads is that the night a seastead decides to go to war, they would come out in the morning only to find that half of their population is gone.You have some mystical idea of seasteads as if things like the UN and powerful nations do not exist in this world. Trust me, if a seastead is involved in piracy or child abductions or anything too outside of the tastes of powerful nations, they will cease to exist. Somalia was once without a government and they were immediately attacked and invaded by the UN and the US (might makes right). Future seasteads (in the open ocean) would likely be small communities. No need to own your own seastead (do you own your own housing association/trailer park/apartment complex/town?). Seasteads will likely be groupings of floating homes or platforms providing housing, each with their own sets of rules and expectations. From the looks of the work we are doing on the first seasteads almost everything will be blockchain based. Pick the seastead that most closely fits your ideals of how a community should be run, and move there. If they stray, move to another seastead. If some new concept pops up that sounds better than what you have, move there. Either by selling your home or floating your new home depending on how things are set up. From the first peeks at the numbers I can say that the housing costs will not be too different from ocean front property, some less some more. As things scale that price will certainly come down. Your bot screwed up and revealed your 2 accounts.  If you have not yet seen this, watch it. If you have, watch it again.Bitcoin vs. Political Power: The Cryptocurrency Revolution - Stefan Molyneux at TNW Conferencehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joITmEr4SjYThis is why Bitcoin has to succeed.Stop worrying about the price and work on helping Bitcoin to succeed.  Won't somebody please think of the transnational corporations?!?

I gave my 2 month notice this week. I can leave any time but I like the people at my company and wanted to give them plenty of time to find a replacement when I leave.I don't do shit at work any more. Today I responded to an e-mail and looked at a problem on one of the systems. That's all I did this week.Feels good to not care about getting fired. Response to me from Bitfinex:So if you are a US resident you can always just register as a business and use that for your account.Not being a resident I'm good. I still plan on moving most of my funds off (I'd plan on doing it anyway) but will still leave some income producing margin funding. Laws lead to corruption.Corruption leads to chaos.Chaos leads tosuffering. Ya, Bitfinex was my go-to exchange due to being able to margin fund. I've made over $25k just in interest off of a small portion of money I cashed out this summer (though had I kept it in BTC it would be a lot more). I was hoping that income would be what I would live off of when I retire...the returns via margin funding averaged around 20-30% APY.The wording is U.S. individual customers. I wonder if it means U.S. residents or U.S. citizens. I know the SEC sees the two differently which is likely their main concern.I already cashed out on that platform but I'd have to convert to BTC then convert back to USD on a US exchange, I hope the IRS doesn't treat that as capital gains twice. I'd keep it in BTC but the deed is done and I'll be paying my extortion money to the war lords anyway so I may as well have it in something that I can make some safe investments.I suspect though that many US customers will need to cash out their USD to BTC to get it off platform as well...could push the price up quite a bit.It's a shame, at my current funding rate I'm getting a 115% yearly interest (due to the price jump). Try to get any returns like that on any other investment (outside of the crypto-world  ). "This video contains content from UMG, who has blocked it in your country on copyright grounds." This. They will slowly push the price up over $100k/BTC. Then BAM! drop the price down to below $10k.  Down $200 today, has the Bitcoin experiment failed?Time to go buy some JP Morgans. Hodler designed controversial currency. Oh no...not 100%. Maybe half. I have mixed feelings about the rise. I locked in my retirement at a lower price. So now I'm not "as rich" as I could be. Best to stop thinking about the "what ifs" and just be happy. Strange feeling though. itBit is also good if you want to trade large amounts ($5k+)
It was a zero feedback person. Almost everyone that bought from me in Germany had no feedback because Germany did all of us sellers a favor and banned localbitcoins from Germany. All that did was locked in all of our ads which gave me a monopoly listing (2 listings, one making 10% and one making 15%) in my area and people could only connect to the site via VPN. 100% of my sales were with people buying on localbitcoins for the first time, I enjoyed helping to introduce Germans to Bitcoin and usually gave them some advice on how to take care of their BTC and some good places to spend them. I had done 15k transactions before so this was not too big of a stretch.I was actually not going to go to that final sale but it was my 100% rating with over 100 transactions that I didn't want to screw up in case I wanted to sell again in another place. Well, it wasn't so much a hack as it was the old school way of a professional pick pocket and a crime syndicate targeting me with a team of people. I too was about to shut down my localbtc account due to some shady people starting to show up (up until then it had been just typical German dudes that wanted to get into Bitcoin).They sent a couple of young guys first to feel me out. I would meet at the local McDonalds and sell coins there in a location directly across from a police station where I parked my car. Then the big boss and his lackey showed up a few weeks later asking for big money. We did a quick 5k euro trade that went fine and he asked if I could do 50k euro. I told him that was too much but could do lower. Eventually I decided I was going to shut down my localbtc account and I would just sell 30k/85BTC (enough to live on for the 2 more years I planned on living in Germany) worth to him.He sent his lackey, there was a shady dude standing outside of McDonalds when I went in (didn't pay much attention to it then), as we were doing our trade I verified the currency wasn't fake, I transferred the BTC and put the money in my pocket ready to walk out to my car. I shook the guy's hand and as I went to walk toward the door he stood up to put his coat on asking me to hold his bag while he put it on. I obliged taking my hand out of my pocket while I did so, at that moment another guy came up behind me and switched the envelope of euros from my pocket with an envelope of counterfeit euros. Immediately after handing the bag back to the guy I put my hand back in my pocket and walked out confident that I was holding the money. It wasn't until I got home that I noticed that the money was fake. I went back to the McDonalds to see their video footage, they just had a grainy picture that couldn't identify the guys but showed the guy reaching into my pocket. I knew the police couldn't/wouldn't do anything about it, I tried calling a private investigator but they just told me to call the police. I didn't feel like turning my life into being a victim and constantly worrying about getting it back. I cut my losses and moved on. I warned the folks on localbitcoins and some dude later caught one of the team. Tackled him as they all scattered after he caught him trying to rob him.My reward for that whole ordeal was the German polizei showing up at my door at 5AM with a search warrant a few weeks later as well as them calling my employer (the US military) to tell them about it. They were likely monitoring the localbitcoins forum. Selling bitcoins is perfectly legal by private parties in Germany, I made sure to check that out before ever selling any. I hope the folks over at Divine read your in-depth research before going through the trouble. Yes, because the one sentence I typed saying "some sort of" covered the entirety of it including how to discourage abuse.  Someone stole 85 bitcoins from me, I let the localbitcoins community know what/who to watch out for. The only response the police gave me was seizing all of my computers/cell phones/money and investigating me for money laundering.After over a year they finally returned everything to me (everything useless because I already had to replace everything plus who knows what they added to all of my devices).My thought on preventing such a thing from happening is some sort of "reputation coin" where everyone has a reputation that can be looked up and anyone who has dealt with that person can report on them (like yelp/ebay). Anyone who is a fraud or violent will be punished by society due to nobody wanting to deal with them and taking precautions when they're around. I believe in it in the same way I believe in air.I use bitcoin all the time for real world purposes. There is nothing to not believe. So I gave my nieces and nephews some bitcoins a few years ago and they have the addresses.But it looks like they'll miss out on the Bcash giveaway. Should I chance withdrawing their Bcash and add the funds to their current address or not risk it?  Just use the Brave browser. That is all built in to the browser. It could centralize if everyone uses one service. LN will be centralized in the same way that MtGox was the only Bitcoin exchange for several years. And then it wasn't. All governments extort their citizens.Well, all governments with income taxes. If you paid with dollars then that would be 25% less dollars you would have to buy bitcoins.You also perpetuate that bitcoin is only used for buying pot. Trust me, when most of your wealth is tied up in bitcoins, you will spend them.The flaw is thinking that people that get it will be holding very much fiat to spend. Maybe enough for a restaurant or groceries for the week but the big things like travel, large purchases, etc. are done with bitcoins. I have seen it before but there was some news this week about inter-blockchain transactions without a central exchange. What was that called? I'd like to dive into how that works. Gold and silver is money for people that want this world to be like Dungeons and Dragons. Stability has always fueled the Bitcoin rocket. That makes sense. They have value due to some external definition not by having value itself.Either way, this is likely not the road we would take but it needs to be checked off the list. The SEC sucks balls. Just looking at creating a colored coin that would represent equity shares in a company. One way to comply with SEC regulations is if shares of a company can only be sold after 1 year. And any sale of that share beyond that also needs to be held a year. We are looking at all SEC options which all have varying degrees of limitations in place. I was just vetting whether or not the 1 year delay route was possible via Bitcoin. It might be possible with ETH but I'll let our ETH guys look into that. I know that you can already set a lock time which allows you to set the future block for which a transaction has to wait until to be confirmed, but would there be a way to specify locking any transaction after that by a set amount of blocks?Like I send 2 bitcoins to address 1XYZ which is locked for 1 month (a certain amount of blocks). Then once 1XYZ has access to the funds they send to two different addresses, 1ZYX and 1WXY but they both have the same delay of 1 month. And those transactions also have a delay and so on and so on...I ask this as I am trying to figure out a programatic way of conforming to some certain SEC regulations for something. We are still flushing some things out but I just want to know if this path is possible. True. But I don't see moving from country to country as bringing bitcoins with you. Bitcoins are just an account. It would be like bringing your bank account password across the border. Seems legit.Personally I think we will move toward that $2500 in the next 6 months or so (maybe dipping below that due to paranoia/FUD) but work its way up toward those new huge numbers. The price did dip below $200/BTC but it was brief. I usually don't tell my friends to buy bitcoins but when the price was $225 I got on Facebook and said "buy now, trust me". I think maybe 1 or 2 people listened.Right now, even though I believe the price could go down over the course of the next year I just tell people that ask me...do you want to double your money by 2020? If so, buy bitcoins. But don't just buy to double your money, learn how to use it and spend it, save money on Amazon, don't pay exchange fees when you travel to another country, etc.
I travel a lot and move to different countries at times with all of my belongings (a carry-on and backpack).I chose to use cryptosteel as my cold storage. I have several of them to split my coins up. Before moving to a new country the last time I went country hopping for a vacation before going to my new job. There was no way I was going to check in my cryptosteel and I was worried about anyone tampering with my cryptosteel so I wrapped them all into one block with a metallic tape.Of course this set off the security scan as I went through Dubai. I spent about 10 minutes with the security guard trying to show him that they were harmless plates of metal (finally unwrapping one of them). It didn't help that I have a full chemical suit with gas mask but that's another story.When I passed through Vietnam I made sure to have a picture of the cryptosteel on my phone and told the guy it was for my bitcoins. He just said "oh, bitcoins! cool" and let me go. I checked my bag when I passed through Thailand and was paranoid the whole time. I have a backup (somewhere in the world) and I have manipulated the private keys in such a way that even if someone was looking at them they would not have my private keys. But I still did not want to lose it. Relying on my backups would mean a lot of flights long flights. I can always tell which way those with "a lot of trading experience" believe the price of bitcoin will go.They have all of that experience, they are so great with the market that they failed to see the potential value of Bitcoin and how it would jump to thousands of dollars each.Even now they don't get it and all of their "experience" still tells them it is worthless, so obviously the price will go to zero. So they can get back to their stocks and bonds. Even retired living on a catamaran in Tahiti I would check in on this thread. I find that between all of the arguments and general banter there is a good sense of what is going on in the Bitcoin world here from many different perspectives. Especially with regard to large price movements. It may not be the most accurate but it beats searching the Internet trying to see if people are reacting to one single thing or what is going on.The rest of the forum is shit due to signature campaigns. Reddit is comparable as the shitty threads can be downvoted. I tried following #bitcoin on twitter and it's just filled with ads. Go check out one of the bitcoin exchanges that the US government doesn't like:https://btc-e.com When you forced into slavery by your government (worse, sent off to die) you tend to be sad.  I'll give you guys here a sneak peek into the future of seasteading because the people here understand the implications of it.Excellent video with some behind the curtain looks into what will be revealed in the next couple of months.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVAicGsF4DA Bitcoin has done that exact thing several times already.It's like a broken record with this thing. The only thing that matters is that the "mean" is upward moving over time. Something the dollar and fiat currencies do not do. They will blame the falling price on many short term things (China, Dimon, x, y or z). The simple truth is that a bunch of people saw the price skyrocketing and wanted to make a quick buck. Whether they did or not, people will not be rushing in to lose a quick buck if they see the price going down over the course of several weeks. So less cash coming in and those that just wanted some quick money will be jumping ship.It happened with the jump to $32, $266, $1200 and now $4970. The price was rising as it needed to...but the quick money folks exacerbated it a bit and pushed the price higher than it needed to go.It's all good. The correction is healthy. However you invested is fine. Just don't believe whatever they blame it on.And just look at the highs I mentioned...notice which direction those are going?As high as the price is and knowing there is likely going to be a correction, when my friends ask me if they should buy bitcoins I just say...it depends on if you want to at least double your money by 2020. People going from average amount of money to a millionaire are more likely to sell off a good chunk of their bitcoins when they become millionaires. No dude making $50k holding 10,000 bitcoins is going to just keep holding those bitcoins when the price hits $100. He'll sell a large amount. Even though today he would be a lot richer. He may keep some, but I think there will be a lot of wealthy early adopters but not so much a dozen or so super-wealthy early adopters like in the oil industry or computer industry. Ironically enough, we were looking into creating a cryptocurrency for our seastead and one proposed solution to the high volatility that would come with a new currency with no market was to use bitcoin as a reserve currency. I created my own MUD. The Four Lands. Strangely enough it's still running. Run by the person I handed it off to.ISCABBS for me   Yep, I use it mainly for spending. Throw a few hundred $ worth on there and throughout the week use it. Refill as needed. Like a regular wallet in your pocket. They are too...I was thinking phone apps. Electrum is probably best as far as security goes.I only include blockchain.info because of my frustration with breadwallet not allowing you to set your transaction fee. Though I don't use it personally. I used Mycelium but did not like it as a phone app. I agree with Schift on the problem, I don't entirely agree with him on the solution. Gold would need to be digitized in order to be useful in today's economy. The way I see it:Long term storage of value (10-50 years): goldModern long term storage of value (5-10 years): Bitcoin cold storage (cryptosteel, redundant backups, safe deposit box, etc)Medium term storage of value (<1-5 years): Bitcoin cold storage (paper wallet, trezor, etc.)Short to medium term storage of value/spending: hot wallet (breadwallet, blockchain.info for monthly spending, etc.)Sadly enough, less and less people agree with Schiff on the problem when that is the whole point of Bitcoin. You would be better off trying to trade a candy bar for goods or services.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1zF3ZCirhA Well...a few being 2  I sat through my $10k investment at $17 (right after the $32 bubble) went down to $2 over the course of 2 years. I sat through the $1200 bubble that came down over the course of 2 years to $180. There could certainly be some correlation between the halving and the price rise. Inflation gets cut in half and we have price discovery to find the new value. Overshooting only leads to a downward price pattern which in turn takes all of these new "get rich quick, FOMO" people that buy bitcoins just because they see dollar signs and makes them run away scared as the price is going down. And after a year of dropping price nobody wants to invest in something losing value ("It could go to 0!"). So it tends to drop below the value due to that type of speculation.I don't see as big of a drop this time as the last two times though since this "bubble" was rather weak. I think the price will mainly be down in the $2k range, maybe dip under $1k on some FUD briefly before starting a new climb to heights that nobody but McCafee would predict.You have to admit, zooming out to the 2 year chart the pattern looks all too familiar. In all honesty, even though I already put in my guess, I predict the next ATH will not be until 2020  I fear another 2 year bitcoin hibernation period before much more amazing prices. We have lived through that 4 year cycle a few times already, I have little doubt it won't happen again.I'm still holding though. But this time I will not have a job when it hits the 2 year low to buy all of those cheap coins. All of the responses have been in non-US standard. This seems like the lamest Bitcoin bubble yet.Are we still on our way to 'return to "normal"' or do we begin the 'fear' stage?If this is the end of the cycle then it was pretty tame and they are getting more and more tame each time. The 'return to mean' phase would put us solidly over $2k which is still fine by me. But it may dip just under $1k before turning around.Or we're following the short term TA charts and we'll bounce off of $3k or so.Two things that may play the biggest role are the Chinese closings and the possible ETFs this month. Nice to have the bear trolls back. It hasn't been the same without them. Not sure why they all left about 4 months ago...
Calling the 30 day low at $2940. Took you a while but you finally got around to your shitcoin investment. Hey guys, I'm an investor but I missed the biggest investment in the last decade so let me tell you why that investment is wrong....And also...blockchain is the next big thing! Don't miss out.some people are just hilarious Are you talking about the sheer amount of electricity it takes to secure dollars in banks and credit cards along with all of the offices, money trucks, printing presses, legislators, wars, etc?A lot wasted for people to use their Amex. Some are finally catching up and realizing that they can't create a centralized decentralized blockchain. So now they attack Bitcoin.Or haven't you reached that point yet? We don't plan on waiting. Oh, hello 2016. I remember the olden days when banks thought they could create their own blockchains to compete with Bitcoin but failed. So now they attack it again. Then there are us hodlers who are not interested in buying war debt. The game that brings out all of the random n00bs that just so happen to have the same sign up date.I'll just say December 31st, 2017 for some sort of tax reason that I do not know about. I dare say this will be the first weekend pump in a long time. I almost feel bad for the people selling now.Almost. Smaller governments are starting to catch on and realize that if they can create a blockchain friendly regulatory environment they can capitalize on the $100 billion industry. At some point the regulations on Bitcoin exchanges will make it increasingly difficult for people to get their hands on fiat for whatever reason they might have (momento? wallpaper?). Hilarious.Give that man an emmy. Best advice to give friends that want help with bitcoins is to have them send you the money to buy bitcoins directly from the source (wholesale, not that retail shit). Then e-mail them the public key with the amount of money they have in it. Tell them to hold at least 10 years and don't check that address too much because it overloads the system. About a $7 million sell wall on finex.But it's one of those fake walls trying to push the price down. Ya, I have a plane ticket to purchase. Not sure if the ticket price will go up more than the bitcoin price goes up over the next week. Sold it all at $3800. See you at $1/BTC suckers!!! For anyone new that is in Bitcoin to get a lot of dollars take this sound advice:When people are panicking...sell!I hear there is big money in bonds or a reverse mortgage (easy money!) If people are panic selling because of what some guy at JP Morgan said....GOOD.I hope they go long on the dollar and buy war bonds. Maybe run up some credit card debt and pay overdraft fees to their banks. Enjoy your inflationary (on purpose!) currency. A whole lot of n00bs leaving the Bitcoin market right now with their participation trophys.This is why when someone asks me if it's the right time to buy I ask them if they don't like war then this is the perfect time. If they like children being bombed then it's better for them to keep their war money.
Ok I get it. Last year all of the banks and governments were like...hmm, blockchain's not bad (quick, create a blockchain to compete with Bitcoin).This year their IT folks finally came back and told them...umm, blockchains are decentralized. You already have a centralized blockchain...it's called a database.And so...Bitcoin and blockchain are evil again. Yes, been looking at places like Zug Switzerland, Isle of Man, Mauritius and others for examples.Some of these smaller countries are hungry to bring the brainpower, tech and money that exists in the crypto market to their countries so they are willing to negotiate on pro-blockchain legislation. So it is definitely not impossible. And they wonder why our money flows to these investments that are not under the thumb of governments and banks.Oh ya, thanks for the warning government media. I'll get right on taking your advice. Does anyone know which exchange I can buy the bitcoin ICO? *music stops**stares at Cerbera* I know adding laws would not help but what would be the ideal regulations for a crypto-friendly nation? Like the most ideal nation that would encourage businesses to move there.One thing I can think of is not requiring any sort of certifications or licenses to run an exchange. Allowing bitcoins to be used for payment for government services. There's a way to do it in Germany. Let me know if that's the case. 15% off. So...theoretically, say you were going to a government with a list of legal changes that would make way for an ideal environment for cryptocurrencies and blockchains what would you propose?Things such as, no certification requirements for exchanging cryptocurrencies or foreign/domestic currencies... This was addressed years ago, early on in their deployment. I believe someone was questioned by the police about a package and the item was taken by the police. After that they created a guarantee on all purchases up to $10,000 and I assume have taken some measures to prevent this. I've used it for years and never had a problem. http://www.purse.io Nice. I used to get those rates. Now I settle for around 15%. Mainly because shipping to Korea takes about 2 weeks and people don't want to wait that long to get their bitcoins. I was going to grab some cash this weekend, Won, as I am getting low but decided against it Saturday morning when I saw the price.I knew that the low price was due to uncertainty about China even though the news article was just clickbait. It will be up quite a bit more by next weekend. The answer to your answer and everything is 42 hundred. Fairly decent system for proving bitcoin holdings. Once a month move of coins. I think a signed proof would work just as well. Ummm...yes.You go out and buy $4600 worth of goods...using bitcoin.Speaking of using bitcoin as a currency...Theoretically, what would you think about using bitcoin as a reserve currency for an alt coin which could eventually become the currency for a small nation?I was watching Andreas give a talk about the difficulties of using gold as a reserve due to people going to check the reserves and finding that there is no gold. With Bitcoin you can publicly verify the reserves.Also, over the years bitcoin's volatility is going down and will only decrease over time as the market cap grows. Currently being less volatile than 20 national currencies.What might be the best mechanism for ensuring such a reserve as far as people being able to trade their coin in for bitcoins at any time?Just brainstorming. Might need to spend the day getting the last of my B*CH over to bitcoins while they still have any value. Centralized ledgers are always a good idea.Everything is fine.Nothing to see here. Apparently a news article posted a click bait akin to Buzzfeed re-hashing the ICO ban from last week but saying it in a way that made it sound like China was shutting down Bitcoin exchanges. Ahh...China ban #34. They banned ICOs last week which stopped all ICOs. So there's a dip...what should we do?
1 satoshi/byte transactions are going through on Bitcoin.Last night I paid 4 satoshi/byte and my transaction went through in about an hour.  Thanks for the insight from the merchant's point of view.As someone who tends to spend bitcoins I have been to many shops and restaurants to spend bitcoins in person and I suspect they have similar results. Usually if it is just a waiter or waitress they will kind of know what you're talking about when you say you want to pay in bitcoins but are mainly hoping to go ask someone who knows. Several times I have had them come back and say their system is down (which typically means they had a tablet set up for it somewhere but nobody bothered to charge it, or they have no idea how to accept it if they got the tablet working). I have had to help a few people with their own system to show them how they are supposed to accept it.From all of my experience I created a prototype of a simple system where it's basically a cell phone stand with one side being the customer view and the other being the merchant view. You just put cheap cell phones (priced them out to $10 each on alibaba) in the stand and allow the merchant to type in the price and let the other phone receive the payment request and display the QR code and price. One USB chord for both to keep it running.Never did anything with it, I got a prototype of the stand from one chinese company but it was vertical as opposed to horizontal, and life made me too busy to write the software for the phones (bought a couple of cheap android phones to test with). Now it's just a hassle carrying the things around in my suitcase when I move. Also paid for a prototype of a wall mounted Bitcoin price ticker but again, life got in the way. Maybe when I retire next year I can pull these projects out of mothballs. This. Serfs were basically slaves with the 30% in taxes they had to pay on their wages. Just saw the headline of "BREAKING NEWS" but have not read the OP. Just wanted to post to make sure I'm not too late to ask, when is this supposed to happen? Today or this week? Throughout the summer any crash or increase has been mainly across the board with all cryptocurrencies.While last year there was some sort of inverse relationship between ETH and BTC, this year they are rising and falling together.I would conclude that cryptocurrencies as a whole are being invested in, not just one or two. Even if big investors were investing in BTC, that would then trigger people to buy ETH with their newly inflated BTC and so on and so on.Last year's inverse relationship had more to do with the FUD that ETH was going to replace BTC. That's why I am choosing Tahiti. I hope to be there helping them get things ramped up and become one of the first seasteaders. I will likely move to Tahiti next year and will likely live on a boat. Hey guys, I'm trying to load the charts for Bitfinex but I keep getting a 4404 error. They have it close.It will be floating sea-states.https://www.blue-frontiers.com/ I did let that sink in.Mind officially blown. Meanwhile...a fire sale on Bitcoin Crash. Guys this dip has me in quite the predicament. I got a scratch on my lambo and before I would have just bought a new one because why not right?Now I am deciding between having it sent back to the factory for a full body replacement or if the dip goes further I will have to have to resort to how the common folk fix this...full paint job.  So what's the new channel?Are we going to be bouncing between $4500 and $4800 or so? Expect the same when we hit $10,000. People are waiting to hit X number to "cash out" and become bitcoin poor. So ends bitcoin. Time to go buy war bonds. The article mentions an announcement on bitcointalk. Any idea where that thread is? That is a strategy on becoming rich. Not what defines what is rich. I think the distinguishing characterisric to denote being "rich" is the source of income. Most people get their wealth through income. The rich mainly derive it from their investments. The choice of what to invest in thus affects society more than someone pulling an income. It could be considered a like-kind exchange.Though...getting the additional coins in the first place...income? dividend? magic?
Don't invest more than you can afford to loose.Foot loose. nvm, just checked through their documentation and it said withdrawals could take 12 hours. I used to use Bitfinex as a wallet way back in the day. Guess that is not a thing anymore. Does anyone use Bitfinex much? I sold my B*CH there and tried to send a large bitcoin payment and it's not even showing up on the network yet.The Bitfinex message says it is "queued for processing".How long is that supposed to take? Glad I got in on the dip this week. I usually don't get to "buy the dip" as I don't have fiat but this time I had some bright and shiny free alt coin to buy the dip with. This is about go go up up up! So, has anyone in here consulted an accountant?I found one that understands cryptocurrencies but the quote he gave me was $500/hr with a $2k retainer. Seems a bit steep. Some people can rise above being animals and be intellectual individuals.I do not blame you, many people are weak and believe they need to be part of something "bigger than themselves" due to low self esteem. It is the rallying cry of those that cannot hack it in the world on their own. You are among the majority. I do not expect most people to have self confidence, but I don't have to listen to their justifications for covering up that fact either. I have my own life to live without wasting my time with those that have yet to come to terms with themselves. Time to ignore racists on here too. My culture? I am my own culture. I am responsible only for my actions. Any people in the past or future are not me. How does not being a racist affect my culture other than show that I am not intellectually weak and prone to manipulation due to my need to feel like I am part of some collective? Two year olds also poop their pants.Some people gain intelligence and become enlightened to the point that they realize that people are individuals with their own thoughts and ideals.  I tirelessly spend time blocking every racist news source on Facebook only to come to a Bitcoin forum to hear more discussion of race.Get over it. It is meant to divide you and you are falling for it.Now I will have to tirelessly ignore people on here to the point where it will be like the beartroll days where my wall will be filled with ignore posts. Looks like this is what is playing out.On a good note, this was good timing for when I sold some of my B*CH that took almost 24 hours to get to the exchange. Collectivism is an ugly thing. It is a lazy way of putting people into groups in order to deal with them as opposed to seeing them as individuals with their own thoughts and ideals. The continent will be there but what we currently call the United States as defined by the US Constitution will soon be bankrupt and sold off or taken over by some new regime.Considering the US debt is $20 trillion with over $100 trillion in unfunded laibilities. The interest on that debt is soon climbing from the 6th largest to the 5th largest spending item close behind welfare and soon to be more than military spending, there is not much the US can do. And they have to borrow money to pay the interest.When your country's revenue is mainly going to pay the interest on the loans for things you paid for in the past, no amount of shuffling the chairs or budget proposals or tax changes can put you back on the right track.What happens when the interest on the debt is 90% of the budget? Are people still going to squabble about how much money should go toward food stamps? I would just say...if I were the US, I wouldn't go buying any green bananas. Worst that could happen is I have no more of the shitcoin. Which puts me where I was 3 weeks ago. I don't see it surviving much longer. Especially since we get another shitcoin in November that will be very similar. So...if I wanted to take the free cash I got from the fork and short it at full margin on Bitfinex, where would I set my margin to the highest level? My tax plans include planning on living longer than the US exists.  Ahh yes, you are correct. I was thinking of the 0% rate. Even if you are a US citizen outside of the US.Current top of the 15% income tax bracket is $37,950 according to https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/12/04/your-guide-to-tax-brackets-in-2017.aspxAny earned income above that puts you into the 25% income tax bracket which also puts you in the 20% capital gains bracket. If I'm not worried about how long it will take for a transaction to go through...what is the minimum sat/b to set the fee?I see some transactions go through with a fee of .00038400. Will that work for any transaction?
Yep, if the amount you take out plus your income is over $38k you have to pay 20% on long term capital gains. Margin selling is just a loan, so you are not actually making a capital gain. You are just loaning out your bitcoins. Price ticker pics.This one is made to hang on the wall but I wanted it next to the TV and I'm not going to put a hole in the wall in this apartment. Just as a pre-emptive defense of my account being hacked.I do not know any royalty in Africa that need their money transferred out of the country in exchange for your bitcoins.  Just admit it man...you sold your account to get your fix on <insert current Silk Road name here> then came on here claiming you were "hacked".Well played my friend.  Then I have to stay up worry about how to protect my gold. Had a dream last night that I woke up and saw my bitcoin price ticker up over $400,000 and rising quickly. Saw it touch $500,000 as it came "crashing" back down to the high $300k range.With such high numbers I couldn't even think of how much money that meant I had...just that I was fucking rich. Then I woke up   I am pretty sure rootstock still requires federation to work, even with SegWit. Am I wrong on this?I thought there was some necessary code changes in order for this to work programatically on the current blockchain. My bitcoins came through the other side so shiny. I was offered what would now be about $2 per post if I put their ad in my signature.Still not going to do it. Though the bitcoin price did not skyrocket when it hit $4,400 I am comforted by the fact that we are not in an exponential rise. This whole bull run has been fairly conservative. I don't see a huge crash coming any time soon like we saw in 2013. If it continues it's fairly slow climb I will be pleased. Even if the climb slows to a crawl until the next quick rise. Will probably do this myself as well. Hard part will be moving the bitcoins to a new secure address. Ugh...I love how the first step in Electrum's offline linux version is to download python-qt4. I have time tonight. Time to install that BCH wallet on my extra computer. The only thing happening right now is that all of those people that wanted to cash their bcash for bitcoins already went through all of the trouble to do so. Now Ver and Wu are pumping their own bitcoins into bcash (I have seen the 500+ BTC buys pushing the price up on finex) and they are met with little resistance because nobody with bcash is there waiting to push the price back down.Once the price motivates enough people to install the wallet and get their bcash to the exchange, the bcash price will crash. Bitcoin is still going strong. I am buying some stuff from Amazon right now.The price is down a couple percent from this morning but still a pretty decent price. The only thing bcash accomplished today was holding off another bitcoin ATH this weekend. Weekend pump delayed while Ver and Wu dump their coins for yet another alt coin they're investing in. Didn't BCH fork off after the Segwit lock in? Or did they fork with a version that did not include it?Would make sense as Wu would not want to expose his AsicBoost usage once SegWit gets activated. Much easier to just create a whole separate chain where he can continue to use it to mine blocks at an advantage. I rent because 4 years ago I set a goal to make enough money to retire in 5 years. That meant that every decision in my life revolved around making the most money I possibly could in that short amount of time. In order to help in doing this I made it a point to make my living arrangement as flexible as possible, I sold everything I own other than what can fit in a carry on and backpack. This allows me to take a higher paying job at the drop of a hat. I have even told my employers that if I have to go live in some hot, dark jungle with bombs falling all around me I would take the job as long as the pay was higher. In my line of business being mobile is a huge plus. I literally left Germany for a job in Afghanistan with 5 days to prepare.I got rid of my credit cards years ago. Even if you plan on paying them off every month, life bites you in the ass sometimes and you use them as a crutch if you don't think you have enough money for the bill that month. Which usually ends in the card owning you. No debit card has made things difficult at times because things would be easier to just go to an ATM but I would be charged ATM fees plus currency conversion fees. I have been able to use bitcoins for such things in all but one instance on the Cambodian border.I don't really care about my transactions being recorded publicly. I mainly pay rent and shop on Amazon if you want to see .14 bitcoins being sent from my address or .04 bitcoins being sent. In my line of work I can never do anything illegal and I never do (that I know of...everyone breaks some law). If I wanted to hide my purchase (buying a sex doll or whichever) I would just send money directly from an exchange or whichever. I do think privacy is important and believe it can be done if you want to, and LN will make that even more possible. With my line of work, the government knows everything there is to know about me.I hold bitcoins as my main currency because it is the most convenient currency for me to hold and the value of my currency does not have the built in feature of losing value over time. I am not sure which currency I would hold if it wasn't bitcoin. Dollars? Euro? Won? I buy Won sometimes for spending money, I meet some guy in Seoul and he gives me a great rate, better than I could get from converting dollars to Won. I don't have a bank here in Korea. Bitcoin is much easier than trying to deal with all of that. I remember calculating the daily increase of value my bitcoins had in 2013, it was 1% per day. I converted each paycheck to bitcoins at a cost of 1%. That meant that if I got paid, then waited one week before purchasing something with that money, I made 6% return. Why would I only want to get 6% return on a small part of my pay when I could get that return on all of my pay? By looking at it as bitcoin being my main currency I don't play the game of keeping some dollars for spending then keep a certain percentage of bitcoins and go back and forth or whichever. Just do full on bitcoin and don't worry about playing that game. You can live on bitcoins, there's no reason not to.
No my chain is better...no mine is...no mine!Whatevs.Most of my bitcoin spending is done via third parties already. I am ok with that.I spend bitcoins on Amazon through Purse, I pay my rent through a Korean wire transfer service. I have bought gift cards to pay for meals in the US and buy food in Germany. It all gets recorded on the blockchain at some point. And it allows me to hold bitcoins as my main currency. I just want to use Bitcoin as a currency. I honestly do not care too much about the small differences between the two chains. They both have SegWit which will allow the Lightning Network which will allow for fast, cheap microtransactions. If bitcoin and bcash reach parity I will sell both and wait. Ver and Wu just went full retard selling all of their BTC for an alt coin. Real Estate is certainly a wise investment. But I look at the US long term real estate market with two major things hanging over its head. The baby boomer generation that is now the retiring generation and soon to be in the old folks homes generation leaving a lot of empty homes. Also, property only holds its value because the government protects those property rights. As the US debt climbs and the budget requires more and more money to fund just the interest on that debt there will be a struggle by the government to find new sources of revenue. Property owners may end up in the cross hairs (among many sources) as they are already paying taxes...what's another one added on. Either through their local government, the state or the federal government directly. Or just simply the expanded use of eminent domain. When the majority of voters do not own property...they now own your property. I feel a weekend pump coming...will we push above $5k or is that going to be a tough one to push through?On a different note I got a text from my sister of "wow, $4,400 that's amazing". I replied that I was pleased. She replied saying "you should start buying stuff".I didn't really understand what she was talking about so I asked "like what?". Her response was "property"..."or a mansion".I just told her I would rather retire than worry about stuff. Best thing to do is...buy bitcoins and hodl!h Or when you're driving and the other driver reports you. Try giving the nazi salute or giving someone the middle finger in Germany and see how far that gets you. A week or so ago someone queried why Ver doesn't just dump all of his bitcoins into bcash to pump the price. His response was something along the lines of "I'm seriously considering doing this". Perhaps this was that action. Electron Cash searches for an existing Electrum wallet and overwrites it.  I still have my bcash just because of the long process I went through to secure my private keys that I currently hodl (see my post about destroying my hard drive and burning my computer). I have a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications where we covered satellite technology as well as a Master's in IT. I have worked on military satellite systems. I see no scam in what they are doing. Seems pretty straightforward to me.  When looking at stocks and taxes it says that you can direct which shares you want your broker to sell, but you have to be ready to prove that you chose those shares.So in reality, even if you're doing FIFO or LIFO, if you want to choose a specific set of bitcoins to sell (older coins when you had been doing LIFO or newer coins when you had been doing FIFO) you can. As long as you prove that that is what you are doing. It also highlights why Bitcoin is so important. Imagine if the jews had bitcoin during WWII.  Classy. So we kicked out the idea of a double top and opened up a cup and handle.This means moon for sure.I predict a lot of resistance at $6666. There are tradeoffs to both. With FIFO you are more likely to be cashing out coins you had for over a year which are taxed at a lower rate. With LIFO you pay a higher rate but the difference in price from when you bought them to when you sold them is likely smaller. With my cryptosteel I created my public/private keys on a laptop that was completely off the network. Put the keys on the cryptosteel then took the hard drive out of the computer, opened it up, took out the disk and smashed it to pieces. Then I took the pieces and the computer itself and burned it in a fire. The cryptosteel are wrapped in a metallic tape that is not very common so I will know if it has been tampered with.Needless to say...fairly secure.
So...the next 24 hours are critical! As the dollar loses value this gif will eventually be funny for other reasons. I recommended people refinance their house and take a loan to buy bitcoins when the price was $325.The typical response was "I wouldn't go that far, buy but don't invest more than you can afford to looose.". So...was that a double top?Will the weekend get here soon enough to send us up to new levels? Not much that can be done. I've looked into as many tax loopholes as I can. I even had all of the paperwork ready to create an offshore business to funnel my bitcoins through but the controlled foreign corporation rules require any foreign corporation where you own 50% of requires you to declare capital gains that the company gets immediately even if the company does not distribute it to you.There are some companies that allow you to take out a loan on your stock options (which fixes the price) where they "hold" the stocks and you "fail to pay back the loan".Living overseas you can withdraw $38k per year and pay zero capital gains as long as you have no other income.Though a really good tax lawyer could probably figure something out. Tax "loopholes" are legal ways of not paying taxes that the tax legislators just haven't noticed yet.If your accountant tells you that there's no getting around paying capital gains taxes he's really saying there's know way -he- knows of how to get around them. There is always a way especially the more money you have. Bravo sir.Personally, I like the idea that I will live longer than the US government will exist. At that point I can cash out into whatever I want to and not have to pay taxes on it.I don't want luxury or "nice things". I want to live for hundreds of years and travel to new worlds. That will take money. I know that the IRS has specified that calculating your gains on bitcoin you should use FIFO or LIFO as long as you are consistent.But can you choose FIFO for bitcoin and then use LIFO for litecoin?The case use would be that you use FIFO and have fiat on an exchange that you want to move to another exchange but if you buy bitcoins then transfer to another exchange and sell you would be selling coins you bought years ago, not the coins you just bought. Thus requiring double capital gains.But if you buy litecoins, transfer to another exchange and sell the litecoins using LIFO then you would have zero capital gains on the transfer. You would only sell if it falls after reaching the top....double top. Exactly. There are thousands of years of rational market examples. Cherry picking a small sliver of time in some remote small country that had a market crash after a few months is pretty desperate. Why not point out the follies of the great depression or Black Monday? Or the market collapse in 2009? At least those are more recent and had a larger affect on the economy. It sucks that understanding Bitcoin also involves a 2 month market movement on some speculation that happened a few hundred years ago.The fact that they always have to bring up that small window of the market means they are trying to push an agenda and had to search all of history to find something that fit their narrative. Down almost 2% for the day. Might have to buy a lambo with just 3 tires.     I was looking at some old test transactions I did for my Bitpools site. I noticed that one address has .009 bitcoins in it. Now do I want to go through the trouble of tracking down where I put that private key? I guess I need to do some spring cleaning. Here you go R0ach, some gold hating crypto porn from Mises:https://mises.org/blog/why-cryptocurrencies-will-never-be-safe-havensGreat read, for example:Hilarious read if you want to read some commodity investor desperately trying to tell why Bitcoin has no value but really has no idea what Bitcoin actually is. When I sold my house last June I put all of the money in bitcoins mainly because I didn't know where else to put the money and didn't really have a plan for them. I wanted to use that money for a "safe" investment that could grow, I considered moving the bitcoins from the sale to Bitfinex to loan out at a high interest rate. Just never got around to it. Not many traders here. Most have learned our lesson and just buy and hodl.The reason for the upward movement? Many people are trying to figure out where to put their wealth for safe keeping. With a madman running the US economy and military, incompetent idiots running the other countries economies off a cliff and uncertainty everywhere, bitcoin has proven itself to be a store of value that will not be stopped. Everyone was just waiting to see if the hard fork and SegWit activation would cause any turmoil. Bitcoin survived both with no problems, demonstrating that it can grow and adapt over time as necessary.Investors have had 4 years to think about how they missed out on the big rise in 2013. They have been on the sidelines waiting. This time they will participate. And it will be glorious. Take out only what you need to spend. Use bitcoins for any spending that you can.If you need a safety net for some of your wealth, short bitcoin for as much as you might need over the next year or so (as much as you want to be secure). By shorting (without margin) you are effectively freezing your bitcoin wealth at the current price. The downside is you have to pay a few percent per year to do that and you risk having your coins on an exchange (perhaps spread between several exchanges). This avoids capital gains and allows you to pull it out at a later date as needed.At $38k total income you pay zero capital gains tax (this year). Might be best to do until you find a better way down the road (with a better CPA).I recall in 2011 asking my CPA what he thought about bitcoins. He just laughed. If I was worried I would not live in South Korea right now.(though I am about 10 feet away from 2 gas masks and a chemical suit...but that's not by choice) When the price was around $750 my sister asked if she should sell her .5 btc and my thoughts on the price.Based on the cup and handle thing people brought up here I told her that if the price broke $800 the price would skyrocket.Now she thinks I'm a financial genius Is that a 3 day cup and handle I see? Break $4190 and the price will skyrocket  Same answer being repeated over and over.Lock the thread OP.unsubscribe Living in Korea I mainly only see trading done on the exchanges, not much real world spending.It would affect the price about as much as all of the trading ceasing on an exchange like...oh..say, btc-e.
During a quick climb people hold off on selling because they don't know how high the price will go. When it starts to level out normal trading comes back in and people sell again.Funny thing is that with all of the crazy price action I locked in a $4k rate with an investment yesterday with someone but was traveling and couldn't get to my cold storage. I had no idea what the price would be when I finally did send the payment. The price was about the same as when we locked it in. I'm glad it returned to that price just in time, mainly because it was likely the first experience with real world spending of bitcoins for a few people and if the price had dropped $500 in that time it would sour them of the whole bitcoin thing and have them forever linking bitcoin to being "too volatile". For those that have seen me bring up seasteading before, I will post this sneak peek of something I've been helping work on for the past few months..https://www.blue-frontiers.com/token-offering/I don't know what I can disclose about it yet other than that it's gonna be yuuugge.. Ya...but that crash from $16,000 to $7,000...     I know the feeling. I remember in 2013 walking into work pumped because I was up 10k over night.My gf has been visiting me for a few weeks and my wealth has almost doubled since she got here. When I asked her if she wanted to go see a movie she said it was too expensive. I can just watch the movie at home for free. When I was in Afghanistan I always wanted to buy an MRAP. Get a sweet paint job with spinners. That being said, my first car out of college was a 1980 911 Carrera targa so I understand the desire. It is a fun car. Paid 10k for it. Paid much more than that in repair bills over the 5 years I had it. Certainly practical. Could come in handy soon. Even with my high net worth I bought an 1800 dollar car. Cars are bad investments unless you are trying to get some sort of business clients by displaying your wealth so that they will invest their money in you. Or to get a mate. I say that because anything that takes a lot of work would require motivation to keep working as opposed to just sleeping in and playing video games. It would not be fair to anyone if I started working on something that I believe in then bail once I grew bored of it or something else took up my time.I might consider writing a multiplayer seasteading video game. I worked on games in college and that was something I enjoyed doing voluntarily. But it was on my own schedule. Congrats. I reached that point too a while back. My whole life I spent my energy on working on making more money, college, personal sacrifice, business ventures, etc.Now that I make more with bitcoin than anything else, and I don't really need to make any more money for the rest of my life (though more opens up possibilities) it changes my life goals.Right now I go to work even though I don't need to. I have zero motivation, especially working for the military industrial complex. If it weren't for the fact that I have no stress at work and I work in a very relaxed atmosphere I would leave. Other people stress...but that is because they worry about their future careers. Though going to work is ok because it gives me a reason to get out of the house in the morning.Even thinking about things I can do with my life outside of work it tends to come back to working on something...which tends to be something that makes money. I need to figure out how to balance working on something that doesn't drain my funds and productivity while not worrying about making money off of the venture. Like I want to help with this seasteading venture and can contribute in many ways such as running their network or developing some blockchain stuff for them, but I keep thinking that I would need to get paid to do something big like that. But a small salary would only be symbolic for me, and a big salary would not be feasible. And if I wanted a big salary I would just keep doing what I am doing now.First world problems I suppose. I have been reading The Will to Power by Nitchze to kind of get into the heads of the bigwigs that I might start mingling with (and have already started to do) as more of a protective stance to not become an easy target. I will be delving into other books like that to get an idea of the mindset and to enlighten my mind a bit. In 2013 I told my friends that if it hit $2k I would charter a private jet to fly us all to Vegas.Now I wouldn't think of wasting my money like that when I can retire instead  I think the same way. I have a number picked out and say at price X I have Y dollars...so I can retire/buy a boat/etc.Then when the time comes I start thinking of capital gains and writing a check to Uncle Sam for over $100k to go toward their war effort.I have looked into every way possible of selling my bitcoins without paying taxes, even with the advantage of being overseas. The best I can do is take out $38k per year. Which means not selling.And thinking about it more, I feel more secure having my money in Bitcoin than in anything else in the world.So at this point, the price would have to drop about $2k for me to not be able to retire. And even then, I put aside this year's salary to put toward my first few years of retirement. So even if the price drops to $1k...in 2020 the block reward halves again.So I am at the point of hodling forever (taking out $38k per year down the road). Me now   btw...new ATH on finex and stamp Another weekend ATH?Ok. The current approach is a phased approach instead of the whole Waterworld thing.Phase 1:Set up a prototype in a Special Economic Zone in a friendly nation's protected lagoon. Work on some of the engineering challenges and other things that might come up but in a protected manner.Phase 2: Move 12nm out to sea. This has more wave activity which needs to be factored in but gives relative freedom from most of a nation's laws (like when you're on a cruise ship and you have to wait about 30 minutes until they're 12nm away from land before they open up the casino). You are still protected by the host nation and have easy access to the resources on land.Phase 3:200nm out to sea. This is where the engineering has to have everything taken care of for large waves and sea activity, but you are outside of any nation's jurisdiction and can be a sovereign nation.The Seasteading Institute and their spinoff company, Blue Frontiers, are actively in talks with French Polynesia to implement a Special Economic Zone with French Polynesia. I went down there in May and had dinner at the president's house where he gave a speech welcoming us and telling us he really wants to have seasteading flourish in French Polynesia. For a Tsunami, the safest place would be a seastead. Do you worry about homes on the coast due to tsunamis? Because that's who is affected. Out in the ocean the seastead just goes up and down. That is what seasteading is looking to achieve.Maybe not so much the cheap part initially though.Should be an announcement coming this weekend that is pretty significant. No idea. Like I said, living would be 3k per month not 300. When you start looking at higher costs it is more stuff catering to foreigners so the price can go up quickly.My friend has a house with a pool and he figures 2k is enough. There are several blogs of living from $300 to $600 or so in Thailand.$600/month https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v61xbAJoQVI$500/month https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoEYAl7Bk5Q$300/month https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHP1OrFUZFABut I am talking mainly about the locals living on that much. My gf has a 3 bedroom apartment she pays about $180/month for. Food is really cheap. Most things are really inexpensive.
Btw. For anyone who was wondering, I did some research on capital gains (United States).A single person can sell about $38k worth of bitcoins per year and pay 0% capital gains as long as you have no other income (twice that as a married couple). That's about $3k per month tax free if you can find a place to live on that comfortably (You can live on $500 per month in Thailand).Basically, If you are 30 and plan to live until 85 you only need about 150 bitcoins to retire right now, tax free.About 100 BTC if you are over 50. I currently live in South Korea. Have not visited Jeju Island yet. Will definitely give it a try. I have not been taking advantage of the country as much as I should though...mainly sticking close to home. I don't know why. Sadly for you, you don't understand that there are some places where all of those services are private and you are not forced to pay for them.My water company, internet company, phone company are all private companies that I don't have to use and they have competing companies so you go with the best service for you.Everything, and yes I literally mean EVERYTHING, can be taken care of privately without the government. Open your fucking minds and realize that taking money from people under the thread of violence is a pretty shitty thing to do. Call it theft, call it extortion, call it whatever you want...it's pathetic and wrong.Who is John Galt?I'm out. When I am 90 and I don't know better someone might stick me in an old folks home. Hopefully by then technology will put me at being middle aged. No, not a bar girl. She was actually my tour guide. We've met up a few times since. She's at my home right now cooking me some kick ass thai food.And no girl is marriage material for me. She may be great...but not half of my bitcoins great.The only way I would get married is some sort of tax break or if I'm in the old age home and they give me a special dessert with my dinner when you get married. The Chill Resort, Koh Chang. http://www.thechillresort.com/home/I highly recommend it.You can book it on expedia with bitcoins  I did a week in Thailand a few months ago. Great time, beautiful women. Cheap prices. You start to decide whether you want a nicer hotel for $45 or just go with a regular one for $25. Went to one of the islands and spent $200/night on a 5 star luxury hotel with a stairway to the pool right off of my patio on the ocean (sea?).I plan on retiring in January and will go live there. Got a beautiful gf out of the deal as well. So true. Taking someone's money is not theft if the person is not corrupt. Good government makes it not theft. Great point! Is this "sell the news" or speculation that once SegWit gets activated there will be problems?Or just the fact that the price stopped climbing so people will take this opportunity to sell some coins until the next leg up. When it comes down to it. Taxes are the price we pay to live in a civilized society. I know right!?!We all love paying taxes! I kept the private keys as well (hmm...do I sell their BCH?).When I was in town I showed my oldest nephew how to use it on Steam. He was pretty excited about it at that point. I gave my niece 1 bitcoin for her birthday back in December 2013 (when the price was $900/BTC). Throughout the year I gave each of my nieces and nephews 1 bitcoin for their birthday, the first being about $50 and the last being about $1k. My niece's mom, my sister, felt it was very generous when I gave it to her knowing the price (though I had paid about $20 each for the coins I gave away). But as the price fell over the next year my sister was soured of the whole bitcoin thing and kept asking me how to cash out the coin so she could put it in a CD or savings bond or whatever. I told her how but she could never figure it out (I had given her the private key in her birthday card). Finally last month she cashed it in and bought an iPhone.The point of the gift was not the money but the gift of learning about Bitcoin and giving the kids first hand knowledge of how to use bitcoins. The parents keep wanting to jump in and "save" their kid from this crazy Internet money by selling it and putting it in the bank or spending it.One nephew got it though. When the price went from $200 or so to $4-500 he said "if it went up that much, imagine how much it will be worth in a few years!".  I think my oldest nephew who is in college now probably spent his on drugs (or gift cards, who knows). I see seasteads as the next revolution in testing better governance systems. I am working in this sector and crypto is playing a huge role. My mother is retired. When she talks to her accountant the advice he gives her is to not live too long. Ok, you all convinced me. Seeing the same answer over and over by people with signatures must mean that it is true.I not think tax is theft. It depend on what it spent on. It good for society. I forgot to pay my rent at the beginning of the month.The price on August 1 was around $2,600. Today I paid when the price was $3,400.I'm glad I forgot.   This thread is not here to promote your alt coin because I am not looking to buy your alt coin.What I am considering is creating a currency for a small area (town) that can be used for every day purchases. No need for a world currency, something that is quick, easy and secure as far as transactions go. What are you guys feeding the bitcoin price?It's so big. I'm not sure who the wealthy elite are considered.But I am enjoying the new ATH.
I still see 112 blocks needed for lock-in on xbt.euWas worried about a double top when the price stopped at yesterday's high. But it jumped through easily.Yesterday I was watching the movie Dope while I had the price ticker next to the TV showing "All Time High". Pretty sweet.Then I watched Money Masters where they made mentions of the price being $400. Some guy bought a 1mBTC coin and said the coin was pretty cool as a collector's item but it was only worth pennies. As someone who has been here long enough, almost every thread turns to shit after about 5 posts. It is then just the same things repeated for 20 pages.I have locked several of my own threads because the answer to my question was given within the first page, only to be repeated over and over and over by anyone and everyone with signature links. We have observed him here pumping the price. He used about $12 million to pump it from around $2750 to $2850 but he had orders there waiting to sell at the higher price.The article's assumption that he is somehow getting around the wells fargo bank deposit restrictions with Bitfinex is wrong because he can always deposit bitcoins and sell them to get dollars (like when he pumped it to $2850).This concept of "spoofing" is very common on the exchanges to the point that people don't fall for it when they see a huge wall (other than the bots maybe). Pointing out that it is illegal (in what country?) doesn't change shit. Easy solution? Get rid of signatures and make a forum policy against advertising.Though it would result in a drop in traffic from these zombies so it would lose money for bitcointalk. Things are not looking good if you look at the unchanged inflation calculation.Bitcoin has a 10% built in price rise year over year vs the dollar. I want to cash out but the risk of whatever wallet software somehow getting my private keys is holding me back.Right now I know my private keys are safe. I do not want to compromise that...even though the reward for me is a lot. I suspect this is most of it.When merely posting is a paid commodity where quantity is valued and quality has no value then the overwhelming trend will be toward less quality and more quantity. I am starting a poll on this thread.Anyone who believes that we are owed the money of those that do not believe taxation is theft respond with the words "taxation is theft".If you do not agree, type "I support the thread tax".When the poll is tallied, those that do not believe taxation is theft will owe the rest of us money. You will provide your private keys publicly and we promise we will take what we think is fair. We also promise to do good things with it. Bcash price was 10% bitcoin, now it's 7%. How is that a rise? One of the responses in this thread on reddit lead a newbie to bitcointalk. His reaction:What are your thoughts on why there is such a reaction?#: I am self-moderating this thread because most threads end up getting spammed by people that sound like teenagers from non-English speaking countries that add nothing of value. Tim Draper. The only difference between rape and sex is consent.The only difference between theft and making a purchase is consent.So...in the days where the king required each bride to have sex with him first on the honeymoon, you would not consider that rape? Because it was legal?  It depends, do I have a choice whether or not I rent? Is it voluntary?If a woman is raped, would you tell her she should just go to a country with no men if she doesn't want to be raped? The rate has nothing to do with whether or not taxation is theft or not.If someone holds a gun to your head and says give me 10% of the money in your wallet, you get to keep the rest...is that still theft? Without taxes, the state cannot exist! That's Selma Friedman! Nobody has bitcoins on the exchanges to sell...they were all told to take them off for the hard forkit will take a while for people to try to sell at the top Bikerleszno is going to a bit of an extreme to get that .25 bitcoins. Chynahhh Is this gentlemen?
Bikerleszno is the winner...congrats! New ATH!!!Bitfinex I looked away from the price for a few minutes then looked up to see...$2950!Go baby go! Price is similar to other exchanges that accept bcash deposits. About 10% of BTC. If a small town were looking to create a "my town cryptocurrency" where they use it in all of their shops, salaries, coffee, government, etc. which protocol would be the best to replicate?As big of a supporter of Bitcoin as I am, I understand that you can use bitcoins for this. I have lived on bitcoin and paid for coffee with bitcoins, but I imagine some of the alts may have currency advantages over bitcoin like fast confirmation times and other features that would work better as a localized currency as opposed to a world currency.Any thoughts on this?  Set up a service to allow me to do that and I will.I can currently do it with bitcoin via many third party services. I just want to go with whichever chain allows me to buy a coffee now...and when I am an old man looking back 50 years from now I can point to that transaction and say "that was my transaction...it was a coffee and it was delicious". Is it voluntary? Yes. You can write an app to automate those clicks. So sad that you believe that only government can do these things. Even sadder that their propaganda has worked so well. Coinbase was holding a ton of peoples' bitcoins during the fork. Coinbase now has a whole lot of bcash to sell.Ipso facto...Coinbase is cashing out their BCH. A quick survey that should help.http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=9fgng77f80xbtr9177028 Umm..what?How is 25 BCC (at 10% the value of BTC) mined per day more profitable than 300 BTC per day? Interesting. If someone takes your money on the street without your consent, would you say that is theft? Or would it depend? Same here. I have some dust on bitfinex and bittrex.Maybe in 20 years when bitcoin is worth $100 million, bcash will be worth $10,000 and I can sell it for a coffee. That was your first mistake. And you all lose the game that is life.Enjoy your safe space.Thread locked. Interesting theory, I do not believe I have ever heard that before. Care to elaborate? Yep. Yet another topic inundated by signature freaks.Yet another thread to lock. It will be interesting to see which dormant BTC addresses move to sell their Bcash tokens.Will give a better idea of which addresses are dead and which are just hodling.
The initial euphoria for the poor after killing capitalism and moving to socialism is akin to a zombie apocalypse. Suddenly, even the poorest person can go out and get any car they can get their hands on, they can go to any grocery store and get as much food as they want, they can go live in a mansion. They are now "rich". Oh, and by the way...there is no more gas being produced, food will be scarce and nothing new is being created. But hey...free stuff! August 19. The only place you can actually deposit your BCH the rate is .07 and falling. HitBTC allows BCC deposits.Price of BCC on HitBTC is $239. So the combined sale of both BTC and BCH comes to over $3100. I believe most of the trademarking early on was done by MtGox and possibly bitcoin.comTheoretically, if I recall from 2011-2012, they opened it up for public use. First things I have seen on reddit, BCH is failing.  Hmm, but what about BIP148? I thought that was at midnight. So is it August 1st wherever it's supposed to be August 1st yet?  Fees are voluntary. This month?As in July? The thread is called "wall observer" due to the wall of text we have to read in every post. I did have a theory on something that could push the price up a lot over time.There was something like 600k bitcoins stolen from MtGox which apparently was flowing through btc-e being sold off over the years. btc-e has always had a lower price which may have kept the price low over the years. Now that the admins are on the run and they do not have btc-e to sell their coins they have stopped that flow of large amounts of bitcoins onto the market. Without this downward pressure, who knows how high the price will go. This is just a well promoted alt coin. The question was not how well things work.The question was "Is taxation theft?"Your response that taxation is not with consent would lead to the reality that taxation is theft. Later actions alter past actions.If you have sex with a girl without her consent it is not rape if you later bring her flowers and offer to take her to a fancy dinner.Just like taking money from someone without their consent is not theft if later you spend the money well. I am glad that there are so many people here on my side.This weekend I went and robbed some old lady's house (she didn't even lock the door! ha!), but not to worry. I donated some of the money to charity after I went and bought some burgers for myself and I did not take all of her money so it was only a percentage.Because the money was put to a good cause then it was not theft.Thank you everyone for re-affirming the fact that I am not a thief. I doubt the old lady would have donated her money to charity, which I believe is her duty. She should not get to decide on her own.It is good to know that the action of taking her money without her consent can be deemed ok as long as another action later on negates that action.Like if I kill someone but later I do a good deed...I did not commit murder.I believe I will live the rest of my life on this philosophy. Do bad....but do good later to even things out. unsubscribe SegWit at 100% this difficulty period:Let the countdown begin.
I had 21,000 NMC on there. Never bothered to create a wallet because they weren't worth much. Until they were. And I couldn't get them off the site. Most people would not eat human until they saw this human with chocolate:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wYigjLzhwA  I am wondering if the big investors will not believe btc-e is down until a reliable source confirms it. Drunk posting on bitcointalk is how legends are made.hodl onto your beer The sad thing is that it might be easier for me to get my namecoins from BTC-e from the government than it is getting past their verification process due to a frozen account. After sending a copy of my passport and 3 months of bank statements they rejected it saying they needed a notarized ID scan from a third party, 3 months of proof of salary, utility bill, bank statements (all notarized) etc.In other words, they want to keep all of my coins and no amount of verification will suffice. While we are all worried about BTC-e, what about all of those other hosted services that are going to be offline in Russia for 5 to 10 days due to unscheduled maintenance? What about all of those guys...and how this will affect a major hosting service?Always thinking of yourselves.Shame! This. Signature campaigns are great. People posting contribute such great advice and insight that we have not heard before. Apparently the name of the guy who was arrested is Alexander. Same name as one of the admins of BTC-E.My guess is the other founder got wind of it and took the cold storage and started mixing it right away. 66,000 BTC at least. How should we invest the money made in our signature campaigns though? I agree. A purge of this whole US Drug War would go a long way toward making society better.Labeling every little thing as "money laundering" just because you can't track every penny in the world is ridiculous. Bitcoin exchange is an "e-crime website"? Give me a break. AlphaBay went down weeks ago. I have a significant amount of NMC on BTC-e. I haven't seen a lot of transactions in the last 24 hours that would indicate that their NMC wallet was hacked.Though I've been trying to get access to my account for the past month but they won't let me log in until I'm verified (I did not log in for over a year). How many multi-million dollar companies have their servers in a place where their host has unscheduled maintenance?That shit should be on triple redundancy systems with any maintenance requiring at least 24 hour advanced notice of any downtime. literally The longer btc-e is down, the lower the price will go on speculation that yet another exchange was hacked. This thread is a lesson on the simple action of reading for context. Best value is to buy the tungsten directly in bars and cover it in gold yourself.Though tungsten prices are rising due to demand for "gold bars".
My assumption has been that he bought heavily into ETH and wants Bitcoin to fail and be replaced by ETH. Yep. One big scam, everyone's going to get so screwed. lolIf person A is opening a channel to person C and you are in the middle, person B you need to cover the amount that they are transferring back and forth. The person in the middle can charge whatever percent they want, but once there is a large network of providers the cheapest route will be used.Person A is basically "sending" you bitcoins and you're "sending" bitcoins back to them, you are "sending" bitcoins to person C and they're "sending" bitcoins back to you. Now Person A can send to Person C as many times as they want and Person C can send to Person A as many times as they want. The transactions are "recorded" by you and settled at any time or at the end of the lock-in period.Depending upon how much they want to open the channel for, you need to have enough bitcoins to cover both sides. So twice the size of the channel.Many people will be opening free channels at first though I imagine...to become trusted channels so they can charge down the line. This guy totally gets the point of this thread. That will be the Lightning Network. You'll have to have bitcoins to feed the channel. BCC stands for Blind Carbon Copy.They are creating a carbon copy of bitcoin that nobody else can see or use. Someone dumped 1000 BTC on Bitfinex which caught a few people in a long trap. Bigger blocks on a second later will be pretty sweet. Lightning Network...this ones goes to a billion. https://lightning.network/ Alex Jones probably.Or an alien.I repeat myself. So what do the bits in the charts show?Is there a BCC fork going on?  What could possibly go wrong? This. Always obey authority. They know what is best. Not you, peasant. haha Someone taking something from someone without their consent does not "become theft" depending upon how they then spend that stolen money.The act itself is what classifies it as theft. Not actions taken afterwards. $90 to ATH on Bitfinex bump Dude, people are answering the same thing over and over in this thread. We get it.How do I unsubscribe to a thread I've commented in?Stop posting in this thread so it doesn't keep going to the top of my unread threads list. Thank You. Yep, my buddy today was shocked when I said you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. He said he had to re-think his whole strategy now.I really don't care about getting someone to buy bitcoins just to make money.I think the next person to ask me about investing in bitcoins I'll give them a speech about the evils of the Federal Reserve and why Bitcoin is important for the future of liberty. If they let me finish I'll walk them through buying their first bits.My buddy who actually started buying about $400 worth per paycheck last year bought it after I told him to download the wallet then sent him $10 worth of bitcoins. That is usually the best way to show the power of Bitcoin. The wheels start turning then.
He's out now. Pulled his walls.You don't slowly push the price up if you're buying. Price is holding though. The dude has enough money to push it over the ATH. Perhaps he's hoping for a short squeeze and has a lot of bitcoins to dump at a high price. Looks like he is walking it up just like a classic whale pump and dump. I'm thinking the person putting in the $12 million worth of bids is trying to win the ATH thing and collect the .25 BTC.Rigged! I agree, I used to be huge in favor of gold and silver. If I had an easy way to store it and was settled down somewhere I would have some. But Roach's constantly pushing it is like a used car salesman trying to get rid of his inventory at an overvalued price. Someone?With such well distributed bids it has to be several people. It's not like one person poorly made it look like there are several bidders.   This has been me all summer.Friend: Hey I guess I should have listened to you this whole time when you told me to buy bitcoins, good for you. Can I ask you a question?Me: Sure (thinking: ok, time to point him to a bitcoin exchange finally)Friend: I've been reading about this new up and coming cryptocurrency <insert alt here>, do you think I should invest in this new coin?Me: *facepalm* Hey gang. I have no life and have run out of things to do in my mom's basement.Does anyone know of a good gold speculation forum I can go to and talk about bitcoin all day? The only reason I would do it is that I have no life. I have no interest at all in gold but I think they would appreciate me talking about bitcoin in a place where they go to discuss gold.Any help would be appreciated. I suspect that half of the names on that list are the same person. I'm not sure how most of it works but could NMC be used as a simple address tool for Lightning Network transactions?From the looks of things you have to enter a long string to connect to a channel. Would be easier to connect to xyz.bit Litecoin dropped a little bit the day SegWit activated then climbed naturally from there to over $50/LTC. Everyone at work is like "click click click...I'm doing work...same old boring life".I'm like booyaaa bitches...SegWit locked!  Boy do I have egg on my face. What was I thinking?Way off.Mea Culpa. Locked!!!!Now what? 4 5 Profit taking is not happening because people do not know if the price will go to new ATH or keep going to $4-5k.8 blocks to lock-in. I just want to stay up all night and watch the price and the BIP91 blocks. But I can wake up and watch the final blocks at work in the morning so that will be nice.Like going to sleep the night before Christmas. Cup and handle confirmed.
 So...ya, Bitcoin price is up. Tomorrow should be interesting. Like the Friday of the ETF decision.But this time everyone watching blocks. 80 blocks needed with 100 blocks to go with 80.5% in the past 144.It could lock in this round. It might come down to the wire. Make up your mind trend. It is amount of blocks mined with BIP91. If some miner that does not support BIP91 mines extra blocks, it'll lower the number. And vice versa. Has to lock in for anything to change. It hit 80% after the lock in period already started meaning it would need to be over 80% for that same amount of time to average out. Price is holding fairly steady waiting to see if it locks in. Even if it does not, the next lock in period over the weekend should push it through. It is a twitter locked in contract. Prediction:BIP91 will not lock in this time. It will lock in this weekend which will bring with it a weekend pump.Price prediction: $500,000/BTCIn 3 years or I will watch John McAffee eat his own dick on TV. And the alt market...Bitcoin ICOs.  I had a crappy old 911. It lost value and cost a lot to repair. BIP91 at 74% (last 144 blocks). If you can buy tungsten directly instead of being passed off as gold it is a lot cheaper.  What I look forward to most is Lightning Network. Ahh, I think the blue in the second line is the % of BIP91 for a longer period...perhaps a day or so. So, can someone explain the blue shading and black lines under the graph on herehttps://www.xbt.eu/  Considering BIP91 is at 63% and SegWit is at 22%...all the SegWit folks need to do to get SegWit activated is to add the BIP91 bit and wait for 2 days and we will have SegWit with 85% participation. Then with BIP148 it will fill that last 10% to activate in the Core client. Done. The price has been following activation for a while. The dump over the weekend came right after Garzick announced that the software (that was supposed to be released) was not ready.Rebounded after the software was released and miners started using it.
Predicted when the price was in the $1800s  BIP91 now at 60%It needs 80% to activate. John McAfee is taking bets:https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/887012614131372032Send legal contract bet to:John McAfee98 Scott Street. Lexington, TN. 38351I would definitely take a $500k bet knowing that in 3 years I can sell one of my bitcoins for $500k to pay off the bet happily. Or he gives me $500k. Win win. I'm not sure if this is a healthy correction to the huge increase we had over the past few months or what. It seems like SegWit news is keeping it alive but I'm not sure of the cause for this rally in the first place so who knows. If the big investors are still looking at bitcoin as a safe place for their money there is plenty of room upwards. Because they can. For all of those people that are ok with someone taking your money as long as the money is used for "good" with only a little bit of corruption, please list your bank account login information along with your bank wire codes. I promise I will do some good with your money. You are now bound by this social contract I just created.Also please PM me your bitcoin private keys. I promise not to steal your bitcoins. I will only tax them.Please let me know what sort of costume I should wear and maybe a picture with some symbols behind me to set your mind at ease to ensure you that I am official. Maybe a shiny star on my chest, an awkwardly shaped hat that shows you that I am not just some regular guy stealing from you but someone who is there to help the community.I also promise to make all of your dreams come true. If that helps. Reminds me of all of these socialists that go around whining about capitalism as they go to the grocery store to buy their choice of a wide variety of food with their iPhone in their pocket. I suggest you stay out. Fiat will give you everything you could ever hope for. New ATH August 19th. So...if someone takes something from you without your consent, it only matters if the person is corrupt to determine if someone took something from you without your consent (ie. theft). Maybe here:https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0091.mediawiki BitMain announces they will start mining BIP91 today:"All our #bitcoin mining pools will start running the new #Segwit2x software today"AntPool mines their first BIP91 block:https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/block/00000000000000000132f9a480325ffad6fd2a4d67499fabd2e13978288763b0 Bah. You ruined it. I wanted OP to explain it all to me. How he is such a genius for coming up with the idea of Beanie Babies and Bitcoin...as if he is such an economic mastermind.I am sure he would have eventually mentioned tulips too. And also thought that he was being original on that one too. Most don't like it because of religion.The key is that the goal of it is to activate SegWit before August 1st with the miners. After that we can all forget it and move on. I read the whole page. Fascinating! Those are some great toys.But why post about a toy in Bitcoin Speculation?I genuinely want to know. Corruption is a symptom of people believing that extortion is morally acceptable. Source? Could you elaborate on the Beanie Babies reference? I have never heard of that before. I am genuinely curious. You are just seeing a donation phase of n00bs that bought into the hype at a higher price now selling into the hype of a drop in price.Thank you n00bs. Maybe modern society should not exist as it does. A society built on theft creates more problems than it fixes.
Prediction:BTC1 (Segwit2x) will be released Monday for the miners to test sending the bitcoin price back above $2300. Most would not recognize this technical analysis pattern as they are still using old tools but this is a little known pattern known by all of the experts: Alex Jones is a hack. I know for a fact that he doesn't check the sources of his news.I was on a satire website called "The Obama Forums" where we trolled anyone and everyone who came to the site with fake threads (it was pretty obvious if you spent 5 minutes reading the ridiculous stuff we put on there. We had one thread that said "List all of the websites that are anti-Obama and we will make sure they are blocked when he is elected". We had many right wing websites including Alex Jones's page.He eventually got wind of this and went on his radio show claiming that Obama wanted to block conservative websites including his own.The dude is smart, I'll give him that. Scaremongering for money. Do what you gotta do I suppose. Double bottom is in. Good article on what dates to keep an eye on.https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/countdown-segwit-these-are-dates-keep-eye/It looks like BIP91 will be a better way to activate SegWit next week as it would have miner support. BIP148 just kinda forces their hand to do it themselves first. I see...yesterday the software for SegWit2x was supposed to be ready for testing but:So the price is certainly following SegWit activation. The delay made people anxious and the price dipped. When it was announced that Litecoin would use SegWit the price went from $10 to mid 30s. When SegWit activated the price crashed to the low $20s. Then gradually climbed to new ATH of over $50 over the span of a month or so. But Adam was created in the image of God. A a male with a penis. Or else, why would there be a need to make Eve different, with female reproductive parts?If he is the only God, why would he need a penis that is used for reproduction? August 1st it is safest to have your bitcoins off of the exchange in a wallet.Some people may have figured out that it's also "safe" to have your money on the exchange in dollars.I think August 1st will be anticlimactic. Strange USD funding wall on Bitfinex...$5.5 million at .03%.Usually the funding is in the hundreds of thousands at most.Not sure what it means, a lot of people can go long for a very low rate.  Some people think that this thread is called "Wall Observer" because we watch walls on the charts.The reality is that we watch walls of text. Or in the age of digital currencies, the Internet and advanced technologies we can come up with something other than extortion to derive funds for public projects.One example of many yet to be tried methods would be Dominant Assurance ContractsWhy are new methods not being tried? Because the easiest solution is to have someone pay money under threat of violence. As long as that is socially acceptable, there is no easier method. If you hate getting raped it's simple, go some place where there are no men. I do not consent. Current price: $2323This is gentlemen! Europe has websites that advertise escorts like going to Amazon.com. The prudish countries like Iran and the US aren't used to such things.http://www.ladies.deNot that I ever partook. Strange that they are making the OpenBazaar of Sex when they could just use OpenBazaar and create an interface for sex. If someone steals your wallet, then goes and donates your money to charity...is it theft? The act of taking your money without your consent has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with what is then done with the money. Those are TWO SEPARATE ISSUES. Why do you assume that extortion is the only way to fund large projects?Ever bought your own food to survive? Getting that food from a seed, grown, harvested, packaged, shipped, put up for sale. That's a pretty big task...feeding everyone. How does that get paid for?
I thought Hinduism was more of a philosophy or way of life than a religion. Except when you pay for a box office payment you are doing so voluntarily. Paying for a service you want for an agreed upon price. The act of taking money without permission becomes theft if the money is not spent well? That's like saying "non-consensual sex with a woman would easily become rape if she does not have an orgasm" What was being tested? Segwit or Segwit2x? In Medieval Iceland the legislators were called Chieftains who represented their Assemblymen (basically the head of a household). The Assemblymen were able to choose their Chieftan no matter where they lived. By having a choice of Chieftain it kept them in line. It put some competition in governance. I would say this is the calm before the storm.I suspect that as Aug 1st gets closer people will have itchy trigger fingers on both sides of the aisle sending the price all over the place.Though detaching the price from any known position does tend to send it upwards to higher rates. Of course followed by several crashes, etc. If taxes gave you value for your money it would be voluntary. Does anyone truly pay their taxes with the money in their pocket?Or do they use a third party service to send their money to the IRS? So the original wall observer chain won out over all of the fork attempts. BULLISH!1 It does not matter what the money is spent on.Are taxes voluntary in any country? Are taxes voluntary? Price has leveled off pretty well in the $2300-$2600 range. A bubble pop would have sent the price spiraling down. Seems fairly stable. When does one choose to have a government?I do not consent. Is there a way to lend USD on Poloniex or can that only be done on Bitfinex? If Mother Theresa was born because her mother was raped....would the rape be ok because it resulted in something good? Taxation is rape without the sex. That's like saying that rape is good if the woman has an orgasm. Is taxation consensual? Are you forced or is it voluntary.Plenty of things in this world are funded without force. What makes you believe everything can't be funded without force? It was mainly due to a correction from a jump over $1k that was far too soon. The correction made for a declining price. The longer the price declined, the less people saw it as a good investment which made it decline even more. And the longer that went on, the worse the track record and the less attractive it was to investors to invest in something that kept losing value month by month. Miners were no longer Bitcoin enthusiasts who held their bitcoins but Chinese miners who sold their bitcoins immediately to pay for high electricity and equipment costs. Miners selling with no new investors to meet the demand meant declining prices. The many bitcoin auctions of the Silk Road bitcoins added quick boosts of supply to the market.Add to that the speculators that could make money by shorting bitcoin or selling their bitcoins in the hopes of buying lower (which was profitable). The trolls pointed to the "willy bot" saying the jump over $1k was created by MtGox. News reports constantly pointed that Bitcoin died when MtGox crashed "Bitcoin hacked!" or some CEO of a Bitcoin company died which turned into "CEO of Bitcoin died". The longer the price declined, the more people believed that the "Bitcoin experiment failed" selling at the bottom. I was quite sad when in the last years they stopped being voluntary.
 Everything you need to know about Bitcoin August 1st is here:http://lmgtfy.com/?q=bitcoin+august+1st Speaking of governments.Does anyone know of any software tools that currently exist to record things such as land titles and other governance types of remediation over the blockchain? I know that these things are theoretically possible, just wondering if anyone had an open source implementation or an open project. I think nations would crack down on it as some sort of money of the enemy or bans for "national security". It would go underground and likely be the only way many people can feed themselves.Every time there is a terrorist attack in Europe they try to pass some sort of new anti-Bitcoin law.Fiat currencies fuel war. With so many countries on the brink of collapse I would not be surprised by that desperation leading to some sort of world war. That tends to be a nation's way of covering up their financial problems and pulling everyone together under some false sense of threat. I know some people that keep all of their long term investments in fiat currencies that have the built in feature of losing value over time. Hmm, another Wall Observer fork.Is this a sign of things to come in August? I chose to leave the US because I do not want to give money to a country that uses the money to fund terrorists.Not having a choice does not change the fact that the current way of taking money to fund governments is wrong. Are you saying that in your country you don't pay for your own dentist like they do in the US?I am a big fan of necessary spending programs.But extortion is still wrong.Extort: to wrest or wring (money, information, etc.) from a person by violence, intimidation, or abuse of authority; obtain by force, torture, threat, or the like.http://www.dictionary.com/browse/extortIf governments were funded by rape would you still excuse it because of the necessity of government spending? It is sad that people who are actually witnessing a new way to create a currency via Bitcoin still believe that the only way for things to get funded is through the threat of imprisonment. So you should only be extorted in one way instead of two. I guess that is better. I had so much invested in the pre fork Wall Observer thread. Does that transfer over? Does this thread support more transactions?As to the point of the old thread...we are all here discussing the bitcoin price but sometimes we get bored and want to talk about other things and there are some really smart people in this thread who have been around for a while.As for Litecoin and Segwit. The price was about 3 dollars forever. It started to climb to around 9 when bitcoin started rising. Then they announced Segwit implementation and it flew up from there. So...bitcoin transactions are getting cheaper...  I had a nightmare that the price dropped to $300. The nightmare part wasn't that the price was so low, it's that I could not get to a computer to buy more as I watched the price shooting back up over $800 finally getting to a computer but I couldn't log in.  What if God was one of us? Seems legit.  Not all human parts.There is a part of the female human anatomy that I enjoy eating. The fix is in folks. It looks like a lot of bitcoin users have discovered this great currency called the dollar and are buying it all up. I heard that this dollar thing has a feature where it is made from paper. Bitcoin doesn't have that. Should we upgrade to get more users? You don't have to use the term "gender" when referring to sex. That term only came about because people were too prudish to use the term "sex" when referring to male and female. The term "gender" was mainly used to refer to objects or words such as is used in other languages.
There are many people that will buy other peoples' accounts. Legendary folks can make some decent money. I was offered somewhere around what would be over $2 per post for a signature campaign. I started doing the calculations of just logging and posting 10 posts a day from Thailand with $600 per month of extra spending money with no work. I could be like these other signature campaigners and post tons of shit posts or start arguments just for the money. But I know that would compromise my posts and make posting on here work instead of fun.I also got an estimate on selling my account outright that was over half a bitcoin. Plenty of people want the quick money. If there is only one God with no female mate...why have a penis? I'm not claiming God does not exist. I believe based on personal experiences. I do not put a lot of faith in religions as I understand that propaganda is everywhere and has existed forever.If he does not beget (have children) and there is no equivalent...what would be the point of having a penis? Which is meant to be used to reproduce with a female.  So...how do you think new investors will react to stability when they're expecting rocket ships? Been flat all day.Sold enough for a new (to me) car. Less than 1 bitcoin. 2 years ago I sold 12 bitcoins for my car worth about 6k euro. Now with the price up I splurged with an $1800 car. Maybe this is what economists warned everyone about how a deflationary currency encourages people to save instead of fueling the economy. Or I have higher priorities of retiring early instead of being seen in a fancy new car. I spoke briefly with an accountant and he mentioned that the controlled foreign corporation rules might make it difficult to go this route.From the quick perusal of those rules it looks like any gains made by the corporation have to be paid by the US citizen as if all income were to be distributed that year as opposed to any long term deferred income.Now, considering the bitcoins are loaned...it does not seem like that would count as a capital gain. The loan is a debit while the total cash is the equivalent credit. But if that were the case, the company would not need to be a foreign company since even a US company with no capital gains would not pay taxes. I hope the price goes up. I'm selling some bitcoins to buy a car.A classic Tuscani with 4 wheels and a sunroof. So...weekend lift or dump? Only if I knew that the cook knew how to prepare it. And if the price on the menu was reasonable.It would also depend on the nationality of the human.Like maybe he is Italian but I am craving Mexican.Or maybe his name is Caesar and I want a salad.Too many variables. Which sex is God?Does He have a penis or a vagina?If He has either...and there is only one God...why would he need reproductive organs? Billionaire spends a billion dollars to destroy Bitcoin...Litecoin becomes the new main cryptocurrency.Next...Or Bitcoin 2.0 is created without the billionaire's coins. The key difference between Bitfinex and Bitstamp is leverage. Most of the people using leverage will be near the current price.You're not going to borrow dollars so that you can put a buy order at $2500 (paying interest on that money daily). Whatever the miners run it better be compatible with BIP148. I am thinking that Core not supporting SegWit2x may be because after SegWit is activated, all eyes will be on them to raise the block size to 2mb. By not supporting it they can push for just moving on with SegWit and LN instead. They are also balking at the 3 month timeline which is not a lot of time for testing something that would fork the chain.I can also see that the miners are agreeing to this compromise because they see that BIP148 will probably get SegWit activated so they might as well try to get the 2mb if they can.Either way, it's looking like we will have SegWit some time around August.  The jump over $2700 was a bit quick. We were in the $2500s just 2 days ago. Quick jumps come with sell offs. The price on August 1 will definitely be different. Looking at the few blocks not supporting SegWit2x shows that it is mainly small pools that didn't indicate anything and slush pool which indicates support for SegWit.https://coin.dance/blocks  So I was thinking about the price and how it relates to velocity of money. As we get more transactions and LN which will allow for very fast velocity of bitcoin, would that send the price up or down? 2014...pretty safe to say that this BREAKING NEWS did not happen./thread
Don't invest in bitcoin.Convert from your old currency to bitcoins. Happens every...single...time.Huge sell walls are great. The whale is manipulating up. Could be a head and shoulders, unless it's not.The price has been pretty gradually climbing over the past few days. Not a quick jump.I see it as a struggle between this huge bull wave we have and all of the hodlers who got a glimpse of the huge 25% drop and started thinking about their exit strategies cashing out some of their coins. Certainly healthy as they will not likely panic sell later. The incoming investors are still flowing in.A gradual climb to $3k would be better than a quick run up. Hitting just below $3k and dropping again would not be a good thing.We've been going up about $50 per day which would put $3k around next week. From the headlines I've seen...Segwit2x is like calling the surveillance law the PATRIOT Act. It does not mean what you think it means. People agreed on it thinking it was Segwit plus 2Mb blocks. This is not so. Anarchists will make a deal with the statists.We end the government and all anarchists will voluntarily devote 5 hours a week to building the roads.Deal? I just signed on as a volunteer for a new seasteading company, Blue Frontiers, as part of the Blockchain group. We had discussed an ICO at the conference but their legal folks are pretty sure that stuff will be stamped out by the SEC at some point. I believe we might go the route of allowing for purchase of equity with bitcoins. My input to the group will definitely push the concept of being able to invest bitcoins to get invested.I believe the main push will be toward recording property rights on the blockchain. Can't really record a seastead deed in some government office. Seems legit. I plan on opening a hotdog stand and creating a private blockchain for inventory management. My amatuer look at the charts would say that we will soon rise to 3500. I usually buy corn when I buy the dip. As Mitt Romney said, you can legally not pay your taxes.Or at least, keep your tax footprint small. From what I have seen, SegWit will make it transparent whenever a miner uses the ASICBOOST exploit. I would imagine this would accelerate a full fix. No capital gains but most have income tax which the person would have to pay if they were drawing a salary from the corporation. Though in your scenario of getting a loan it would not matter. Belize would be high on that list due to their policy of somewhat decent privacy laws for their banks. Consider this option.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1963054.0 It would not be a Bitmain "User Activated Hard Fork" it would be a Bitmain Activated Hard Fork (BAHF). I had 2 people in the same day ask me about PotCoin. I don't know anything about it other than the obvious that they are trying to make a crypto for the pot shops in the US. I just told them that it would be a good investment if it is actually being used in the shops. With the knowledge that some of the shops are switching to bitcoin payments. Any shitcoin with no hard limit is doomed to fail. I also heard that it is not very decentralized.The only people who have seen the whitepaper are a few people that met on Jekyll Island over 100 years ago. I believe ZenCash is working on something like that or already did.  Looks like the weak hands are leaving bitcoin for the hodlers. They can tell their grandchildren that they invested in bitcoin way back in 2017 when it was only 4 digits but they got scared when the price dropped so they sold it all. I bought the dip but I have no idea how that is supposed to get me more bitcoins.
I find it strange that so many people just accept money laundering laws and KYC as just something that needs to be done to stop the bad guys. No big deal because you're not a bad guy so the government should know every transaction you make because...terrorists and drug dealers.Just like gun control laws its not to stop the bad guys. Its about controlling the people and being able to stop whomever they want so the government can gain more and more power.Now every time a terrorist attacks they use it as an excuse to pass more laws to control the flow of money just like how every time there is a shooting somewhere they use it as an excuse to pass more gun laws.Their ideal is a world where they only allow you to spend money on whatever they allow along with having no way to fight back if you want control over your own life. Now we have a bunch of n00bs who just bought bitcoins for the first time thinking "I thought the price only goes up 10x". They will panic sell within the month to pay bills unless we reach new highs. But those n00bs are also panic thinking "just let it get back to my original investment so I can sell and go back to my meager life of no risk" Thank you, that is what I was wondering. Where the sticking points will be. It just seems better if it was a loan since the person moving the btc will not be getting any assets in return such as stocks and just giving does not seem like it would fly. If you live overseas you do not have to pay income taxes on the first 100k of income. That is the very first time in history that tulips have been brought up when it comes to cryptocurrency. First time ever.Is the writer a genius? Amazing that he could find such an event in history and then correlate it to modern technology. Wow. Absolute genius. Is taxation voluntary? I beg to differ.Not everyone believes in non-consentual activities. Wether someone loans the company the bitcoins or invests it in the company doesn't really matter. The part I am concerned about is when they sell the bitcoins for dollars.  Just as I said when the price rose 10% in one day that it will correct itself...a 10% drop will certainly correct itself too (as it appears to be doing). Well, it was good while it lasted. Time to go buy a bunch of treasury bonds and hope they take off. Hypothetical scenario so that nobody is giving legal advice:Say a US citizen were to create an offshore company in the Cayman Islands or Turks & Caicos where there is no income tax nor capital gains taxes.The individual then loans this company some bitcoins. Say an even million dollars worth. That company then sells the bitcoins and puts the dollars in a bank account.The company then buys a car in its name, a boat in its name, and pays this US citizen a yearly salary below the 100k cutoff for expats living overseas. The owner has full use of the company vehicle, boat, etc.Would there be any legal challenge for this individual?This person is also not doing it for tax avoidance purposes. S/he was already planning to start a business and wanted to start one in a business friendly nation. Half of the posts in this thread are pumping the fragile ETH. I used to do modeling and simulation of military networks and was given a new MOSPF (Multicast Open Shortest Path First) protocol that was supposed to be superior to the network standard used at the time to create a model of and simulate against the standard model. I worked on these models for months and finally compared the two and found that the new protocol was far superior. I immediately invested in the company that owned the protocol figuring this was a great advance in networking. I invested when the stock was at $2. I cashed out when I wanted to close my Scottrade account at a few pennies. Fortunately I only invested $1k. It was also about the time of the dotcom bubble popping so there's that... The key thing to remember is that all of these people buying right now will likely not be buying during a year or two of dropping prices. They want the quick buck and are not thinking long term. I was on a "financial independence" reddit forum where people talk about investment strategies to get to financial independence and a few are talking about how close they are and how they are considering investing in bitcoin to get them over the top.Just more opportunity for me to buy their cheap coins like I did during the last bear market. I will not be satisfied until I can buy 10k pizzas with 1 bitcoin. In 2013 it went like this.First bubble:Double in a monthDouble in 2 weeksDouble in 1 weekDouble in half a weekUp a bit then crashSecond bubble:Double in a monthDouble in 2 weeksDouble in 1 weekUp a bit then crashRecently we doubled in a month (1250 to 2500) but then it flattened out. That's a good thing. Look at the context of the Jesus/Caesar dialogue. He first says "who's image is on that coin?". On the response of "Caesar" he says to give Caesar what is Caesar's. He does not say give Caesar a percentage of your coins. He is basically saying...give Caesar all of his coins back. As in...stop using Caesar's money.What he probably wanted to say was..."stop using fiat currency and build a cryptocurrency that is decentralized so you do not need to use government money ever again".  Had he invested in bitcoin when he first started railing against it he could now take that money and donate it to his local communist party and probably get as much credibility among them as all of the propaganda he has put out over the past 4 years.
That is unfortunate. When everyone is poor, they are easily swayed by those that promise to drain the rich to give them money. Which makes them more poor in a never ending cycle of decay.What's worse is that even with a collapse, the people have already been infected by the idea that socialism is a good thing and in a democracy the people choose their new leaders. I have been to Romania where they lived under Soviet control for a whole generation. The young people are open to the free market but they have to wait as the old generation dies off before they can move forward. What makes sex NOT rape?Consent.What makes employment NOT slavery?Consent.What makes a transaction NOT a robbery?Consent.What makes a visit NOT an invasion?Consent.What makes a boxing match NOT assault?Consent.What makes taxation NOT theft?Magical fairy dust. Outside of Brazil we are all given propaganda that one side or the other want us to hear. From what I see they got rid of a corrupt socialist leader and elected a pro business leadership. Usually when I see pro socialist news attacking something it is usually a good thing. I have some hope for the new leaders to turn things away from the bad road it was going down. I had several Brasilian friends and girlfriend in Germany. They love the culture but do not want to go back mainly due to how unsafe and corrupt it is. There are several South American countries. A 1000+% inflation rate is a good exit sign. If I lived in Venezuela and could leave I would. I am sure that the medical industry probably hates fixing broken legs. No recurring money in that.They don't want cures, they want solutions that require your recurring payments. Drugs for the rest of your life, vaccines you need to renew every few years, etc. That is likely a per-country call. I live in South Korea so the first confrontation between North Korea/South Korea(US) that is likely to trigger a war will be followed by my logging into cheapair.com and find the first flight out of here.If I was in the US, things like passing laws that would likely trigger an event or the debt bubble finally pops, or something happens where energy is disrupted. Any war with Russia or any country who can actually hit things with their bombs is an exit event.Though my line in the sand that made me leave the US was the tax on being alive (Obamacare). If our government were funded by mass murder and rape, would you then justify it saying "mass murder and rape are the price we pay to live in a civilized society"? We gotta have government right? "There's nothing wrong with mass murder and rape, the only problem are those corrupt politicians that abuses the mass murder and rape for there personal interest. That's why we must put right persons over the government to avoid misuse of such government mass murder and rape." B...b...but...the pharmaceutical industry would never lie to us! They're doctors. They swear not to hurt us!Just because billions upon billions of dollars is at stake. Money has never encouraged anyone to push a false narrative ever in the history of the world.  I checked bitrefill to add data to my cell phone but it says Korea is not supported.Is there any top up service in Korea that takes bitcoins? If the ice age happens we can just drive SUVs and cause global warming. Or whatever other lame things that are blamed for all of the warming going on.Global freezing is so 1970s. It was changed to global warming in the 80s, then because they were both wrong they changed the term to climate change in the 00s. Get with the times bra.So many different words for communism after the Soviet Union fell...it's hard to keep up.  The likelihood of a worldwide apocalyptic event is staggeringly small. What could possibly happen to make every nation in the world including small islands in the Pacific to lose power, food, water, energy, etc?A shtf event is more likely to hit one country ala Venezuela right now where Bitcoin is very useful. Or even a world war would leave small pockets of untouched nations that would welcome you and your bitcoins (your gold as well).My shtf plan is mobility. First sign of bad things coming and I find my next country to live in. And they all take bitcoin. Getting your money through theft is done by corrupt people. I took 5 of these through the airport in Dubai and was chosen for a random screening. Needless to say I had to explain what they were. It did not help that I had wrapped them in metalic duct tape to ensure that nobody opened them during my travels. Eventually I removed enough of the tape for them to see that it was just some metal plates.When I went through security in Vietnam I made sure to have a picture on my phone of them and explained it to the guard. He said "oh, Bitcoin!" and let me move along. I think this dump is from the guy in this thread that predicted 3000 in July. He is trying to save face for his erroneous prediction if it were to happen in June.  I do not know of him. Come to find out there are over 1000 special economic zones in the world. It is a good trend. You will pay your taxes either way. Otherwise men with guns will come and kidnap you. West Texas is very cheap. Plenty of land to be had. It's in middle of nowhere though but you'll be left alone. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. There will never be honest rulers. The Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos, Belize, Bermuda...all tax havens. Not too many ships rolling up attacking them for their freedoms.I am sure between the time of Phase 1 in a protected harbor of a nation state and Phase 3 out in international waters, the people actually living on the seasteads will figure out stuff that people right now on an Internet forum cannot even fathom.Imagine someone trying to explain Purse.io's business concept back in 2009.
So you're basically saying that seasteads will be such a great thing that people will be clamoring to get to one.Reminds me of the early days of Bitcoin when the Keynesians were saying that nobody will ever buy bitcoins because the value will keep rising. Pirates sound scary!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFxK7o74-kYCould even make a sport out of them...target practice. Though currently it is being spun as a "green technology" to appease the environmental mafia, the concept is similar to cryptocurrencies in that you can spin up your own "government" and let the best one win.We're just about to start Phase 1 which is building a prototype in a nation's protected harbor with limited autonomy. Phase 2 is moving 12nm outside of the nation's borders but still in fairly shallow waters and inside the nation's EEZ. The final phase, Phase 3 is an autonomous seastead 200nm from any nation in international waters. Basically creating a new floating nation. The first one will be like Bitcoin and grow bigger and better over time. While others will duplicate the technology and concept and build their own seasteads in various places around the world implementing their own concepts in the hopes that people will join them.One of the keys to the concept is that your home/platform is mobile. If you don't like the way things are being run you just float to another seastead that you do like. It allows for competing governments in an incubator type of fashion where something much better than our current governments will arrise due to the free market force of choice.One example given is that if the government of a seastead declared war with someone, they might be surprised to wake up in the morning to discover that all of their citizens floated away in middle of the night to form a new seastead.I spent a week in Tahiti last month at a conference with some very intelligent people who are working to bring the first seastead to French Polynesia. The president welcomed us and they are very open to giving us a special economic zone in one of their protected harbors. The company that was formed, Blue Frontiers, should be taking investors soon. I spoke with their finance guy and told him to contact me as soon as they are ready for investors. I also sat down with their crypto workgroup and was humbled by the amount of talent that team brings with it. We definitely want people to be able to use Bitcoin to invest and record property ownership on the blockchain. The legislation should go through around January, then things will take off from there.TL;DR Seasteading will allow for the decentralizing of nations the same way Bitcoin decentralizes currency. It is amazing the amount of major nations that Bitcoin has passed.I remember thinking it would be great for one of those small nations to adopt Bitcoin as their national currency. Had they done that back in 2011 they would be one of the top economies of the world. When I think Real Estate I think of a house that will sustain me for the rest of my life. That means off grid, ability to grow at least meager food, or some means of survival. For me that could be a sailboat with solar panels and a fishing pole or a ranch in Texas.Or a seastead   Update:I just used this site to pay my rent. It went very well. Though the landlord never confirmed that he received the payment, I just said to tell me if it doesn't go through. Uncle Sam appreciates your investment in weapons for ISIS with your tax dollars. I remember when the price shot up to 60 dollars when I had bought at 20, all my friends at work were saying I should sell. Calling me crazy for not selling as it went over 100.I will diversify into Seasteading later this year as I see that as the next world changing technology that I believe in. I understand that the rise in price is due to many fiat lovers trying to get more fiat but that's just not me. Bitcoin is the superior currency. It will do more to help the world than anything else being worked on right now. Profit in what? A currency that will likely go away in the next 10 years due to a debt bubble and more wars?I stay at work mainly because it allows me to continue my high risk investment without worry of starving if it goes to zero. If I were to quit I would buy real estate or something that will sustain me for decades. Many here would likely justify murder if it was spun as good for the community (oh wait, they already do that...war, death penalty, etc).Can we all agree that the initiation of force or fraud is bad? No matter how many rainbows it results in. It is very demotivating for me to come into work when in one day I made more money than almost 2 years salary.Fortunately it's government work so I don't have to do much. And my boss is nice and I have respect for the people in my company (CEO is an old friend).  Now.Probably down to $1. But I will buy your bitcoins for $2. Don't blame theft. Theft was started for a good purpose. It is just being abused. Over $2900 on Bitstamp.Boom.gif (densel version) You crazy kids and your buying and hodling. This is pretty insane. Anyone who complains about how slow Bitcoin is just reveals that they do not spend bitcoins.Slow how? Takes a while to confirm when sending to the exchange to get your precious gov money?Paid for 4 things with bitcoins in the last day (including my Korean rent) and the transaction speed was seconds. About the amount of time to see the "sent" message on my phone to then check the web page to see that the transaction was detected. Booking my 4th of July vacation. A 10% rise in a day usually has a correction  A charity uses their money to do good things. Governments sometimes use their money to do good things.The question is not about what is done with the money but how it is obtained.The question posed is not "can money be used in a useful way?". Start another thread if that is what you want to discuss. Well that escalated quickly.
 A tale of 3 charts. The US has outlaws gold before, don't think they wouldn't do it again.Or worse...they outlaw tungsten then all the gold holders are going down. How about https://www.bitwire.co/It says you can send money to a Korean bank account. Simple. You live in a house owned by the bank and you pay them an insane amount of interest. RocketTrain.gif Happened. Stamp over 2300 now. You can't feel free from the financing of wars. Even if you don't pay tax on your income, you may still acquire food and other goods with which the seller has to pay tax. The money you give him in person. The government will always find a way to get into your pocket.[/quote]Yep. But if more people stop paying taxes and using the USD it will eventually shut down the machine. It is still theft.And yes, you are also somewhat responsible if you know that he will use the money to kill and yet you still allow him to have your money.That is why I left the US. The first tax day that came along where I paid no income taxes I felt relieved that none of my money went to fund ISIS. And by not holding dollars I was not contributing to the monetary system that allows them to print their war money. It is a very satisfying feeling. If a thief steals your wallet then gives the money to his sick mother...is it still theft? Boom.gifI look forward to using Rootstock on Bitcoin.The caveat being that their initial implementation will be slightly centralized due to a token being required and it will rely on several trusted actors to convert back and forth to bitcoins. This will change once Bitcoin gets upgraded with the code necessary to implement it in a decentralized way. And you are just one person thinking of better ways of funding things. Imagine if government stopped taking money without consent and many solutions could be put forth from thousands of great minds. Perhaps you missed the part where I said I wanted free education for all. Yes. I would also love some high technology smart roads that charge our cars as we drive and navigate for us. Free cars for everyone would be great too.But that does not negate the fact that the government is taking peoples' money without their consent. Let's address this morally outdated approach of funding things first. Then figure out all of the free stuff we both want people to have. The answer from the theft sympathisers is always "look at all the wonderful things you get from those tax dollars".They will always spin the conversation away from the fact that the money was taken without consent.I will flatly say, I want free education for all. I want everyone to have food. I want everyone to have free clothing and housing. That would be wonderful. But that's not what we were talking about was it? We were talking about our current ancient system of getting funds which involves one party forcefully taking from another party without their consent. Until that is fixed then there is no reason to talk about the free ponies and rainbows. I don't just carry my cryptosteel around with me when I travel. I was moving from one country to another so I brought with me the most valueable stuff (I have 2 suitcases sitting in a storage space in Afghanistan waiting for my buddies to get around to shipping them to me). I have 2 separate backups that I was able to leave with family (split amongs several members) when I was in the US.And I did mix the keys up so they are in the raw form but only I know the pattern.I would not rely on SD card as that can get corrupted or burned or fried. I do not keep all of my bitcoins in one address so memorizing each one would be faulty.Hopefully I will only be moving to a new country a few more times and I can securely hide my cryptosteel on my property.Which, like I said, I would be able to store gold once settled somewhere. But Bitcoin is a ton more easy to transfer country to country than several pounds of gold bars. With all of the tungsten they are using to core gold bars the supply will eventually run out. Buy tungsten now!!! (or gold bars since they are the same thing) Never really understood the reason behind early ultrasound scans. If your baby's head is misshaped or something, what could you possibly do to change anything? QFT Actually I buy just about everything online on Amazon with bitcoins that is sent to my Army post office box. And I get everything at a 15% discount thanks to bitcoin.The only reason I needed won was that I am renting an apartment and need 3 months rent upfront. In Europe I would use Bitwala to pay that with bitcoins but I am still learning the Korean bitcoin world and will likely not need won very much once I figure things out. Try having one currency and getting a large amount into another currency through the bank.
I just sold some bitcoins yesterday via localbitcoins. I raised the fee from .0006 to .001 for faster transaction which upped the fee to $2.20. At the regular rate that would be about $1.35.And that was buying 6 million won (about $5,500). Try getting $5,500 out of your ATM for $2.20.In the non-bitcoin world I would need to get a bank account on base (a very unfriendly bank), withdraw the cash and go to a local exchange that would charge me 4-5%. Like I said...way too much faith in the ability of "the govt" to accomplish anything.I happen to have worked for the government for the past 20 years. The amount of incompetence inherent in the system is astounding. The only way I survive is by making a game of seeing if I can be surprised by the stupidity of the day that comes from anyone with any power. I am fortunate to be given a gift that keeps on giving. Every reason you give for not liking Bitcoin tends to be based on some powerful government being able to methodically to stamp it out in some way or another. I've come to accept that you put far too much faith in centralized organizations to act intelligently and accomplish what they want to accomplish.If the central powers were as good as you give them credit for, we would have never needed Bitcoin in the first place. I am not hodling because of the belief of continuous increase in its price. I hodl because...well, what else would I buy with my bitcoins? Certainly not dollars which have the built in functionality of losing value over time on purpose. Which everyone accepts as ok. Agreed. Looking forward I see a debt bubble in many nations popping.I am avoiding it.With bitcoins. mini-month long bubble return to the mean Hey gang, sold all at $1850. When do you think it will hit $500 again? This may very well be the final bubble. Previous bubbles doubled 6 times, 5 times, then 4 times, and for some reason this time it only doubled once. I was expecting 3.The end to bubbles is a good thing though.The "return to mean" is over $1700 which I feel is still a decent price. Is cryptography done? You're crazy! Weekend crash! We're all gonna die! Posting steemit links makes him money. Crypto money. I was warned to diversify back in 2010 by old system investors.Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.-Warren Buffett  Was just looking into it as a like-kind exchange (IRS section 1031). Doesn't look very promising.If someone got my cryptosteel they wouldn't be able to get the key without knowing the order I put the key in. I still get paranoid about someone getting it and figuring out my pattern. I have a few different backups.I will likely diversify once I settle down somewhere. Crypto is ideal for mobility. I should be able to buy some seasteading real estate/stock in the next year. I'm thinking that might be the next big investment.What I won't do is ever let my gains be taxed. I hate funding ISIS with my tax dollars. I just recently moved to Korea and was wondering if there is any service available for paying Korean bills with bitcoins. Or some sort of bank transfer. I don't see much problem with it (other than a perhaps over hyped paranoia of how powerful governments are at manipulating commodity prices). You prefer gold and silver. They are decent and historically fairly stable. A pretty safe investment. I do not discourage buying gold or silver. I was actually looking at some gold websites to see if that could be a "like-kind" transfer of my bitcoins if the price skyrockets in bubble fashion and I want to move out for a few months without tax implications.However, how would I sell my gold back for bitcoins? Where would I store my gold? How can I move it to a new country?As time has gone on I have realized that we spend a lot of money on protecting our property. We pay police, state governments, national armies to protect our property. Gold requires spending money either through taxes spent on a safe place to live where you can store your gold. It is a constant cost to keep people from taking your wealth.Bitcoin does not have this cost. No government is required to protect my string of digits and letters. I can hold my wealth without needing a safe, home security system, local police department, national military, etc.For some of my bitcoins I recently purchased some crypto-steel and stored some bitcoins on those. I just moved from Afghanistan to Korea spending a few weeks in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and French Polynesia. By moving, that meant bringing my crypto-steel with me (not trusting it to some post office). So here I am traveling with these metal squares through various security. I spent about 15 minutes in Dubai trying to explain my crypto-steel to security (I had them wrapped in metalic tape to ensure nobody tampered with them). I finally had to unwrap one enough to show what was inside (I also had full chemical gear so that was part of the inquisition as well....long story). I ended up checking my bag in with the crypto-steel from there on out and was paranoid every minute that they were not in my possession. Every hotel I went to had to have a safe. I ended up in one hotel without a safe and I only left briefly to eat. I ended up using a bus instead of going on airplanes when I traveled due to the difficulty. Flying from Vietnam to French Polynesia I decided to keep the crypto-steel with me to avoid the worry I had before. I had to explain to a Vietnamese security guard what they were, I used pictures on my phone and was ok after 5 minutes (I was surprised when he said "oh, Bitcoin!").If I had as much money as I have in bitcoins, in gold I would be carrying around 100lbs(may be way off) in gold from country to country. I can't imagine being mobile with gold.For most people the cost of protecting your gold is already built into your lifestyle/taxes/home costs. For them, gold is a solid choice. Bitcoin has its place in the future economy and will be the choice for many people down the road, I don't see it as an all or nothing deal. It does not have to be. Any reason why Bitfinex is lower than Stamp? Did they clear up their withdrawal issues? Or are people just confident that it will be fixed? They had a movie that they took to a few Indy film fests. The end. Every dip is likely early adopters cashing out their huge stash. The more that happens the less big holders to dip the price in the future. The closer we get to most people only having around 1 bitcoin instead of a few people having thousands. The price holding here for a while with no big impending crash would be quite lovely.
If it is found out later that you lied when claiming your assets during a divorce you'll face criminal charges. Awesome. Sign me up for the government that is so good I would voluntarily pay for their services. And it would be so awesome that they would not need to use extortion to get you to pay.Where is this magical fairy land? I saw it as well. Didn't want to say anything publicly to jinx it but you guys caught it.October 2013 the price was $125 at the start. It doubled in a month to $250 in 2 weeks it was up to $500 a week later it doubled to $1000 then had the ATH within a few days before crashing.So look at $1250 as our start. We have doubled in a month. Top could be as high as $12,500. Benefits that someone would voluntarily pay for? $2,300?You kids are crazy. Bitcoin buyin crazy fools! Tahiti has not had a hurricane or cyclone in over 100 years. The closer you are to the equator the less those things happen.We would initially be under French Polynesia law protections. Nice. I just moved to Korea. Now I just need a Korean bank account. No, taxation is not theft.Technically it is extortion.Theft is the forced taking. They do not take it forcefully. They threaten you with the use of force unless you hand them your money. Which is extortion. If you do not believe that you are already living in a world of survival of the fittest you are looking at the world wrong. Those with the weapons run things. Look around.Why would you care if there is someone somewhere in the world that is free? I imagine if there was someone deep in a cave somewhere practicing freedom you would want to stop this "part of society" from exercising such freedom. Track them down and make them conform. Otherwise what? You couldn't live with yourself knowing that someone else is more free than everyone else? This price is just crazy.Lovin it though. Last year I said that if bitcoin hit $2k I would stand up at work and walk out.Of course, I just took a job for a friend of mine who I respect so I will give him 6 months. I just finished up a week in Tahiti for the first ever Tahitia seasteading conference.The takeaway is that French Polynesia supports us building the first ever seastead in one of their protected lagoons. They are willing to set up a Special Economic Zone for the seastead that will allow us to have our own economic laws but still require following their criminal laws. So things such as taxes, labor laws, business regulation etc will be handled by us, things such as murder, rape, theft etc will be handled under the current French system. And of course, defense against pirates will fall under the French navy's responsibility.The legislation should go through by the end of 2017 and then 2018 we can get started. Likely first seastead will be up in 2020.I will be working with a great team of cryptocurrency experts to see how we can integrate Bitcoin and blockchain technology for things such as title management, equity investments, shares, etc. Strangely enough, as high as bitcoin goes I still look for a reasonable car under $5k that will last a few years with low maintenance.Though I spent more than that in the last week on a vacation. Pulled out my bitcoin app and it was defaulted to Kraken. I noticed the price high was $2589. Some crazy anomoly from the looks of it. Pirates? We don't develop near nations where pirating is common. If any project starts out with "we have to be able to defend ourselves against nations" then it's dead from the start. Imagine if everyone considering buying a boat thought "I can't buy this boat, Korea may attack me". I am currently in Tahiti for a seasteading conference. Should be interesting. Spent the last few weeks scoping out Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Thailand seems like it has good potential. Exactly. I was asked once why I vaccinate my dogs and not myself. Other than most facilities require proof of vaccines, if my dog turns into an idiot it only makes him cute. It doesn't fuck up his entire ability to fend for himself in the future. I have only told friends and family twice that they should buy. Once in 2010 when the price was $17 and in 2015 when the price dropped to $220.They ignored me in 2010. One sister bought 1 bitcoin at 220.She kept spending half of it on trips every time it doubled. She liked how she could spend half and still keep her original investment.I don't recommend buying bitcoin to anyone but those I care about. For everyone else, if they don't get it they can die off with the rest of the sheep. Pro vaxxer: Vaccinations work!Pro vaxxer: don't infect me bro (even though supposedly vaccines work). And this is why we try to educate people.Today's opinions are so easily backed by the force of guns.
Been off the 'net a few days. Pulled up bitcoinity thinking $1600? $1400? Then I see $1788 and think all is right with the world.I also found out that in Tahiti, today is yesterday. Had to book a room in a hostel for a night. No Internet. No A/C. Extra day though 😃 Or that he made a mistake which can happen to anyone. But most doctors give you drugs to cure you... At least in my country xD[/quote]In the US doctors are just legal drug dealers. One of the biggest drugs pushed is Oxycontin which doesn't cure anything. It just gets you addicted. People also take medicine for every little thing. Medicine that does not cure what ails them. Only covers up the symptoms.Big pharma has taken over the world.The wool has been pulled over everyone's eyes.If your doctor gives you a drug that does not cure you, he is admitting that he is incompetent. lol...nice I sold some bitcoins.And by "sold" I mean, I booked a trip to Tahiti. With bitcoins. It is crazy how these little alts I bought now factor into my price checks.I even check on PPC which I bought just because I had some money left on btc-e Many medical professions are afraid of openly admitting that vaccines are not healthy. They get black balled and lose their jobs. I know of a few doctors (my brother is a Chiropractor who deals with this a lot) that do not vaccinate their children but do not tell anyone.The pharmacy industry is one of the most powerful i dustries in the world. You will comply. The price doesn't start going exponential until it has doubled in a month. As long as the pro-vaxxers don't infect me through laws with their health choices. Is this gentlemen? Having lived with an alcoholic that could not beat the addiction I did a lot of research on this. The best explaination I found goes something like this:Alcohol is literally a poison. When you drink it, you feel the effects of that poison working on your body. If you drink too much your body will try to defend itself by making you vomit out the poison.Not that big of a deal if done once in a while. Your body can handle it.The biggest problem comes when you drink alcohol while your body is still developing. Your body will do the usual thing of trying to keep you from poisoning yourself. You will puke, you will feel sick. But if you continue to drink while you are young your body will adapt. Because you continue to injest this poison your body figures it will be a common thing so it changes your body to compensate. It will literally change your body chemistry so that alcohol is not only expected, but required. Your body changes to treat alcohol as a necessity. Going without alcohol triggers reactions in your body that make you want to drink in the same way that not eating food triggers your body to react making you want food.And it just gets worse over time the more you drink. Maybe you can change your body chemistry over time but your body is no longer developing so there is not much reason for it to do so.So basically drinking heavily, often, when you are young will make you an alcoholic later in life. As for the occasional drink. Beer is actually fairly healthy, wine is also healthy. You can injest small amounts of poison without harming your body. Our bodies are fighting off bad things all day. But while your body is developing it should be avoided. And drinking to the point of puking should be avoided.Personally I plan on scaling back my drinking. I plan on trying to rid my body of unnessesary chemicals over time.I have learned that it is perfectly ok to go to a bar and order cranberry juice and still be able to enjoy the friends and atmosphere. I believe in God and I like the color blue. Those thoughts should have no affect on anyone else.Religions have been the cause of many problems mainly due to their ties to any sort of power used against people. Especially those religions closely intertwined with governments. The announcement was that they hired a third party to verify their holdings. As with any hardware you are trusting the manufacturer and everyone involved in creating it. We are fighting for our own health. Stricter and stricter laws are continuously passed to force vaccinations on those that do not want it.Can you see who benefits from pro-vaccination? Can you even consider that maybe...just maybe...all of the paid research and lobbying done benefits the pharmacy companies? Would it at least be fair to be allowed to sue if something goes wrong? For hardware wallet you need only keep a copy of the seed. What the shit fam indeed.Amazing....Amazing. Best way to fight disease is smoking cigarettes.Oh wait...we're onto another industry selling their miracle cures. But this time we have a whole booming industry that is protected from lawsuits. I was not vaccinated and I am grateful for being given the opportunity to have a healthy life.If I have children I will selfishly not vaccinate them so that they have a superior immune system compared to the other children. So sayeth the prophets.Atheism, science, government...they are all their own forms of religions with their priests/pastors, bishops, popes, scriptures, dogmas, along with their own ways of dealing with "sinners" that don't follow their commandments.
I'm liking whatever price Coinbase is using for bitcoin spending price.I bought a ticket to Tahiti for the Seasteading conference that came to $1641. My bitcoin cost was about .99 BTC. That dude will win a Pulitzer for that insightful news article. Have you ever spent bitcoins in the real world?Many websites require you to create an account and then send bitcoins to the website where they hold your bitcoins while you spend on their site. Purse.io does this, all of the gift card sites do this, most ATMs do this, Coinbase is trying to get all of their merchants to just use the user's Coinbase wallet, most gambling sites do this, all exchanges do this.It is common. At least for LN you would be able to open the channel for an amount of time you are comfortable with and you don't have to trust the website to leave with your money. And after that time, the bitcoins come back to you automatically. You don't have to remember down the road what websites you have money on. Gosh. Bitcoin is so boring today. The goal for my website: bitpools.com was to include a forum where people discussed various crowdfunding projects. Part of their profile was going to include the amount of bitcoins they had available to put toward the project.That way, if person X was of the opinion that the project should do one thing and person Y wanted to go another way, if person X displayed only .1 bitcoins and person Y displayed 100 people would find it more likely that the project would go down the path of Y's opinion.It would cut down on alt coin trolls too. For those new to Bitcoin. I am thinking the same thing. Bitfinex price had to rise and everyone followed.With Bitcoin finding the price point is difficult. Nobody knows what it is worth so you just go with the flow.The main thing to keep it from jumping to 1 million is that there are 12.5 BTC created every 10 minutes. There is at least some price limiter from miners.I believe that most miners are smart enough to hold off on selling during a rally. Though they have bills at the end of the month that they can only hold back on so long. Prediction:With the price increase people will start shouting from the rooftops about BU or Segwit scaring away all of the new adopters that thought Bitcoin was a good place for their money. Using FUD to make people belive that without their preffered upgrade, Bitcoin is doomed.Then the price will tank. I will likely buy some gold and silver once I settle in one place but I travel the world with all of my belongings.It was hard enough going through Dubai last week explaining what my Cryptosteel was to security (FYI my keys are scrambled in a way that only I know so even if someone stole it, they could not get my BTC).Gold requires money spent protecting it. Even if that just means owning property and spending money to hold that property.I believe Bitcoin has proven itself as a store of value. The only thing something needs to have value is for people to agree on that fact. That is why I will give it a year.Though if it climbs over and stays above $2k...it would take a very small straw at work to make me stand up and walk. Though I tend to be given a lot of leeway at work. Perhaps because they know I don't give a f. Well. I have reached my number. I retire in one year if the price holds above this level.By retire I mean leave my shitty job and pursue my dream of seasteading.And no. It does not mean I have reached my selling point. Bitcoin is my currency. All due respect Alexoz but the impression I get is that you bought a bunch of NMC because you missed out on the early BTC days. You want to pump the coin so that you can make big money. Like many people who invest in alt coins.I agree with biolizard89 that people starting to use NMC right now will get frustrated by how hard it is to use. I'm a software engineer and the few times I attempted to get things working it never resulted in being able to open a .bit website.Not that I spent a lot of time on it, but it's certainly not straightforward. Even going the easy route of adding an OpenDNS IP to my DNS didn't work.I invested a lot in NMC a few years ago because I believe in the concept and hope it succeeds. If I get to the point where I have a lot of extra time I would likely start contributing to the code. But I trust that the devs are doing what is best for Namecoin. I think the old timer traders figured out that buying and hodling are better in the long run. Those that traded probably lost a lot of money because the early traders were amateurs. There were only a hand full of semi-professional traders early on. I'm not sure if this is because people see that there are those on Bitfinex willing to pay a lot more for bitcoins and so they also believe they should pay a lot more on other exchanges.The correction will likely come when Bitfinex gets its withdrawals back up and running or they go under.As much as I like the rise in price, it certainly makes me nervous. If we held near this price for a month before slowly moving up again I would be quite pleased. Not much we can do about that. Looks like the price will never go above $1436.  I bought a few early alts that were not that big of a deal to me but they have risen to the point where I check on them almost daily.Though calculating it all, only one alt has done better than BTC and I would have been better off keeping them in BTC.(LTC, PPC, NMC and Mastercoin for full disclosure). Lingham literally means penis (phallus). Oh noooo!!!Bitcoin crashing. I guess the expiriment failed.   I'm sitting in Thailand waiting on paperwork for a job in Korea to finish. As the bitcoin price goes up it makes me reconsider going back to work.I just want to stay here and build seasteads. Hey gang. Has anyone noticed that the bitcoin price is up?Rockets & moonbeams
I hope this rise isn't based on the ETF. That ship has sailed. Over $1/NMC. Not to shabby. 3 year high I believe. Up $100 per week needs to be the new standard.Make it so! The price increase may be a reaction to this:*won't post the link because it's CoinDesk* When I check the Bitfinex charts I'm likethen I switch back to Bitstamp and I'm like I switch from the Bitstamp price on my bitcoin app to Bitfinex and think*ThatEscalatedQuickly.gif* I look forward to seeing Trump's supporters hailing him as a genius for lying to all of his suppprters to win the presidency. They will claim that they knew all along and were just going along with it for appearances sake. Because they, like Trump, really had something completely different in mind for his presidency. They will not reveal what that plan is until Trump executes it of course. But afterwards they will hail him as a great businessman that fooled everyone (except his supporters because they knew). Trump says the dollar is too strong.  LolI guess he hasn't noticed the dollar crashing against real money.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4406584/Trump-sends-dollar-plunging-comments-currency.html I will give a million dollars to anyone who can get the price of one bitcoin up to one million dollars for at least a day.*Make it so.This offer expires in one year. Must be on an exchange that I can cash out at least 100 bitcoins for a million dollars each. I was a gold bug before Bitcoin. My biggest thing was that I wanted it to replace the dollar. So I wanted to be able to use it for day to day purchases while holding it as it gained value over time as opposed to the dollar where loss of value is a built in feature.But when I looked into different ways of holding gold and spending it (like with a Visa card) it cost X amount of gold per month to store your gold and pay for auditing of the gold. And it cost a huge exchange rate per purchase. So it was definitely not practical to use as a primary currency. For store of value, sure.But for me, I travel all over the world with all of my possessions. There is no way I would carry gold around with me through airports. With Bitcoin I can have a string of characters encrypted somewhere on the cloud or written on a piece of paper in my shoe or however I want to have it when I travel. I can move with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins over borders without a care in the world.If I lived in a house with a secure safe, well hidden, then I would buy gold as a store of value. Not to use as a currency though. Certainly. There's no way to be sure. It's good to have your own price points in the bitcoin world otherwise you'll go crazy trying to figure things out. My trend line has done well for me so far.I also attributed much to the downward hype after 2 years of downward pricing. The way I see the price movement now is that there is an underlying upward trend line that has a much lower price but due to the price having gone up for so long people are expecting that the price will continue rising at a good pace and are more willing to invest. If the price had been going down for the past year the current price would be down below that trend line by quite a bit.With enough FUD to manage the expectations the price should continue going up at a reasonable pace no matter the news because the performance of the investment is so good.If irrational exuberance kicked in and everyone thought that the new dawn of cryptocurrency across the world was about to occur with exponential price rises then we would definitely crash down and head into a downward cycle where people are dropping out just because of the direction of the price.Having said that, my price point without the investment frenzy due to our current track record is about $900 currently. With that going up about $20 per month. I am not too hopeful that the price will go back down to there because by the time we get to another downward track record the underlying value (+$20 per month) would put us at current prices. The point is to demonstrate that someone can live on bitcoins. They can hold 100% bitcoins instead of other currencies and do just fine. I have done this so I know it can be done.There are many services that are helpful such as gift cards or a third party like purse.io, even BitPay is not direct bitcoin to the merchant. Trying to be all 100% and "pure" is just silly at this stage of Bitcoin. I gladly pay for my web hosting service even if they accept BitPay instead of me directly sending my bitcoin to the merchant's wallet.This is new to Japan so them getting the word out with stunts like this is just fine.It's better than the journalist in the US who tried it in the early days and when trying to get a subway ticket he stood outside of the station with a sign that said "will pay bitcoin for a ticket", when he could have gone online, used bitspend (at the time) to buy a subway ticket online. His conclusion: other than one or 2 niche stores, you can't use your bitcoins. I'm glad this experience wasn't one of those "no, I must only spend directly from Bitcoin to Bitcoin" types of deals that others have done only to conclude that Bitcoin is difficult to spend.Living on Bitcoin means having bitcoins and spending them. Even if you need to go through third party services.I imagine if someone were to do an experiment of "I'm only going to spend dollars" and use actual cash they would experience more limited options. Some places in the US do not accept cash anymore. The price jumped quickly to $1350 then came back down the day of the ETF. The wall at $1200 is about 1000 BTC.Huge walls like that tend to be manipulation in the direction of the wall. McCain loves war so much he armed and funded ISIS just so we could have someone to fight. New ATH coming this week. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a false flag. Trump's budget calls for a huge boost in military spending. He needs to be able to justify it while we reach a $20 trillion debt ceiling.I would also not be surprised if his son-in-law visiting Iraq a few days before the attack played a role. Watching the videos of kids who just got hit by gas I was wondering how in the hell the camera man was there so soon after the attack and why wasn't he helping the kid instead of filming him gasping for air.
True. I sent 4 transactions the other day with the minimum fee. First went through within the hour, the other three I kept checking before I finally went to sleep. Woke up and they still had 0 confirmations. Came home from work and finally they had started going through.I wasn't in any rush really, moving bitcoins to cold storage. But as someone who likes spending my bitcoins at places and for a lot of things, I hope things get better.Though, worst case scenario is that people stop moving bitcoins...which clears up transactions allowing people to move bitcoins...and then they stop moving bitcoins...etc... They catch people because of high electricity usage.Too bad they don't have Lightning Network yet, they could run a node and not worry about the police. My agenda is: Either way, as this is not the development forum I will return the thread to discussions of Bitcoin price movement tracking. Bitcoin price up over 12% since April 1. If we could do this every week that would be quite satisfactory. Source? The Eclair LN client (currently in alpha on the Testnet) looks as easy to use as early Bitcoin clients.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRzpr_QW_2w You mean, like every transaction is on a public ledger? LN is as private as the network you choose to join. The market will be able to provide the amount of privacy you need. I'm starting to notice the beginnings of Facebook censoring content that they do not agree with. While I know this has been going on for a while in niche ways, I have started seeing it myself now.I would love to switch over to Taringa and actually get paid in bitcoins for posting but their site is all in Spanish and I could not locate an English version.Are there any Facebook alternatives out there that will most likely take over as Facebook becomes more and more SJWish?I don't really like Facebook in the first place but where I work they block most websites and I can waste my time on there and have simple communication with all of my family on there. I just want to be able to run a LN node and make money from my CPU and network connection.Kinda like what was promised by a certain cryptocurrency back in the day. I don't really care which upgrade goes through as long as it goes smoothly (though I would really like to see Lightning Network go through) but seeing Litecoin double in price due to the likelihood of Segwit going through makes me want to see the same thing happen to bitcoin's price.Make it so. Fair enough. Most likely anyone arrested was arrested for something else but it was reported to sound like they were arrested for using bitcoins. Bitcoin is alive and well in Thailand. I was in Vietnam where people talk about it being illegal and I was able to use my first Bitcoin ATM right in middle of the city. Do not ever believe it when a news article states that a country has banned Bitcoin. Most people do not verify it because they do not speak the native language.Every time I have checked into one of these "X country just banned Bitcoin!", it is usually the central bank making a statement that they will not allow Bitcoin on their system. It's like saying that Burger King burgers are banned because the CEO of McDonalds releases a statement saying that no Burger King burgers will be sold by McDonalds. Then McDonalds goes on to warn about the risk you are taking by eating a Burger King burger.Sure, some central banks have a tighter hold on their country's government than others but there is never a ban. If you go on localbitcoins you can buy/sell in every country in the world except Germany. And that is only because Germany declared Bitcoin a "private money". But in so doing, they tied all of their regulations to money to Bitcoin which included having a license to run an exchange (and they considered localbitcoins an exchange). On the bubble chart, I would say we are in the "return to mean" phase of our tiny bubble we had.This is encouraging as I think any future "bubbles" (as Bitcoin tends to have) will be less and less severe as to completely phase out altogether. The reason Litecoin went up because they will likely start trading on Coinbase soon.The LTC price has been about $4 for about 4 years now with only minor fluctuations now and then. They are probably more stable compared to the dollar than most currencies in the world yet the naysayers would probably make up some other excuse as to why nobody should use it (like how people say Bitcoin can never be used because the price fluctuates too much...yet bitcoin is used much more than litecoin).*disclaimer: I may or may not have 1k litecoins on a computer somewhere Strange. I never posted that. Bitcoin be like: That is unfortunate. Thank you for the info.I can see the eventuality that we will some day have 95% use of the new Core wallet but even the few stragglers plus the disgruntled will easily be able to keep it under 95% by November.Hopefully LN can work toward code that does not require Segwit even though I know it is much more complicated. Ok, I really hate to ask here since I hate blocksize debate in this thread but this would affect price projections.When Segwit was released, wasn't there a time limit of one year to reach 95% put on it? Or am I quite confused? If not, what is the date?Also, here is an awesome video of a LN client being tested:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68npliVCWwI want to set up a LN node right now! I would say that we experienced a mini-bubble over the past few months and we are now climbing out of the mini despair phase. Back to the mean. Most people who have been around for a while know that this thread has absolutely zero impact on the price. I think some of us thought it did in the early (<$10) days but it is no longer the case.The few whales that frequent this thread are either long term hodlers, or play a hold/loan on bitfinex strategy.You can let fly your trading strategy here all you want. Nobody will change their buys or sells based on any posts in this thread other than the occasional quick turnaround on news dissemination here due to everyone having an interest in the bitcoin price and things that affect it.
Even though it is a long way off, I can see the halving of 2020 doing the same thing to the price it did this year. If we don't have any down years between now and then I could easily see $5-10k going into early 2021.That is why little dips here and there are just more opportunity to buy. Wow, about 15 pages added to the thread since I left last night.Without looking I would guess that they were all filled with blocksize spammers. I'm starting to truly believe that about 85% of the blocksize debate spammers here and on reddit are just alt coin shills hoping to spread FUD and get cheap bitcoins. I was being sarcastic.Every thread on the Internet about Bitcoin these days is just people bitching about Segwit and BU.Even in a thread that is supposed to be focused on Bitcoin price movement tracking and discussion.            Take it to the development section assholes. That is where Bitcoin development should be discussed. It is very difficult to find anyone that will discuss BU or Segwit. I wish there was more discussion about it but nobody has an opinion for one or the other. If only this were another year long downtrend. I just got another job out here in Afghanistan making about $50k more. I have 2 years of buying ahead of me.I stopped buying when the price passed $800. I have about 5 months of paychecks accumulated to dump back in if the price becomes stupid low. Hmm...this is how shills are born. Sell low, buy alts high, then try to recover your losses by trying to get everyone else to buy your alt with the hopes of breaking even and selling. Hey gang. I heard someone mention something about blocksize and Bitcoin.Does anyone here have an opinion on this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY Someone mentioned it was added to some sort of alt19 fund of alts. Or something like that.I just wish I could add a plugin to my browser to start accessing .bit domains. Something as simple as that.People look up Bitcoin address balances on blockchain.info, why would it be difficult to do the same for .bit IP addresses the same way? Then map it to a plugin. Nah, most of my wealth has come from working 12 hour days, 7 days a week, 365 days a year in a war zone. Bitcoin has just increased that wealth and been a good way to protect it from losing value. Amazon is one of the best use cases of Bitcoin.Why would you want Amazon to accept bitcoins when you can buy anything on Amazon at a discount using bitcoins?You can also buy anything on eBay at 3% off via Gyft, egifter, etc. If you have to keep your money in a currency that is specifically created to lose value as a feature, you're doing it wrong. Hopping back and forth between currencies is the source of most problems when it comes to crypto. I will plant this money tree and become rich.

What happens when my Trezor dies down the road and the company that creates them no longer exists? Is there a way to recover my bitcoins from the seed in such a case? I'm not very sold on the whole hardware wallet concept. Especially after my Case wallet didn't work as I had hoped. I have the seed but am not sure how I would get my bitcoin back.I have always relied upon just storing the full private key (mixed in a way that only I know). I bought a few of these:I am quite impressed.Dude tries to destroy one:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1hLFsBuDT0I verified that the private keys were legit on a cheap laptop that I never connected to the Internet. I then pulled the hard drive and destroyed it down to tiny pieces. I will be burning the rest of the laptop in a fire just to be sure.I also bought a Case hardware wallet.I am not so sure about this one. I put 1 bitcoin on it last year, checked it later and never saw the bitcoin. http://www.coindesk.com/one-bitcoins-biggest-funds-selling-ahead-etf-decision/ The next thing to move the price will be when China starts allowing Bitcoin withdrawals.Not that the price needs much help in moving.
Just had someone try to log into my ANX Pro exchange account. That site used the Cloudflare thing that was hacked a few weeks ago. Just FYI.They didn't get in, I don't have anything on any exchanges anymore anyway. All cold storage at this point.IP address was India though that is likely spoofed. One of the critiques was from Professor Bitcorn stating that 50% of bitcoins are owned by less than 1000 people. Mark Zuckerburg alone owns almost 30% of Facebook and yet they are just fine with listing his little fund. Many companies list their stocks on the exchanges with most of the ownership belonging to two or three people.And that high percentage number goes down over time as we all see the early adopters dump a large amount of their coins periodically.I am willing to bet that they do not hold all future ETFs to such a high standard. I would be willing to write to the SEC during any open request for comments to ask if the new ETF fulfills all of the requirements that they rejected Bitcoin for. In the end, Bitcoin will be around long beyond the SEC and the US government. I find it strange that they did not accept the ETF because they could not regulate every bit of it.How do they regulate all of the gold in the world for the GLD ETF? So, I just woke up. Did I miss anything?I see the price is down 1% from yesterday. Is Bitcoin done? I am home    I sold my house in the US last year. I'm an expat. The world is my home.I have a price point that I am working toward, when I hit that number (or the bitcoin price hits that number) I will book a flight and leave. Probably go live in Asia or French Polynesia.(I am planning on staying out here for 2 more years) $0$0$1241 lol...ya, no thank youI live on base, I never leave the gates. There's really no reason to have money here anyway. Everything is provided for you. I just took the price of 1 bitcoin and put that amount in the calculator on the website. It gave the percentage.Then I took the price of 100 and plugged it in.Then I plugged in different numbers until I found out what the top 1% had. Then I divided by the bitcoin price.At $1241 for one bitcoin that would put you in the top 66% richest people in the world. Nice. Not so exciting. My office looks more like this:(not my actual work site)I do computer things. In Afghanistan. I wouldn't know what to exit into. I certainly do not want to buy dollars. How much longer can that ponzi scheme go on? Why does everyone think you only need skills on the Internet to make money?Can you wash dishes? Can you scrub floors? That's a way to make bitcoins also. I would hope most people know how to do such things. My life savings is in bitcoins but that is nothing new. An approval pushing the price up over $3k would mean I would retire sooner rather than later. A rejection means a few more years of buying many more bitcoins.Not retire in the sense of no longer working...just working on something I want instead of living in a war zone working in a box. Yes. But a centralized platform in the Bitcoin world is certainly vulnerable. Someone might do it just for the lolz. Not a conspiracy. I just work for the government and know that usually on a Friday people take off early. I think it's more the fact that if it is approved, more people will be buying.The reality is that many of those people that actually have bitcoins will sell if the price jumps up a lot. Someone has to supply bitcoins to the Wall Street folks. Who wants to bet that the sec.gov website gets DDoS attacked today? Being the government and it being a Friday, I would expect the announcement to be before 4PM EST.  That was extended. No specific extension date though. That's why the price was down about $100 the past few days. 
More like the many people who say "I have no skills or knowledge so signature campaigns are the only way I can get bitcoins".I wonder how these people survive day to day. Or how they survived before bitcointalk. A possible scenario is that someone found out the ETF was going to be denied.They bought a shitload of bitcoins to drive the price up to $1350 then shorted the shit out of it driving it down to $1180. This resulted in a bunch of people assuming the ETF was approved which drove the price up. Maybe the IT guy told to input the announcement onto the SEC website   Apparently 90% of the people in this thread do not have jobs. The only way they can make money is through signature campaigns.Judging from this thread, the world unemployment rate is 90%. Surprising from a group of people who can read and write English and have access to the Internet. I thought so too. Do you have an island picked out yet? There is nothing in the SEC rules stating that a rule change cannot fall on the weekend. It states that for other things, but not for a rule change. If nothing happens Friday, the rule change is approved.But then we would need to wait for the ETF to be approved. Also, it was wings Wednesday at the chow hall. You just need to read the words I quoted. Wait, what? Why would you sell when your good friend sent you a screenshot of the press release set for Wednesday? I ended up using giftoff.com/gift-cards/skypeBut if egifter has cards now I would likely use them as I have used them several times in the past. The cost for the steel required for my initial prototype would be less than $10k. For me that is not cost prohibitive.  Yes. Concrete is the cheapest and most resilient material against salt water. Most seasteaders choose that as their material. I am fairly certain that The Seasteading Institute plans on creating huge 50 meters platforms out of concrete. Concrete hulled pontoon boats would be good if they are separate from each other. But concrete is fragile when it bangs against concrete over and over. It would be very difficult to attach them together for a large platform. Anything that would be flexible and strong enough to separate the units would likely degrade in salt water over time.Steel has been used for ship building for decades. It can also bang against each other over and over without degradation. Also, polyurea adheres best to steel, which is what I would use for coating to protect from salt water.I address the reason for steel in my design outline: https://discuss.seasteading.org/t/my-viva-vivas-seastead-design/921/2 Initially it would be no different than living on a sailboat moored out in the water. You order your parts on Amazon, have it shipped to an address at a harbor address or marina, you take a dingy to the marina and get your supplies.With many people on the seasteads, there will likely be someone going back and forth almost daily. It would likely be commonplace for people to pick up someone else's mail. As a libertarian I have my own ideas of governance but considering the first seastead will be within the waters of a nation, there is not much point in deciding now with people who don't actually live on the seastead. I would leave such things to be determined by those who actually take the action of uprooting their lives and live on the seastead. They would know best how things should be run. The initial governance would be under the host nation's governance.  It is interesting, I live overseas and hardly ever see chemtrails. When I saw a picture my brother posted back in the US and saw the sky I was surprised by the amount in the sky. I am still not entirely convinced but such things give me pause. I would say that it likely has more to do with the amount of planes in the sky. Being in Afghanistan there are no planes flying over.Higher concentrations of nitrogen in the water may be a good thing for some of the algae farms, benefiting the seastead. Such proposals have been made to actually help curb water pollution.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN0WF6gNbcA Typhoons and hurricanes do not exist on the equator.
I just thought I would post a thread here as I have an interest in Bitcoin and seasteading. For those that have never heard of it, seasteading is taking the concept of homesteading to the ocean. If your floating home is 12 nautical miles away from a nation's shore, you are not subject to most of the nation's laws outside of mineral rights, oil, and a few other things. 200 nautical miles from any nation and there is are no national laws.The idea pushed by the Seasteading Institute is that if we set up several of these seastead communities, we can experiment with new forms of government which can rise or fall based upon how good the new government works. With current governments there is not much competition. With thousands of seasteads competing for residents that can pick up and move to a new seastead, there will be innovation in government.A sound idea also pushed and generally accepted is that the first seasteads will likely be protected by a host nation initially so that we can work through the engineering constraints first before moving further and further out to sea. The Seasteading Institute has partnered with French Polynesia to begin building the world's first seastead in the protected waters of one of their larger islands. The hope is that they will begin building a large structure some time in 2019. Cost estimates for the initial structure have been somewhere in the $30-$50 million range, with each person needing about $500k to $1 million to live there.My own plan, which is a slight deviation from their plan, is to start small and modularly (not likely a real word). I would also like to start in a protected waterway initially. But I recognize that most people cannot afford such a high price, and their system does not leave much room for picking up your home and floating to a new seastead if you want to. My goal is to follow the tiny house trend initially and build a small modular floating structure that I can keep under $20k for the base price (plus cost of solar panels, water maker, composting toilet, etc.). Basically enough living space as a small boat, but unlike a boat you can attach these units together for more and more living space as can be afforded.The rise in the bitcoin price has accelerated my plans and at a certain price point I will likely quit my job and pursue this full time. I am not here looking for funding, investment or even a hand out. I have been working on my design for several years now. I have created computer models of it and will focus next on finding the most structurally sound design as possible while keeping it economical. My initial plan will be to move to a low cost country, likely in Asia (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc.), maybe French Polynesia (more expensive), and work on building my prototype. I will then move it to the ocean and test in a protected waterway, living in the smallest unit to learn and improve the design. I will be doing this no matter what. I will share my journey with those that are interested and I hope that once I have something proven, people will want to join my journey and become pioneers in this new industry.A good forum where seasteading is discussed in grave detail can be found here: https://discuss.seasteading.org/Do not presume to think that I have not considered some obvious thing about living on the ocean or building a seastead or some knee jerk reaction such as waves or pirates. If you go to the seasteading forum you will see that there have been discussions on there back as far as 2008 (when I first got involved) and there is discussion (mostly arguments) about just about every minute detail that may come up. Mostly discussions about things that do not need to be considered until we are 200 nm from any nation.What are your thoughts on seasteading? Is it something you would consider doing at some point in your life? What do you like/not like about the concept?Here is a high level overview of my design that I put together a few years ago. I have since improved upon that initial design but the concept is still similar.https://discuss.seasteading.org/t/my-viva-vivas-seastead-design/921/2  Bold claim sir.The rule change has to take place, then the ETF has to be passed. But they can both be approved at the same time.I would not be surprised if this happens. I hope it does and the price jumps (and holds) over $3k.Also: Do not be surprised if the Winklevoss twins announce that the ETF will open up later this year. Being accepted does not mean hedge fund money will start flowing in that same day.   Seems like every time that thing shows up the price goes down.  We'll see corrections all the way up. It's healthy. Early adopters need to distribute their bitcoins to many new users. $1.25 million buy wall on Stamp.Such manipulation will likely be followed by a correction.Back down to $1100 or so for a few days. Get those buy orders ready. I did. I am enjoying this rise.I recently found out the contract I am on here in Afghanistan is going away in a month or so. I had originally planned on working out here 2 years and quitting to develop seasteads. I am seriously considering starting a lot earlier. The last all time high in 2013 I did not see any reason why it would not again reach that price. So I spent those years accumulating as many bitcoins as I could.I would think the same if it dropped again.   You're right. Deflationary.  Ok, maybe a little lower. With chart. If you look at the lines from that last two huge drops, the line would be at $1128 as the floor.Sorry, no charts. Everyone always talks about how the pizza guy or anyone else from early on is super rich and can buy an island.But if you notice many times during these run ups, from $1 to $32, $10 to $266, $125 to $1216, $800 to $1220...there are always some huge dumps all at once on the way up.That's just another early adopter dumping their bitcoins on the market to sell out to the world of fiat. Whoever had 10,000 bitcoins back then have likely sold it. Hell, maybe they sold them all when the price reached $1 and considered it a great investment.Bitcoin is a depreciating currency. It will always go up. I like how last month's rise in price, according to the MSM, was "Chinese are moving money out of China through Bitcoin". Just a month later it's because of the ETF. Because a month ago we didn't know about the ETF. Also, Japan and India. Looks like the attempt to pass the 3 year high on BitStamp of $1139 was a bit too soon as today's run up was already on its final legs by the time it reached $1130.Though if cup and handle charts work out, it looks like if we pass that price in the next few days we will be seeing a quick spike in the price. The more mature the Bitcoin currency becomes, the less wild swings we will have. Not jumping 10X-50X is a good thing.
The longer we go without a decision the more likely the ETF passes. If no decision is made by March 11, then the rule change is automatically approved.One of the most likely things that people do when faced with a tough decision is to do nothing. Thanks for the input.Bitcoin will be around for centuries. I am sure there will be many features added whether it is big blocks, sidechains, sidechains with big blocks, lightning network, quantum network, whichever. It will only grow over time.  I don't usually jump into the block size debate because even though I am a software engineer, I have not been developing Bitcoin so I don't really see it as my place and leave that to those that are actually getting their hands dirty. But hey, at least I am posting in the correct forum for this question.From what I understand, Bitcoin unlimited is basically an upgrade that allows miners to increase the block size. Segwit is a way of moving a large chunk of the block off of the blockchain.What is incompatible between these two features and why can they not both be implemented?Why not BU, Segwit, sidechains and lightning network?Is it just a power play thing? Or are there technical reasons?Also, please do not attack me if you see this as an attack on "your side". I know this has become a religious discussion. Please keep it technical. Using http://www.purse.io you get 15% off of any Amazon purchase. Better than perfect.There's really no advantage to Amazon accepting bitcoins at this point. Amazon.As for the price, it looks like we had a double top which is usually bearish. It could drop back down to near 1000 again.Or we have some whale come in and jump us up $20-$30 and we move to new territory on a nice slow climb to new highs and beyond. Like I said, intermediaries.In my semi-ideal world, the only transactions taking place at the Federal Reserve banks would be between a few conversion agencies and the government.For simplicity imagine a single company called Bitaxes. You go to their site, fill out your tax forms on their site then at the end it has a dollar amount you owe (this would be the only time dollars ever even come into play anymore). You submit your tax payment to this company in the form of bitcoins and they convert those bitcoins to dollars and send a check in your name to the IRS through the Fed bank. All your taxes get paid and everyone is happy (except you because you just got robbed).Then when the government goes to spend money, the government gives everyone their pay checks through those Fed banks but everyone has signed up with Bitaxes company to convert their paychecks to bitcoins (because nobody uses dollars anymore except the government).All of this could happen with no change in laws or the government changing a thing. The fact that people fall for the concept of "good money" and "bad money" just shows how far we have come from a free society. People accepting the concept that the government should be able to track every transaction in the world just because some people in the world may use their money for bad things is just insane.KYC and money laundering laws are just another way of saying "the government can track our every transaction". Most people are ok with this because freedom is not a very high priority in most people's lives. If most people were asked if they want their freedom or a triple mocha latte, they would be sipping on a latte soon after. [img]rocketship.jpg[\img] Definitely not. What I like about Trump is watching the liberals lose their shit.I only hope we go long enough without going to war with a military power that can actually hit their target for me to make my money and get out of Afghanistan with a healthy bitcoin wallet. ban?Edit: I just checked. Same as happens on here. Block size crap.Everyone is a software engineer. I am an IT guy but when I first heard about Bitcoin I was defensive because I thought gold was the answer.To this day I have not gone through all of the source code. But I did read the white paper and that got me.Maybe some IT people might be hesitant because they understand how vulnerable most computers are. I think it's more your economic views than your views on digital tech. There's a calculator on the website I linked to. If you own one bitcoin you are in the top 68% richest people in the world.If you have 100 bitcoins you are one of the top 8% richest people in the world.600 bitcoins and you're a one percenter.http://www.globalrichlist.com/wealth I'm ok with a 3 month doubling.  Doubling usually happens within a month for it to repeat 2013.The low was $750, January 12. We need $500 more in 10 days for this to be an exponential run. Looking at some video of the protest I suspect it was this guy in the hat and sunglasses that did it:https://youtu.be/TcmE-9hqxCc?t=93You can see him in his leather jacket, black gloves watching her and her group of friends earlier in the day.Edit: Actually it's not him. You see the dude in the hat behind her when she gets pepper sprayed.https://mobile.twitter.com/kiarafrobles When violence is justified as a central part of their philosophy (coercian via taxation to get funding), then it is inherent in their core beliefs. Come on...1024...you know you guys want it http://abc7news.com/news/video-trump-supporter-pepper-sprayed-at-milo-protest/1733004/The guy should be arrested for assault. I pay for my hosting service on a monthly basis in bitcoins.If I have a choice between a monthly service in bitcoins or fiat, I would choose the bitcoin option. Then I can cancel any time without the hassle.
tousand Yes, war is bullish for Bitcoin. Nice, I am always curious about Overstock's earnings the more they keep bitcoins.The media made sure to highlight their bitcoin holdings when the price was going down.As their assets are more bitcoins than anything else their earnings will rise closely with the bitcoin price. Did you invest more than you could afford to lose when the price was $325? I predict we'll bounce against the $1,000 ceiling a few times and "fall" all the way back down to the $930s then settle back in to the $950-$970 range for a while (but not too long). 95% makes it so that the remaining 5% won't split off and make their own "Bitcoin original" coin. As a guy who has lived overseas for the past 5 years or so, I will definitely never go back to American women. They're just not as feminine as the ladies I have interacted with in Europe and Asia. They aren't trying to be men and men aren't trying to be women. The differences are a good thing. Why would they freeze it? Just let them convert to fiat...then ask for KYC information to withdraw the money.  Shhh... Don't tell anyone but there are very few differences between fascism and socialism. The names of the people in power and positions of power may be different, but the structure is pretty much the same. Nazi was brought up before I posted. Just the long spelling of nationalism and socialism.So Hitler just "used" the nationalist socialists...was he the one that fought to centralize power?I find it interesting that socialists are shocked when they do all of this centralizing of power then they are so shocked (shocked!) that someone who is not to their liking gets hold of that power and isn't the saint that they created the position for.Nothing like that is playing out right now though. Nationalist Socialists...the last time they rose to power nothing but sunshine and lolipops spread across the world. I did see an article that said that with the Chinese exchanges adding transaction fees it should cut down on volatility.Yes, because low volume is great for volatility.   The rest of the world seeing that the Chinese exchanges were fake volume will either now realize that the jump in price was not due to Chinese rushing to get their money out of China or they will spin it as the Chinese government has cracked down on Chinese Bitcoin purchases and they are now moving their money in other ways.My confidence in the media points to them choosing the latter. Fiat is not fungible.As long as money laundering laws make one stack of cash more valuable than another stack of cash it is not fungible.Also: Bitcoin is money. That's 30 minutes a day you could have actually learned SEO or other types of advertising skills that could make you many bitcoins. Instead you waste that time and everyone else's time with useless posts. Watching on TV it seemed that many people left when it started raining. I'm surprised the Bitcoin price didn't skyrocket when Trump basically told the rest of the world "Fuck You".Or maybe it did skyrocket in other country's currencies and the dollar just became stronger? He has been a lot of talk and no specifics or sneak peeks. I wouldn't doubt if some excuse comes along where he never releases it. In 2 days MegaUpload 2.0 will be released.It is built on Bitcoin.
Looks like the initial exponential run up was stifled but we were given a reprieve by dipping so low to $750. If we can hit $1500 by Feb. 12 we're off to the races again. If we go up 10x quickly most people will jump ship at 2x, 3x, etc. expecting to crash back down.A long gradual climb to 10x will take a long time.Personally, I would rather the price rise so high that I can retire with my bitcoins. Instead of the price shooting up quickly and retiring by selling my bitcoins. Would be great if those that want to do block size discussion would make a note at the beginning of their post like:Block Size Discussion:That would help a lot in skipping posts easier. Thanks.Or...discuss it in a separate thread...like in an appropriate subforum... I think those that have been around knew that it was a speculative bubble. We all knew that it would go up and crash back down once that speculation ended. We all had our hands on the trigger hoping we'd catch the top. But it fizzled before it started. I had planned on selling half at $3k if it followed past bubbles. With the full expectation that it would crash back down to $1k where I would buy back in. But if we gradually climbed to $3k over a couple of years, I would not be selling. I agree, solid $1k by the end of 2017 though.I do believe, however, that the ETF getting approved will come with a firm move upwards that will stay up due to expanding into a market with much more money than what we have been exposed to so far. Must have been all of that hype by the US media saying that the jump in bitcoin price was due to people getting around China capital controls.While those on the ground said there wasn't much of that at all, and that there are cheaper alternatives to do that.But hey, if the US media is reporting it must be true. I can handle a year or so of going back to cheap coins. My collection is not yet complete. If you're in the US have your dad purchase through itBit. I've found that anything over $5,000 is best to go through them. You have to pay for the wire transfer but the lower exchange percentage makes up for it over $5k. It is sad that my thread created specifically to bash the signature campaigners...is flooded with signature campaigners.  time machine...paid for with bitcoinsin the future    So MegaUpload 2.0 using bitcoins and Trump becoming the president both happen on January 20.Bullish perhaps?Also, if the price is $1500 by that date it will mean it will have doubled within a month. All past jumps in price started with the price doubling in a month. We're in new territory price wise. Nobody knows any price points that are safe. We'll probably bounce up and down inside one of those triangle things until a breakout up or down. I would say that Wright went this route because he knew that his buddy who died (right around the time Satoshi said he had to leave to do other things) was Satoshi. Knowing this, he could claim to be Satoshi knowing the real Satoshi would never reveal himself. But he doesn't have the private keys. If he did he would have proved he was Satoshi long ago. Bitfinex hit $1166 but Bitfinex ATH is $1175 Looking at the charts I was wondering why this rally didn't have one of those little dip things at the beginning. If this is it, price is going to be UUUGGGE It has to hit 9000 because memes. I thought about this a bit. I was thinking that perhaps the tax implications might be better to short than to sell.Say you have 100 bitcoins that you bought for $100 each. Say you think $1100 is the top and you want to sell your 100 bitcoins. You now owe capital gains on $100,000. You still want bitcoins in the long run but you think the price will surely go down.If you short at $1100 and the price drops to $550, you've just doubled your bitcoins. You now have 200 bitcoins and no taxes to pay. Had you sold and bought again at $550 you'd have 200 bitcoins and a tax bill for about $20,000.(Of course, I may be wrong about most of that. I didn't consider it too long, I do much better when I just hold through these things, trying to time the market is not easy) I get it. You're trying to be true to Bitcoin and lead instead of follow. That's good.During the big swings you should be able to adjust your price. Bitcoin has a lot of time that is fairly stable but at times it has its growing pains to adjust to demand. During those times you'll need to adjust with Bitcoin as well.I sold someone a pair of boots for $300 when the price was about $10/BTC. The boots took over a month to get to the buyer. By that time the price had climbed to over $20. The customer was not happy about it. I gave him half of the upward value back as a gesture of moving forward with Bitcoin and keeping commerce going even when the price moves a lot. We have 15 days for the price to go up by around $400. That's an average of $25 per day. If that happens we shoot up to $6k 3 weeks later if we experience the same thing as previous run ups. Then probably a "crash" to $4,000 as it slowly returns to the $2,000 range. 1024...nerds and their numbers Looks like we're bouncing off of a gold price ceiling.
I look at it this way. In 2013 the price shot up from about $125 to about $1200. Having been in bitcoin since 2010 I knew when it went up to $200 that the price was too high for that time. But when the price finally returned to normal almost 2 years later the price was around $300 which was the right price for that time.Even though buying at $200 was buying overvalued coins...in the long run they were cheap coins.$1,000 will be cheap coins in a few years no matter what the price does in the short term. $1,000Bitcoin just joined the That is what I was talking about. Use your skills to make money.bitcoin is money How do you people that don't know how to make money eat?Just curious. My salary has been 100% bitcoin for 2 years now. I am quite pleased with my base currency being bitcoins and converting to fiat on rare occasions.I use BitWage. I hope they start allowing people in other countries to use their service. Ya, I bought way too many Namecoins. I wanted to invest in an alt coin that I really believed in and would love to see distributed domain names but others do not appear to feel the same way. China putting up more currency controls....awesome for Bitcoin! Considering you could have used the money to buy bitcoins and essentially double your money instead, what purchases did you make this year that you are now regretting?If you knew what you know now, would you have been more frugal with your money? China celebrates western New Year?I know they shut things down for like a week during Chinese New Year. So I posted the question last year of what people predicted the price would be January 1, 2017https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1309383.0Price currently $960 on bitcoinaverage (will update the January 1 price)Price when thread was started was about $430Here are some of the early predictions:My prediction: $750Closest specific predictions:1Referee: I will say $1000.diegz: price might be  $1000 or below that..LFC_Bitcoin: 925 USDBellaBitBit: 878.00Junko: $1337Oceriw: $872Range predictions:sillug: Around $1,000bajing: around $1000~Bitcoin~: i expect price to swing between 800-1kDux2K: 800 - 1000rjclarke2000: I'd say between $750 and $1k.coinzat: 500 to $1000So close:Emersonnets: $1000+tekno: 900-950$ivanst776: $700 - $900Blue_Tiger73: I predict around $1000 by the end of January. JOKES. Probably around $700.icem3lter: around $900And then...The Pharmacist: how about $430?  There's a good chance the price is going to go absolutely nowhere.kwukduck: $37What price do you believe bitcoin will be on January 1, 2018? I am curious to see what those that guessed close to this year's price have to say.My prediction: $1,000But I believe this will be the price on the way down from a new ATH, whatever that may be. (I was conservative in my last year's estimate too)(I will lock the thread after January as the last thread became signature spammer paradise) I am curious about how all of these people that don't know how to earn money even eat. How do you live? I am in favor of only taxing foreigners. Someone once asked Bill Gates how he made so much money. His answer: signature campaignsMaybe you are all onto something. I know when I want to spend my money the first thing I think of is "someone's signature". You will all be rich some day by spending hours developing your forum posting skills. There is a huge future in it. This forum will likely go on forever and the value will always go up for signatures.It's not like someone could write a computer program to post mindless drivel all over the forum and take your jobs away.   21 you're 1 in a million.210 you're in the Milli High Club.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=98239.msg9454178#msg9454178 Back in 2013 I spent $50 on a 1 bitcoin bet saying the price would be $10,000 by the end of this month.Unfortunately for those that bet against me the site went down a few years ago. And again for this increase. Don't sell, spend. I approve this price. After the run up in 2013 the result was a lot of new people that are used to the old way of doing things and so they started trying to make Bitcoin fit in with the old systems "let's regulate it!" "why not use the underlying technology in banks?!?"It reminds me of people leaving shitty Massachussets and moving to New Hampshire, then voting for taxes and big government programs that they had in Taxachussets. The reason it is a better place to live is because it doesn't have the shitty policies of your old state Massholes.Same with Bitcoin. The reason it works is because it isn't the shitty old system. Don't try to force it into the old shitty ways of finance. If you want to help make the price rise, come up with new ideas and new technology to make use of this new system. Don't look to the government or banks for the answer. It is certainly a small portion of the population just like bitcoin is only owned by a small portion of Americans. Most likely less than .0001%. That's a lot of upside.I read an article that bitcoin is overtaking gold volume in Brazil. Imagine that happening in India. Bitcoin price would be in the tens of thousands.
72. Burma  Just jumping in here before I fly off to Kuwait for another stint in Afghanistan. Would have preferred the bitcoin price be like last year while I make AF money but it's all good. Glad I put the sale of my house into bitcoin back in June.The previous bubbles started with a doubling of the price within a month. Looks like the low hit $787 in the past 3 days. If the price is over $1,500 by January 19-20th then it will be over $3k near the beginning of February and then $6k a week later. (If history is any indicator)Initially I had thought that there was nothing behind this surge but I think that just like the last bubble was China coming online, this one looks like India is coming aboard. With their government screwing with their monetary system plus the added rumor that they will ban gold (India has a huge amount of gold) the price in Rupees for bitcoin has already shot over $1k and their exchanges are being flooded with new users. The only difference this time is that China was half speculation and partly China actually starting to get involved. India coming onboard does not appear to be hyped, it's just happening. This is very flawed thinking. A bank cannot adopt the blockchain without making it a currency (don't tell them, let them waste their resources). A blockchain exists because miners are rewarded. This is the only way the double spend is solved. The only way a bank can survive is to become an exchange and then become a bitcoin service like blockchain.info. Goldman (Sachs) a lead investor in funding round for Bitcoin startup Circle:http://www.wsj.com/article_email/goldman-a-lead-investor-in-funding-round-for-bitcoin-startup-circle-1430363042-lMyQjAxMTA1NzMyMDgzODA2WjCircle CEO Allaire: Its Highly Unlikely Well Be Using Bitcoin in 5 or 10 Yearshttp://coinjournal.net/circle-ceo-allaire-highly-unlikely-well-using-bitcoin-5-10-years/Bitcoin Seller Circle No Longer Selling Bitcoin http://news.dinbits.com/2016/12/bitcoin-seller-circle-no-longer-selling.html The Caribbean, Turks & Caicos, Bahamas and several other countries have zero taxes on income and capital gains.If one were to start a business there funded by bitcoins then get paid a salary, if you live overseas, you can take in a salary of $100,000 per year tax free. You can also deduct any housing allowance your company pays you. You can drive the company car, ride in the company boat, etc. You just have to live outside the US 330 days out of the year.Or you just renounce your US citizenship and live in one of those countries and stop worrying about taxes altogether. Agreed. It is wishful thinking on my part.A 1000x increase to become a stable currency is fine by me too Make it so. A mature currency should eventually become less violent.In all reality the price is a lot more steady. While previous swings would be 50% of the price when it was under $5 to swings of 20% in the $100s...today 2-3% is significant. I used to day trade when the price was jumping around from $3 to $7. I was definitely not an expert. I learned my lesson then.  $780 on Stamp.Highest price in around 3 years. Currently it is a gift card site that happens to take bitcoins. That is a great first step, I use it quite a bit. I'm looking at it more as a bitcoin spending app that happens to use gift cards (as well as other means down the road).I have always said that the most likely hybrid solution for spending bitcoins at most places is by letting retailers keep/create their own proprietary payment solutions and finding a method for Bitcoin to talk to each solution. This allows retailers to have control over their funding options and allows bitcoiners to spend their money in more places without the need for the credit card companies, KYC and banks.We all want the final solution of being able to spend bitcoins directly at each retailer but for that to happen there has to be a large amount of people spending bitcoins in order to justify the transition for each retailer. Without a large amount of retailers accepting bitcoins there is not much justification in holding and spending bitcoins.The goal of this app would be to be able to spend bitcoins at any location that accepts gift cards, coupon codes, etc. Online and in person. There has really been no big news (real or not) that would get people to enthusiastically rush to buy, thus causing a huge spike in price.There is certainly upward pressure and optimism which is necessary for that but that is just one part. I would say that the current upward momentum is due to the upward direction over the past year and the hopes that something big can push it higher. If the price were slowly falling over the past year there would not be this type of optimism. Even at this price.Although I would love the price to jump to $3,000, I would rather have a solid price of $900-$1200 backed by adoption as opposed to short term speculation. If the price jumped to $3,000-$5,000 most people would be wanting to cash out into fiat at a huge profit. I would even consider doing so at such a high price. But then what do I have...a bunch of lousy fiat. I would rather have a solid decentralized cryptocurrency that I can spend in more places than being a fiat millionaire. I use e-gifter and Gyft. They are a great first step. You find a restaurant (or shop) on there that you want to go to then you go to that place and buy a gift card for close to the amount you are going to spend. Then you make the purchase and usually have a few dollars left over.I was thinking of something that hides all of those steps for the user. You pull up a map, see all of the places nearby that accept Bitcoin (like coinmap) but it includes all of the included gift card places as well.You walk into the shop and the app detects your location. You get up to the cashier and just pull out your app, you click "Pay" and a barcode pops up. You pay and your bitcoin balance reflects the amount you spent.Example:e-gifter & Gyft now:I want to shop at Walmart. I check to see which one has a Walmart gift card. I see that Gyft provides that card (not e-gifter, and I have to purchase Gyft points to put toward Walmart's card).Say I have a $17 purchase. I pay for a $25 gift card. I send my bitcoins. I wait for the transaction to go through. I get a $25 gift card.I pull open my Wallet on the app and choose my Walmart gift card.I pay the cashier with the barcode.Hot Wallet app:I want to buy some food. I open the app's map and see that there's a Walmart nearby that accepts bitcoin (as well as Whole Foods and maybe a local shop).I have a $17 purchase.I go to the cashier and open my payment app.The app shows a bar code and the cashier scans it.$17 payment received by Walmart, $17 is deducted from my Hot Wallet bitcoin balance.If it was a local shop accepting bitcoin directly the step would just be scanning a QR code instead of popping up a bar code. Just because you guessed at the price does not make it a conspiracy.Currently listed at $9,950,000http://www.yachtworld.com/boats/2009/Floating-Boutique-Hotel-Barge--2860786/Tampa/FL/United-StatesI'm not one to go back and forth on every detail and argue on the Internet as we quote every statement beating our chests to prove who wins the Internet.If you would like to see the business plan PM me. Like you said, we have been discussing this for almost 3 years. We have been focused solely on this, it's not like we haven't thought about everything having to do with making this successful.I leave for another stint in Afghanistan in two weeks so I can build up the final bit of money to stop work and focus solely on getting something up and running. I've left loved ones behind and sacrificed a life of leisure so I can make this happen. And it will happen. Addresses some good questions and topics in this interview.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiwLOQX1jL4 I was predicting a price of $750 for January 1 back in 2015.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1309383.0  As someone who spends bitcoins often, mainly via gift cards, I am finding the process a bit non-user friendly.I was wondering if anyone would be interested in an app where you just fill a wallet with some bitcoin spending money, then you can see on a map in your area where you can spend those bitcoins (including gift card accepting locations), you go to one of the sites and when you reach the checkout you just pull up the barcode for the cashier and pay. The conversion to gift card happens behind the scenes and you don't have to worry about buying gift cards or figuring out which card you need (location, store location, automatically does it for you).Not ideal but you would have a lot of options for spending your bitcoins with the focus being on simplicity.Would people use this? Systems ArchitectIT ManagerIntegrated Circuit Design EngineerSoftware ArchitectStrategy ManagerPharmacy ManagerSoftware Development ManagerResearch & Development ManagerLawyerPhysician That's why I rounded to $2,500 instead of $2,666.But yes, 1% is a high number. The article I read was putting Bitcoin down because their survey found "only" 1% of the participants used bitcoin for ecommerce. Can't find the article now though   Bitcoin price just passed the all time high in Nigeria.http://www.itwebafrica.com/home-page/e-commerce/700-nigeria/237095-bitx-reports-bitcoin-price-of-us125118-in-nigeria
Yep, meant billion. I read an article that was downplaying Bitcoin by saying that their survey showed that bitcoin is used for only about 1% of e-commerce.Considering world e-commerce is currently at $2 trillion with a projection of $4 trillion in 2020.1% of $2 trillion is $20 billion. A $20 trillion billion market cap for bitcoin would be $1,300 per bitcoin. In 2020 e-commerce alone could account for $2,500 per bitcoin and there are many other uses for Bitcoin. Excellent. Thanks for the input. True. Perhaps a smaller company that uses the same machines would be a good target. So do we have one of those triangle things moving in around 2 weeks or so for the big jump? http://conservativetribune.com/mcdonalds-blow-minimum-wage/?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=TeaParty&utm_content=2016-11-19&utm_campaign=manualpostI've used a McDonalds kiosk in France and Germany to order a meal. I see no reason why adding the bitcoin payment option would be a very difficult task using something like BitPay.How do we get in touch with someone that would be the decision maker on such a deal? With minimum wage laws going into place I see a lot of these things going up across the country which could turn into bitcoin payment options everywhere. I think most of us who have been in Bitcoin for several years will be deciding between doing our accounting First In First Out (FIFO) or Last In First Out (LIFO). You have to consider that the capital gains for short term gains is 10 to 20 percent higher than for long term gains (over a year). But the bitcoin price this year and in previous years has gone up so much that such a difference is not enough (for example, I started buying at $20 so I would not choose FIFO because my gains would be over 1000% on my initial coins).For me, I don't think I have ever sold bitcoins (on Coinbase) for fiat. I usually spend it. So I would choose LIFO because I have my money converted to bitcoins for each paycheck. So the gains in any given 2 week period are minimal, over the course of the year when one week may be down, one may be up it will add up to a very small amount. In the future if I were to want to cash out a large portion of my bitcoins or spend a large amount I would probably structure my holdings via some sort of Caymen Islands type of thing as opposed to paying the capital gains on thousands of percent in gains. This is usually where people say "consult an attorney" or whatever. Fuck that, you have the Internet and you probably know a lot more about Bitcoin than those assholes. Do your own research and you'll find the best way forward. It won't be until the next tax reporting year that the price will be up for the year since 2013. Most people will not have yearly gains to declare unless they are traders (not really a CoinBase thing) or they structure their spending differently (LIFO, FIFO, etc). I was going to go through the reporting thing last year but noticed that my spending was lower than my purchases throughout the year. The IRS doesn't care if you don't report losses.This year I sold my house at a loss so it will more than compensate for any gains I received via spending as the price goes up. They've always had a large amount of sells at $750. It's been bouncing off of it the past few days.  $750 wall on Bitstamp being eaten up. I was referencing the post just before mine. I just heard from a reputable source that Trump is gonna ban BTC.And China is also going to regulate BTC.  So I was in Saigon last week. I brought about 1k euro for my 10 day trip but was low on funds the last day. I don't have any credit cards or debit card but I found a Bitcoin ATM in a little pizza place.It was a pretty smooth process, fortunately I had a local phone sim card so I had a local number. It verified me via a SMS message and I sent my bitcoins via QR code on my phone wallet. Unfortunately it took more than 10 minutes for confirmation so I went shopping and got an SMS when the money was ready. Returned, entered the code from my phone and got my funds.Hopefully SegWit speeds up the process and the BTM could have used better algorithms to verify that the double spend possibilities were low. I like how some BTMs allow you to do all of transactions before you even get to the machine so it is instant when you get there.But it was good that I was able to get some quick cash via bitcoins and the shop benefited from being there since myself and my friends stuck around for a drink while we waited the 10 minutes. And my friend decided to go back to that place for dinner having read the menu. wtf just happened? Prove that Craig Wright owns any bitcoins.He cannot do this, I doubt you can either. They have been pushing every up and coming alt coin that comes along.Their business model is to act like a legit Bitcoin news source, invest heavily into an alt coin, then pump the shit out of that coin as a better solution until they hit it big. Then move onto the next alt. World markets did not go into freefall on Trumps win. Bitcoin retracing. Do not interpret my not explaining every minute detail as the team having not discussed, argued gone overboard in every direction then come to a conclusion during our meetings. My role has been as the CTO. With my contribution in setting up our Bitcoin related funding (all of our funds have been in a multi-sig wallet since the beginning due to the international nature of the project).The barge has not been listed at $25 million for some time. Our lump sum offer is under $10 million. As time goes on I am sure the price would come down even more, especially with cash in hand. An owner financed number was given closer to $10 million with a lower downpayment. However it is not really my place to be giving out negotiated numbers. I have personally seen the barge however from behind a fence as I was just passing through when I sold my Florida house.The project is not 100% locked into that barge as it could be sold or whichever might happen. It currently fits into our phase 1 solution though. Our previous phase 1 solution was to build a large concrete floating structure but the time and unknowns for that project were concluded to be far too high of a risk.Our business plan is much more detailed than anything I have ever posted here. Our marketing guy has been using that for approaching large investors.I deeply want this to happen and have invested my own bitcoins toward the project to get the ball rolling.No matter what happens, I will be living on a seastead in the next 2 years. This project is currently the furthest along toward having something in the water the soonest.  Bitcoin will be the currency of Marinea. All owners are on board with this.
To say that there are many "schemes" trying to do this same thing is not true. Marinea has been in the works for almost 2 years in various stages of readiness.I own shares as a part of the registered Marinea corporation registered in Belize (why Belize? Because we expect pushback from the US at some point).We understand the difficulty of setting up a nation. That would not come until well into phase 3 when we have a large community living in international waters on a wave protected huge setup. Yes, the first 2 phases rely upon a host nation. It is best to walk before you run. We have not made any claims otherwise. I do not see where you got the idea of that not being the case.As for the "community ripping the scheme apart", there have and will always be naysayers. Bitcointalk is just a blip of where we have gone seeking like minded people to join us.We sent a few people down to Florida to inspect the barge and got a decent appraisal of it. We negotiated with the owner down from $25 million to the $10 million or less depending upon full or partial payment. The extra $5 million is to turn it from a fisherman type of setup to a place that is more in line with sustainability and living.The Marinea corporation would then use funds from the tourism and commerce to invest into phases 2 and 3. The floating platform is the initial step. Seasteading plans have been out for almost 10 years but this is an attempt to actually get our feet in the water so to speak. Most seasteads proposed so far have been $250 million structures with $500,000 rooms. This project is an attempt to actually start doing something instead of just talking.Is the initial structure the final goal? No. You won't be able to claim citizenship or live in international waters with the initial structure. But the initial structure is where those things will be determined. Not sitting at home talking about it.As one of the co-owners, I assure you that we have tried every avenue for coming up with the best funding method for an international business that will ultimately have no country as the business location. I did not want to go the route of creating a shitcoin ICO to fund it. So ultimately colored coins are our final solution. Going for small investments of $100 instead of $500,000 seems more in the spirit of seasteading.Ultimately it will happen.  With Trump winning I will leave this here for those that want a way forward and already understand that creating an alternative system is better than stopping the old system.http://marinea.org/mag/2016NovemberIssue.pdfLibertarians need to face reality. They are trying to save people from a world that they areactually fine with. Sure some people may complain about how their government works on oneor two issues or hope that their candidate of choice will be the one that will fix those minorproblems that they see with things today. But libertarians who actually get it see thepossibilities that come from a better future where governments arent running every little partof our lives. Todays governments are good enough for most people. This message is not forthem.

This message goes tothose that understand that government is force, our fiat currency is manipulated to favor thosein power, that centralization of power only leads to the centralization of corruption, that thecurrent system is broken and that liberty is but a footnote in the thoughts of anyone with anycontrol.Most libertarians spend their lives working hard to help bring liberty to those that dont wantliberty. At least their actions demonstrate that it is not very important to them. The fact that theland of the free is deciding between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump should be proofenough to anyone that liberty has been phased out and may be something talked about infairy tales one day if allowed to do so by our future governments. Our time wasted trying tohelp others could have been spent enhancing and improving liberty in our own lives yet wefought tirelessly, we sacrificed, we put in countless hours hoping that we could make adifference in our communities.

It is time to be free.What we are proposing will not be easy.

We are not just about talk; we want toget on the sea now and have verifiable immediate results. Our research has given us an initialstructure to begin our R&D and get our feet wet by having a small community of 30 to 50people living on a floating structure that has living quarters, offices, restaurants, retail, utilitiesand the basics of starting off on our journey toward learning what life will be like for this newventure. We will also be taking baby steps when it comes to the most obvious questioneveryone has  what about the huge waves?!? Our initial location will likely be in a wellprotected area of the Caribbean in around 10 feet of water surrounded by uninhabited islandswith an average yearly wave height of 2 feet. This does mean that we will still be under thelimited laws of a country with no income taxes and very few laws. But it will be a step inthe right direction as we learn and grow as a community to reach our end goal. From there, we will learn our lessons, and this paper will be re-written by those with theknowledge to determine the next steps, whether it is a giant leap to our community ininternational waters or a larger platform or many small platforms, it is not our place to decidethat right here and now. The most important thing to do is to point in the right direction andtake that first step.The initial structure will require funds of $15 million to have it ready for initial Mariners to liveon. While we are currently working on large investors, donors or promoters, we would rather itbe a community effort with funds coming from many activists and supporters who want to getinvolved and be part of moving liberty forward right now.

Our research has given us an initialstructure to begin our R&D and get our feet wet by having a small community of 30 to 50people living on a floating structure that has living quarters, offices, restaurants, retail, utilitiesand the basics of starting off on our journey toward learning what life will be like for this newventure. We will also be taking baby steps when it comes to the most obvious questioneveryone has  what about the huge waves?!? Our initial location will likely be in a wellprotected area of the Caribbean in around 10 feet of water surrounded by uninhabited islandswith an average yearly wave height of 2 feet. This does mean that we will still be under thelimited laws of a country with no income taxes and very few laws. But it will be a step inthe right direction as we learn and grow as a community to reach our end goal. From there, we will learn our lessons, and this paper will be re-written by those with theknowledge to determine the next steps, whether it is a giant leap to our community ininternational waters or a larger platform or many small platforms, it is not our place to decidethat right here and now. The most important thing to do is to point in the right direction andtake that first step.The initial structure will require funds of $15 million to have it ready for initial Mariners to liveon. While we are currently working on large investors, donors or promoters, we would rather itbe a community effort with funds coming from many activists and supporters who want to getinvolved and be part of moving liberty forward right now. As such, we have set up a way forindividuals to become a member for a minimum of $100 for the purchase of one SeaNote.Every SeaNote gives you access to our updates, monthly magazine, discounts for any futurevisit to Marinea on things such as hotel rooms, restaurants, products, etc. as well as beingable to trade that SeaNote in for citizenship once we have established our future community.We will only be making 150,000 SeaNotes available and will be setting up an exchange totrade your SeaNotes on the open market on a decentralized crypto-token market.Whatever the outcome of our funding drive, we are dedicated and hope you join us in movingforward toward actually making something happen and taking steps toward liberty that we canall follow. Our energies need be no longer wasted on those that do not care nor deserve anymore of our productivity. It is time to focus on bringing liberty to each other so that we may allthrive and move forward together and leave those that do not share our vision to their ownpaths in life.You can join us in this journey to freedom at http://marinea.org/join/ You mean 2 days before my prediction of $750? I'd say about $750....? I guess it was $750.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1309383.0 Sure, a long slow steady climb would be nice. And that is best for Bitcoin being accepted as a currency alternative. But...it's just so damned exciting when the price is flying up by 10% a day for weeks on end...The cup and handle charts do show a huge skyrocket though.  I feel like we are near the price we should be at (I predicted the price would be $766 on 1/1/2017 back on 1/1/2016 when the price was around $300).    lolzIs this Trump guy still running? Nobody's figured out it's just a joke yet? Posted on OpenBazaar but I'll ask here.I'd like to buy a few of these.I have a German mailing address and a US APO address. Which is better as far as shipping goes? True, the price kept going down because that was the trend. People were not investing in a currency that had been losing value over the past year.Now that they see the price going up they will want to get in on a currency who's value has gone up over the past year.Even my ultra-liberal (bitcoin is stupid) friend saw the price and said "Maybe I should stick $10k in bitcoin" today. Meanwhile I convinced my investor buddy who has over $1 million in stocks to buy his first bitcoin at $635, he just set up a weekly $400 buy.It is feeling very much like 2013 again. If it is X% of miners selling their coins. That number is still cut in half. X% of miners selling half the previous amount of coins. It usually starts with the Bitcoin price doubling in a month. Bitcoin 0.13.1 released (with Segwit)https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/2016-October/000023.html Although the list is totally inaccurate and created by anti-Bitcoin alt pumpers, it does give me a warm and fuzzy knowing that the people with the most money in the new economy will be those that actually supported the original intent of Bitcoin and its reason for coming into being. As opposed to the "we need to regulate Bitcoin!" crowd and the "the blockchain is the answer (because we still worship Keynes)!" crowd. Since we're throwing out baseless numbers you can add:2. BTC500,000 Elwar Not to jinx it but if we get past $778 we will see what we did in 2013. Hmm, no blocksize debate...predictions in the thousands...My bot would be selling like crazy right now (if I were a trader).
I wonder if all exchanges will consolidate on $666.Looks like Bitfinex doesn't want to touch it while Bitstamp is slowly moving toward it. I think the most likely scenario, at least in the short term, is that most companies will move more toward their own payment system (gift cards) for payment at their stores. More people will use it and more tools will become available so you can pay at any store with any payment system you like. Taking the onus off of the retailer for payment processing and moving it to a new third party layer. "City banks plan to hoard bitcoins to help them pay cyber ransoms"Experts say blue chip companies have decided its cheaper to deal with extortionists than risk damaging attackshttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/22/city-banks-plan-to-hoard-bitcoins-to-help-them-pay-cyber-ransomsIntrinsic value! If they have only a few private bankchain "nodes" doing the "mining" then you only need to hack one and use an ASIC miner to 51% attack the network and increase the difficulty to the point that when you pull your ASIC off of the network they either have to upgrade to ASICs to keep going or the difficulty will not allow any further blocks. Or use your 51% to doublespend. Looks like merchants can easily accept Bitcoin if they have an Ingenico POS terminal and a BitPay account. Have any merchants done this?https://bitpay.com/integrations/ingenico What world does this guy live in where most exchanges charge 5%?

All of Hillary's supporters must have sold their coins after she said she doesn't like the freedom part of Bitcoin. I believe it is also 21 million. They were mostly a copy of Bitcoin. What would you cash it out into?Strong hands that love paying taxes to a government that funds terrorists? Here is the thread with the list and reviews of common places to use your bitcoins:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0A good blog is http://www.bitcoinspender.com Oooh...block size talk is back...cheap coins! Only damage he did was get his name on some report that the SEC used to extend the date of the rule change in order to facilitate yet another of the 100s of ways to get bitcoins. Which they would have done anyway.I can still get paid and live on bitcoins. Bitcoin user not affected. The United States SEC is taking advice from some foreign guy from a country who's corrupt government is collapsing. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the selfregulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) by order approve or disapprove such proposed rule change; or (b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved." Not directly but I was testing the bitquick bitcoin sales via euro bank transfer. Some jackhole reversed the SEPA transaction (which I did not know could be done), claimed his account was hacked so DB called me and told me they were going to reverse the transaction. Nothing I could do, tough luck on my part (fortunately it was only about 150 euro). One week later they dropped my account. Soon after that they started having financial problems.Coincidence?   No idea really. I don't watch the German news because I don't speak German. I avoid the US news because it's depressing.I do know that my landlord started pulling some money out of the bank and holds more cash than he used to. And he's very open to taking bitcoins for rent. He's actually the perfect Bitcoin user. I pay him bitcoins in rent and he's a pilot for Lufthansa so he flies to other countries a lot. He goes to the US and uses Gyft to buy gift cards for just about everywhere he goes. Mainly Home Depot, Target, Whole Foods and some restaurants. He loves it. He used to use his PayPal credit card that charged him a huge exchange fee whenever he used it in the US.Deutsche Bank canceled my account with them so they can crash and burn for all I care. If I recall correctly that giftoff site had some Skype vouchers. I also saw that there were several overseas (UK?) gift card sites that offered Skype and accepted Bitcoin as payment.
Noticed Bitstamp is not on Bitcoinity under top USD exchanges. Did their volume drop or something? Less than GDAX(?)? But the rule change basically opens the door for the ETF in such a way that they don't have to go through the several years long process. It essentially lets them piggyback on other structures by changing the rule to include cryptocurrency.Most likely it will not be approved tomorrow because they can extend it one more time. Government loves punting. But it rewards you in dollars.  Banks will only create centralized blockchains. They will fail.  I see this often "banks should start working with Bitcoin users since that's where things are headed, why not cooperate?".If you think your bank is going to keep your bitcoins in some account then you can use your debit card to convert to dollars at the point of sale then you don't really understand the main revenue of banks.Banks hold your dollars in their bank accounts. They then turn around and leverage your dollars in their account by 10 times to issue loans to people where they get their main revenue. If people are holding their funds in bitcoins and only using banks as a transaction medium the bank is not making much money.Don't expect banks to embrace Bitcoin. The reason they're all creating their own "blockchains" is so they can make it so that they can hold your funds and leverage it.Every central bank warning about Bitcoin is another central bank realizing that they are going to lose if people start using Bitcoin. I have been using Brave as my main browser for about half a year now. The latest update they started accepting bitcoin donations toward websites. After ignoring this for a few weeks I finally decided to add $5 worth of bitcoins to my Brave wallet. Just so that at least someone is doing it and to see how things work as far as them awarding sites that I visit. You can opt out of some websites that you might not want to award (like if I visited Huffington Post for an article or some other liberal site).They are going through a few phases. The first phase is accepting bitcoins from users and distributing to sites. The second phase will be adding their own ads and getting paid by advertisers. The last phase is paying users if they choose to view their ads.I think this is good overall toward funding websites in the future. If the whole Internet adopted this the revenue of Google would now be going through Bitcoin as ad revenue is the major source of Google's funding. The last time bitcoin had such low volatility was mid April.Good things happened soon after.It's actually at the lowest 60 day BTC/USD volatility it has ever been. Bitcoin can easily do the same as this ad.Send bitcoins for Free!** Small transaction fee may apply When you go to spend bitcoins you see the dollar amount of $X and then a QR code that says send Y bitcoins to this address. Do you think people actually go to the exchange to check the price then open a calculator to figure out if the bitcoin value they are sending is the latest value? As someone who spends bitcoins all the time, I assure you they do not. If there's a .00001 BTC fee added to the .28421482 price I'm paying it's not deterring me from spending. If he was American he should have created a corporation in one of the island nations with zero taxes. He could then transfer all of his bitcoins to that corporation.Then if he moves overseas (at least 330 days out of the year) he can have the corporation pay him up to $100,000 per year salary with no income taxes. He can also deduct any overseas housing the corporation pays for.He can drive the corporate car or ride in the corporate boat.Doing this he pays no taxes. He gets interviewed all the time. He doesn't have a lot of bitcoins. He always says that he is glad he spent the bitcoins because it helped to prove that Bitcoin can be used as a currency. Some people actually want Bitcoin to succeed and not just hold onto them contributing nothing but shitty signature posts. Stolfi is living on r/Buttcoin now and has done an interview: https://soundcloud.com/bitcoinuncensored/buttcoin-vs-bitcoin-with-jorge-stolfi-of-rbuttcoin-king-of-the-butters Should I go all in fiat now?Or not invest more than I'm willing to loose? All the trouble? Like the price shooting up over $1000? Bump as this year people designate someone to hire people to steal. I am going to set up a trading bot to buy when this thread gets full of "block size" talk and sell when there are debates about how many thousands of dollars bitcoin will soon be worth. Most the guys I traded with were the typical middle aged german males.Fortunately Germany treats bitcoin as "private money" so it's legal for private individual to individual sales. But since it's a currency you can't set up an exchange without going through the legal requirements of a currency exchange. That's why localbitcoins is not able to run in Germany (unless they want to go through all of the legal red tape).I stopped when I started getting Eastern European customers that were shady. Like I said, I wasted my time and gas with a lot of transactions. Had stuff happen to me a few times. Sometimes I would break even and wonder if it was worth the time and gas.But every good trade builds your reputation so it's good in the long term. Nah, I couldn't hold a conversation in German. I can order food and survive. That's about it.
2FA really turns me off of most exchanges. Since I cannot bring my phone to work I am stuck only using sites with 2FA at home. This sucks when I'm sitting at my computer at work and want to buy something or pay a bill or whichever.I understand the reason for it, but Bitfinex also had 2FA which was completely bypassed. I was talking to the owner of the local restaurant about bitcoin and he was considering accepting it. He likes that the fees are minimal compared to his credit card service, the no charge backs, the fact that the currency is not a government currency that is built to lose value, how he can send it all around the world within seconds. But then he asked "is there any new development"?I said not much, just some usual improvements at a stable pace as necessary for a developing new currency.He immediately kicked me out of his restaurant and told me to never return.  So...you can use your bank account to pay via NFC?moon? Who is investing "more than they can afford to lose"?If you invested the money then you obviously had the money. Unless you have no job then you have the means to get more money.If you're sitting there with $50k to pay for mom's medical bill and you instead convert it to bitcoins then yes, maybe that is not a smart choice. For me, BTC/USD could go to $0 and I'd be fine. Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of value lost but in 2 weeks I'll get a paycheck and can pay for my living expenses.Even if you take a loan out to buy bitcoins, too bad for your creditor if it goes to zero. I actually wouldn't mind some Bitfinex equity if it survives this. Exchanges make a lot of money and you can't invest in most exchanges. Other than buying that Romanian exchange that shut down. Probably. I'd rather lose 15% right now than 75% in legal shit and time wasted. At least their BFX is up to 60 cents each. Two thirds of our funds returned and 60% of the last third available. So about 85% returned at this point. I'm still holding out for full re-reimbursement.  legit This calculator is good at showing the many drivers of the bitcoin price (never left alpha stage but still pretty good)http://worldbitcoinnetwork.com/BitcoinPriceModel-Alpha.html July 1st news?We're waiting for October for the ruling to be extended another 3 months before it gets extended 3 months. That makes a lot of sense for the DHT. I initially figured I could grab some IPs after a search of other people using the plugin but that it would likely change. A separate d/ name with the IPs would work quite well. Thanks.Letting pages expire is probably best anyway so most data is relatively new.

Time to sell my account and retire a rich man!Post quality Fair? I beg to differ. I'm never fair.   I was looking into something other than a dns entry.I have been working on this concept and was thinking that instead of a Bitcoin OP_RETURN, this might be best route might be using Namecoin's ledger as it is about as secure as Bitcoin but is built more for such concepts:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1593635.0 If these big jumps are coming from a single Chinese exchange then that is cause for concern for anyone on that exchange.I used to trade on Bitcoinica way back in the day when it was the only place you could margin trade. At the time I had about 700 bitcoins that I would use to do some margin trading. I started to notice that just as my short or long was about to start making money there would be one of these huge movements in the opposite direction to the point where I would get squeezed. Once or twice would be a fluke but after so many times and several other people having a similar experience I pulled the rest of my bitcoins off of there (about 4-500). A week later they got "hacked". Later on there was some talk of Zou tong's friend/colleague was manipulating the price to squeeze people's trades.I figured those days were behind us because it would take a lot of money to move the market that much. But who knows, maybe the chinese exchanges are just changing numbers in a database to move the price. Either way, be wary of doing margin trading or keeping your money on that exchange. The only thing the ban did was it froze competition. They blocked the IPs from Germany and made it so you can't create new ads in Germany. What this did was make it so that people that already had ads were now the only people selling bitcoins in Germany and they could charge high rates because of it. People still connected to the ads via VPN or whichever route they needed to take and once you were logged in you had access to all of your ads and messages anyway.So by "blocking" it, all they did was create monopolies. As governments tend to do. From what I hear you can send fiat via Circle Pay's fiat service via the iMessage. :/ It's pay day so I am. Bitcoin is money.
After the halving I think the average climb will be around $20 per month while the average climb per month from the last halving to this most recent one was about $13 per month.$20 rise per month on average would not be bad at all. There was some downward pressure at $666 already before the Bitfinex thing. The drop to $570 was a bit of an extreme reaction so we are certainly correcting. I think the small amount of downward pressure is likely being eaten up by the 2 months of halved rewards so high $600s is likely this month. Followed by months of rising that is faster than before the halving. Barring any huge news that jumps or drops the price. Up up up. 23 pages of people saying the exact same thing.Another quality thread. That's some good shit.I like seasteading until we can do that: Start proposing non-socialist solutions? Just a quick question.Is the max transaction value size still 520bytes? Or was that every changed? Also, is the OP_RETURN size 80 bytes like for Bitcoin? Heh, I guess I shouldn't have stuck my opinion into a religious debate.I'm sure you'll find whatever government studies to back your beliefs. I don't argue with religious fanatics that can quote scripture for anything I might say so I'll leave you to your beliefs.As I always tell my global warming friends that start preaching...Once your solution to global warming does not involve giving the government even more power, then I'll start taking the "science" seriously and look at the data. Until then, I'll sit on the side of skepticism. Actually old trees are pretty much done when it comes to soaking up carbon. New trees soak it up quite a bit as they grow. Clearing out old trees and planting new is good for the planet. That's cool, I did some research beforehand and several people came up with their own wall mount solutions for tablets such as yours. There are some universal wall mounts that look pretty hideous and decent ones that cost over $150 just for the mount, but it is hidden.The tablet I use is made to be mounted on the wall and the power chord is behind it so you can either run power behind (in the wall) it or just paint the line like I did. Did you get a wall mount for it? So I'm working on this, figured I'd give folks here a first peek since you're the ones that would appreciate having something like this.The final product will have a better price display that I'm still working on, I just grabbed a zoom in of bitcoinity for this stage of development.Price would probably be around $125 to $150 to make a profit.Is this something you would buy?  The majority of this happens where a bond is sold at a negative percentage rate and a city or government entity is obligated to use that bond mechanism by laws created when it made sense so they're stuck buying them. That would be nice. lolBut of course the consumer does not benefit from negative interest rates, just the banks. You have to pay to have your savings in the bank. Yep. My landlord, who I spent all year telling about Bitcoin, now wants bitcoins due to the negative interest rates. I don't use German banks. I have a US account but no longer use it. I'll do like I did with my credit cards, after 6 months if I don't use it I'll close it out.And the central banks are saying what they're doing isn't enough...that they need to think up some more extreme measures because the market isn't "reacting" the way they'd hoped when they opened the floodgates. Who's the bigger fool? The fool who accepts donations or the fool who donates to fools? I explained Bitcoin to my grandmother and she thought it was a great solution to the problems of banking and fiat currencies. She pulled out her pocketbook to buy some bitcoins then she stopped and said"wait, are the blocks going to scale beyond 1mb or are they going to offer some sort of channel solution to handle transaction volume?"I told her it was still under discussion.She slammed her pocketbook shut and said "I'll stick with fiat thank you very much!" Donald Trump deserves to be president. Look at all of these helpful charities he donated to: And that is where we are currently focused. Our marketing guy, Bob, is focusing on the large investors including just going for a business loan since our Phase 1 will have a large floating structure that can be financed like a large boat.I would imagine if we got 2 million without reaching our 15 million goal we would scale down the first phase and get something in the water at a lower cost as a proof of concept to move forward.As for timeline we would be floating probably within 6 months of hitting the funding goal. I'm one of the board members and I can say it's not a scam. I'm just the IT guy so I can't say this is the best funding strategy but we went through many different iterations of trying to come up with funding. Being an international company that will not be based in a single country we started hitting legal walls. Initially we were going to sell shares and provide dividends but that would bring in all sorts of difficulty with any US investors which cuts out a major block of funding.Our marketing guy seems to think people would be willing to pay $100 for potential citizenship and discounts down the road or just because they're excited about the possibility. But as an investor myself I do not see the return on investment that would be worth it. We considered creating an alt coin and using that as the currency on the seastead but considering people on the seastead can buy things in the US with bitcoins a lot easier than using some alt, and bitcoin has worldwide use I suggested against yet another alt coin.It is a good incremental solution though. Most proposals are looking for $200-$300 million for a huge final community without any stages of testing before then.
Like I said, you take the latest OP_RETURN from the address. So every time you update your page you just send the transactions again.Hillary has stated that she wants to take down certain websites that are critical of her when elected. This may become something necessary sooner rather than later. I may as well use Onecoin.Bitcoin is the most secure ledger in the world. Having the highest security in the world for a site would be a good thing to have. Seastead company, Marinea, is planning on using bitcoin as its initial currency.http://blog.marinea.org/?p=114#more-114 Debates don't start until September 26. I'm working on a simple Bitcoin price ticker. I know there are several but this one will serve a specific purpose. What sites do you use and what parts of the site interest you the most?I personally usually open bitcoinity.org and like that the price shows up in the tab. I also like checking the past 24 hour chart when I wake up to see what the price was up to while I was asleep. The high, low and percentage change for the day is also interesting to see. You can develop if you want. It's open source. The tweet was from 2012.Maybe he was just a big fan of Obamacare considering...you know..Trump supports universal healthcare. Like...you know...a socialist. It uses the same address structure as Bitcoin so you can just use VanityGen to get a public/private key and write down the private key. Does non-blurry make it more legit? It was grabbed from Trump's twitter the day after the election but has since been taken down.Sounds like sour grapes about some promise that was probably made.Who knows, Trump is insane. There is no logic to what he says. Interesting. A javascript bittorrent client. I'd still need the extension to go to the blockchain and get the OP_RETURN. I have been mulling something over and would like to get some input.I would like to make a serverless webpage using the blockchain + bittorrent.Let's assume I have a web site with an HTML, some css and a few images compressed into a .zip file of 1Mb.I then create a .torrent of that zip file, which includes a hash of the file's parts, and start seeding the file. Assume the .torrent file is 200 bytes in size.I then create a Bitcoin transaction from address 1WEBaj42k2j23lk23nk23jlk2n1kj to any address. I pay the transaction fee and include an OP_RETURN with 80 bytes from the .torrent with a preceding number like 1/3.Then I send another transaction from the same address with another 80 bytes with a preceeding number 2/3, etc.So now there is a series of OP_RETURNs from address 1WEBaj42k2j23lk23nk23jlk2n1kj that can be referenced from any Bitcoin node that tracks OP_RETURNs.Now I create a browser extension that accepts btctp:/1WEBaj42k2j23lk23nk23jlk2n1kj as an input which then goes to that address and gets its last series of OP_RETURNs.It puts together the .torrent file and connects as a bittorrent client to download the .zip file. The extension then extracts the contents of the .zip file and displays the web page.This would prevent DDoS attacks. It would prevent hacks of your server. It would allow people behind censoring firewalls like China to get information and allow anyone to post simple content without the need for a hosting service.And you are paying the miners in transaction fees. You pay the miners for larger .torrents so they are compensated and you pay for any updates you make, all via transaction fees.Thoughts?  He didn't register Republican until a year after voting for Obama. You're in good company. So is Trump. Looks like there are still a bunch of Trump supporters who don't know he's a Democrat working for the same people Hillary is.Notice how much media attention he gets vs Hillary?When they wanted to stop Ron Paul did they report on the "crazy" things he said?Or did they just ignore him?Ignoring worked against Ron Paul, why would they not do the same to Trump if they truly did not support him? I can verify that I heard this rumor. Welcome to the thread. They're likely moving their nukes due to what happened a few weeks ago with Turkey sending their troops to "inspect" that base. Basically they are not well enough equipped to stop an army from taking all of the nukes, so they're moving to a more stable country. I'm so confused after that episode.I think their talk about e-coin is like the bank's blockchain coin. But ya, they are not being Bitcoin friendly tying it to evil things implying that allowing the market to do its thing will end in people selling sex slaves and hired assassins. OMFG if you believe Trump wants peace...just OMFG"Why don't we just nuke them?" -Donald TrumpAs a defense contractor I look forward to the gobs and gobs of money I will make under Hillary/Trump but I worry about the big targets we will go after because they actually have weapons that could do damage to me when I work on base. 
Nope. Good-bye thread.Locked. I'll try again this weekend. I paid with my Breadwallet and got the message of "your payment to BitPay was received" etc.But the transaction just sat there. And looking at my transaction history on my Breadwallet doesn't show that transaction. I'm sure it's nothing with the site. I'd just rather hold off to see if anything pops up on my app later. Site looks legit though. That's a new one I haven't seen before. Looks like I can get cards there easily. Thanks. I see that they offer Skype cards on Amazon. I can buy an Amazon card on gyft and get it there. I used to pay for my Skype with credits I bought from gyft.com but it doesn't look like they offer it anymore. Any other places to get Skype credit for Bitcoin? Any chance on a Skype card? That was that dude trying to get some tail.http://motherboard.vice.com/read/was-a-bizarre-600k-bitcoin-lottery-really-a-marriage-proposal-rekcahxfb On the cloud?I haven't looked at the specs yet. It still needs LN for it to work so there is some time before the release. Block size debate does not have to invade every thread. This is exactly it. I explained Bitcoin to my brother the other day and he was like...it sounds like the transactions are too slow. When will Lightning Network be ready? I hadn't even gotten to block size or LN.I read on a news show that people are waiting with money in their fist for whatever solution you think is the best. Though, they actually understand the difference between transactions and confirmations so you may want to do a bit of research on that one. I agree, it is definitely not easy. It takes some thought to figure out how to pay for things when all you have is bitcoins.It is like a lot of new things, like the tiny house movement. You have the first few that show it can be done. Then things start to get easier over time. And it does get easier. My own attempt to detach from fiat is not just for myself but to prove that it can be done. And it can. My location or the infrastructure around me is a lot more difficult than it is for most people as I am in a foreign country where I do not even speak the language.Sure, in places without the Internet it may be difficult. I defer to those places alternatives to Bitcoin.Telling the first people with telephones that people will not want to invest in these expensive devices that can only be used to talk to a few people who also have telephones that they should just stick with the telegraph because a large majority of folks are not going to put up with such large hassle and expense with so few rewards.Volatility goes away when those majority of people are using Bitcoin. And the fiat system will go the way of the telegraph. That would be true if that's what I said. Once you have bitcoins you shouldn't need to go back to the fiat system and all the problems that come with it. I think the Bitfinex hack has more of us on edge because at least with MtGox there were months and months of warning signs including the inability to withdraw your fiat, their dwolla account being closed, etc. So most people who had any intelligence got out. The only people still on MtGox before it was "hacked" were taking advantage of wild swings due to pure chaos on the exchange.With Bitfinex it was seen as fairly secure because it had been around as long as most of the older exchanges, it had gone through a lot of transparent security measures and everyone felt fairly confident in the exchange (as confident as you can be). I even used to recommend to people that they use Bitfinex to loan their fiat for 20-30% yearly. They would tell me that such returns required high risk. My response was that since each loan was paid back the only risk was the exchange going under, which was not likely.This is not a faulting of Bitcoin itself, but people might not feel very confident putting any money on any exchange if Bitfinex could be hacked. This cuts down on the speculation aspect of Bitcoin which contributes to the price. It is just a matter of time without an exchange hack to get people to feel more confidence in trading again.When it comes down to it, most of Bitcoin's problems tend to come from the interactions with the fiat system.In the short term, it's going to be a good buying opportunity. Long term we're still solid. No 403 error. Bitcoin's still kickin. One likely caused the other...but which?      I was a bit down about the price being so high. I have a goal amount of bitcoins that I want and the higher price is pushing my retirement date a bit further. Six months below $500 would be perfect for me but that's very unlikely.  Pasted with ...
Sweet. Thanks for all the hard work. Strange. Burn your bitcoins and get this alt coin in exchange automagically.Buy bitcoins back on the market. What's this? A new namecoin? Or an update? I don't think they're going down a very good path for Bitcoin though. There's a "Silk Road" and they paint it as a place to have people killed or to buy sex slaves and all of that other nastiness.So they obviously don't "get it". ItBit seems more like an exchange for the wealthy and companies for one time exchanges. Not really for day trading. I'm surprised they have as much volume as they do.Maybe it is an exchange that Americans are using to trade because it is the only one in the US they can trade on. Wasn't much downward pressure when the price was over $650 and that was before the halving. Plenty of room to go up up up. I got my 64% back.I'm thinking I'll need to use the courts to get the rest back but it's almost worth $5000 to not have to deal with the US justice religion. Withdrawal is on its way finally. Must have been the empty hot wallet.Anyone in the US want to get in on this once in a lifetime opportunity to buy some BFX? These things are going fast. Only $1 each. Shit, I didn't know we'd be able to trade BFX right away. Now the price is down at .40 each.Bitfinex can come in at any time and buy these back and claim they made us "whole". An hour passed and the withdrawal is still not even begun. Usually it's immediate. In other words...everyone's trying to withdraw! Stop before we have no more money! That's what I did. Submitted the withdrawal but still waiting on any bitcoins to move. They did mention something about doing it manually starting out. Withdrawal is open now...just waiting on my e-mail. Withdrawal option still not available for BTC   And we're off...price shot up to $612 Orders on Bitfinex are being readied...looking like $600 to $604. Price is coming back.$666 soon after Bitfinex comes back up. Price cannot drop on a crypto tied to the price of the dollar.Unless this was some centrally controlled crypto...oh wait.Should've just had an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of everyone's balance. Her brain clot seizures don't give much confidence:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMHOcmDVBP0 
It will make other exchanges think twice when they go to spend money on extra security measures. They can just "do what BitFinex did" if anything bad ever happens. This is all that matters.I have only seen "BFX tokens, which can eventually be exchanged for shares of Bitfinex".Whatever that means. Nah, I just live in Europe.  I lost a lot more from the price drop.I don't believe they are going to open BFX tokens to be sold for a while. Even then, we are all relying on $65 million worth of investment to come in and buy those tokens. I'll do what I can to be in the front of the line for anyone wanting to buy. I was able to log into my Bitfinex account. Of the 31 bitcoins I have a balance of 20 bitcoins (which I will withdraw immediately once the option is available). I have 412 USD and about 7000 BFX (tokens).I have no idea why I have dollars on there, I've never had dollars on there. I'll be buying bitcoins with them and withdrawing those as well.As for the whole token concept. I had been working with an international company for quite some time and we had been trying to come up with a way to sell shares to raise our initial funding. With the company being based in Belize with Bitcoin as our main currency and the blockchain being used for tracking our shares we would not be like any other company. But with half of the board living in the US and not wanting to lose US customers we had to figure out a way to word things so that we were not offering "shares" or "dollars" or anything else that had some sort of legal connotation. We played around with the idea of tokens because any company can sell tokens. We planned on selling a set amount of them being a percentage share of our company. But when talking to lawyers we found out that linking a token's value to shares of the company would defacto turn it into shares and subject us to all sorts of rules and limitations that just wouldn't work for us. I kinda lost confidence in our business model when we still decided to go with a "token" type of setup but not a limited number and turned it into more of a membership model with not much reward (that I can see) for being a member. But I'm just the IT guy so I am leaving it in the hands of our marketing guy to figure it all out. I would like to see Bitfinex define what exactly a BFX represents and make sure it is set in stone. Otherwise I will just cash them out. Their initial value is being set to $1 each.If they are actually representative of a percentage share of their company with dividends then I would consider keeping them. But they likely cannot say that legally, so they become a very shitty centralized alt coin with unlimited printing ability that you can't use for anything. I'm ok with the idea of only losing 36% with the alternative being losing everything as they go bankrupt with the chance to get maybe 1-2% back after a long lawsuit and fight to get anything.They say we'll get BitFinex "tokens" which will be turned into shares of BitFinex stock...but the key here is the way these are issued. If tokens are not fixed to a percentage of the company that represents the current value of the loss then they can just print tokens like dollars and the value of each token would go away quickly.If, instead, it is a fixed percentage of BitFinex as the value of the company then I'm ok with that. I'd only lose about 10 bitcoins that are converted to shares in a major Bitcoin exchange which could do well in the future. I'm in this for the long term so risking 10 bitcoins for exclusive access to owning shares of BitFinex is fine with me. It won't break me and I can hope that over the long term it does well. I'd be fine if they set aside a monthly percentage to pay people back over time from their profits.They would likely reimburse the smaller amounts first since that is a larger amount of people, then work with the larger amounts.Or go bankrupt and have to go through what Gox is going through. Bank wires are different from SEPA in Europe and ACH in the US.Some banks might be cheaper and not charge $30 but that's what I'm stuck with right now.A $10 fee plus .2% is reasonable on itBit's end. It's actually .2% for buyers and 0% for sellers (I think).Everything bad about Bitcoin is almost always when fiat is involved.   I've been using itBit. I was going to buy via Coinbase but their restrictions and all of that are too difficult to make it useful.With itBit I have to wire my money to the exchange which costs me $30 on my bank's end and $10 on itBit's side and it costs .2% for a trade. Compare that to Coinbase's 1%.So if you look at a $10,000 deposit for both:itBit: $30 + $10 + $20 = $60CoinBase: $100Anything over $5,000 is cheaper with itBit.But itBit is just a whole lot less restrictive than Coinbase is. I haven't been without a job since I was 14. I doubt I would ever be without one. Even if I was retired I'd still work. So I don't know how I'd feel without one.As for the wallet, that's the point. You don't have to worry so much about money without a lot of stuff. My monthly spending on essentials is about 10% of my income and I could easily drop that down to 4-5% if I had to. That's one of the hacker's addresses I assume. It's not all in one final address. Ahh yes. No idea where I got 195k. I tracked mine here:https://blockchain.info/address/1JZrner13nGZZvnvbY2BtR4AkUv3byVJteThey did not verify that my account was hacked but because it is no longer in a multisig wallet they said it is likely. Update from BitFinex: The "stolen" BTC was gone long before Gox was "hacked". Already spent on Lattes and exercise balls. That's why I wish I could buy right now. 195k bitcoins are now gone from the exchange. They will likely not be spent or cashed out for years due to so many eyes on those coins. I can see the address where my bitcoins are sitting.So...all of those bitcoin traders from BitFinex will need to get more bitcoins with smaller supply. As far as BitGo...from what I could tell on reddit, there were two setups. People who verified their identities and had a BitGo setup. And the rest who did not go through verification and had some other setup. I did not do any of that verification. Meh...I still have twice the amount of money that I had a year ago. And I had a lot then. Just wish I was getting paid this Friday instead of next Friday. The government used to steal more than that from me on a yearly basis. Now they don't. I'm not sure how that worked. They say Bitgo had one address, and it was 2 of 3 multi-sig so wouldn't that mean that Bitfinex had the other two addresses? I certainly didn't have one of the three. Over here in Europe I get the question all the time. "What's the deal with Americans? Are they really supporting Donald Trump for president?!?!".Sadly enough, when Hillary wins they will be asking why our crazy president is starting so many wars. The ironic thing is that I was going to take the $150k worth of bitcoins from the sale of my house and put it on Bitfinex so I could loan it out and get interest. I figured they had been stable for several years which is rare in the Bitcoin world.Almost 2 months later and I'm still not finished moving it all to my cold storage address with all of the hoops I have to jump through to get it there.
I get tempted to buy things all the time. There are billions of dollars spent to psychologically get us to buy stuff. I just go back every time and remember that it has to fit in my carry on or backpack. Then the temptation goes away because I remember that my life is a lot easier without all of those things. The irony was that I took my 35 bitcoins off of Coinbase because I was getting tired of their shit. I figured I'd rather have it on Bitfinex where I can do some leveraged trading every once in a while if I saw the opportunity. Plus it was easier to withdraw money from there when I wanted to pay for things. At least I spent 4 of the coins, booked a flight to Vietnam for vacation.31 wasn't much for me but I still hope they try to compensate everyone over time. I had 31 BTC on Bitfinex. It was likely one of the hacked addresses.I hope they compensate all of the stolen coins. Though to do that they probably lose more money than they have which requires that they go fractional reserve which also means they eventually become Mt Gox 2.0.  10,000 alt coins, no decisions on block size...this is why libertarians can't have nice things  We're in price discovery mode right now. Between $420 and $666 there is no stable price. Above $666 to $1337 there will be no stable price either. People like their significant numbers. This drop is because someone has the inside information that neither Hillary nor Trump are going to win.  What's up Bitcoin world. I see that the price is down. That must mean that the economies of the world are healthy and on track with some good fundamentals. Great to hear.Let me know if that changes. This one looks as good as anything I could've put together:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlhoFg8qHo After looking into what happened with the hard fork I will not buy either.The fact that any contract can be recalled by a centralized authority it makes no sense to go with the overhead of a "decentralized" network when the same thing can be done with a simple website with some java code. The first time some government does not like a contract they can just force Vitalik to stop it. Imagine a government trying to reverse a Bitcoin transaction a month after it took place. It wouldn't happen. Might as well wait for RootStock which does the same thing as ethereum but on Bitcoin's much more secure network. The price was having a difficult time rising. The market grew impatient. ETC is not meant to be a long term investment. You should only buy it to spend on a smart contract once they get that code working. Bitcoin volatility index: 2.5% What will be necessary to please the Donald once he is in charge of the world? How will one be able to gain favor so as not to be sent to the camps? The ETF won't go through until they get to the point when the SEC opens it up for public comment for 45 days. Then after those 45 days are over....rocketships. Ooooh...you just blew my mindNow I can shop at Real with bitcoins. My goal is on the spending side. To show that you can drop your bank, get paid only in bitcoins and be able to live on that. I did find another way to buy my groceries online with bitcoins but this one would be a bit more convenient.I will contact them directly though to see if they can look into it though.If people are able to live on bitcoins, then more stores will understand that this is a typical payment method and then they will start providing it as an option. Chicken and egg thing...unless you're a business, this is the way you can push forward your side of the equation. That might work.I thought I saw somewhere that PayPal merchants can accept bitcoins if the choose to do so. BOOM I have a bitcoin debit card but have never used it. I have a euro card and only tried it in the US and it didn't work. So I found a local food store that I can buy all of my food online and have it delivered for 1.50. I've been trying some different ways of paying for food with bitcoins and this looks like the best way to go. Unfortunately they only take credit card or PayPal as payment.I know of a few services that will send money to your PayPal account in exchange for bitcoins but when I go to pay at the food site it asks me to log into my PayPal account to pay. Unfortunately it does not just provide a PayPal address.In theory I can just exchange my bitcoins for PayPal and pay for my food that way but that seems like a roundabout way of doing things and my ultimate goal is to drop all of my bank accounts (does PayPal allow you to have an account with no bank account?).Is there a more direct solution?
http://razorsforex.blogspot.com/2016/07/bitcoin-trading-spikes-in-malaysia-as.htmlRussia probably has to do with them not making it illegal to buy bitcoins in Russia. Not sure about Kenya...that looks like it's just finally starting to become known there. Trading volume up: In America On Windoze I download MobaXterm so I can navigate my machine like it's Linux. Where I can open files in vi (I don't need all of those fancy colors). Hopefully by then I can just upload my brain to a hard drive. And fortunately I'll have the bitcoins to afford it. I imagine through most of the upswing to the halving most miners held onto their coins with the hopes of a huge upsurge at halving. With no upsurge they started selling them to pay their electricity bills. Once they're out of saved bitcoins they're stuck with their 12.5 bitcoins per block. At that point the price should start rising just like what happened after the first halving. It was about 2 months later that the rise began. And other than Pirate causing some volatility with his ponzi scheme, the price was fairly stable for those 2 months. If a man is wearing something that turns a gay man on, should we blame the man that is wearing something that turns on gay men? It is pretty much his fault that he was ass raped. Any message containing a certain alt currency are removed.I get these messages that someone sent me a PM. I go to see what someone had to say to me, but I find out it was just a deleted post. Those who own little do not have to worry about money as much. And they are more likely to have more money.Consider owning a bar of gold.Do you live in an apartment? You will need to secure that gold from someone stealing it so it is better to own a house if you're going to own a bar of gold. So now you have a bar of gold in your house. You need to buy a safe to put the bar of gold in. But what if someone steals the safe. You need to buy a gun to protect your home. And paying for a security system for when you are away is a very good assurance that the bar of gold is safe.Look at all of the hassle you have gone through just to own one thing.It is the same with everything you own. You are constantly protecting it from being taken.Nobody can take your fun memories of enjoying your life instead of working hard to buy then protect your stuff. I woke up to bitcoin price of $645. On my way to work I thought...I should go long. I get to work and the price is $654 already. I am glad we were able to let one of the little alts try out a hard fork so we could see what happens. Which is what alts are good for. Testing purposes to learn from for Bitcoin.Apparently you need 100% of the exchanges and miners on board.Conclusion: No 2mb hard fork in the foreseeable future for Bitcoin. I wouldn't bet on it. Like I said...move to Venezuela and just watch as the bitcoin price rockets up. With 1600% inflation rate the bitcoin holders there are becoming super rich!They are also likely starving to death.But hey...to the moon!!! Does king Vitalik still control the real Ethereum? I don't see why not. An ETF on different exchanges. That's why I think it'll go quicker. Each exchange won't want to be known as the losers that couldn't put together an ETF. Your guess is as good as mine. I like Cameron's guess of $40,000 As far as the Gibraltar ETI...I thought there was already something similar in Switzerland. I'm really not a big stock market guy, I just think it opens up to a lot of big investors. Plus I could invest my tax deducted retirement into bitcoins (if I paid taxes). Before the Dallas shooting I saw a Facebook post about how 2 weeks before the shooting there was a craigslist post in Dallas looking for "Crisis Actors".I figured it was just a coincidence so I did a search on craislist for any other searches for Crisis Actors and saw one posted in Miami dated 16 days ago.Here is the post:https://miami.craigslist.org/pbc/cwg/5674249249.htmlLast night there was another bar shooting just a few hours from Miami like the one in Orlando.Could be just another coincidence but I'll be keeping an eye on such ads anyway (https://grandforks.craigslist.org/tlg/5676898612.html) and the events that happen soon thereafter.Yes I do realize that any idiot can just post a craigslist ad and if something just happens to happen nearby they can point to it as proof. That is why I tend to require evidence instead of just coincidences. Ever since the Paris shootings there was talk about the guns coming from the "dark web" using bitcoins. Soon after the EU called for a response. A few weeks later they raided people all over the EU looking for "dark web" activity. They made this huge announcement about how they hit all of these "bad guys" listing such prizes as some drugs, some money and one guy had instructions on how to produce meth on his computer. They hailed this as a great victory. No weapons or anything related to "terrorism" but boy did they show those "dark web" users in Europe to stop using that evil "dark web". I'll be around a lot longer than the EU. No worries. Tomfoolery? I am very open about my use of bitcoins and whom I am. As part of my clearance I never do anything illegal outside of a few traffic violations. The EU is free to watch how I spend my bitcoins, maybe they will learn something and adopt it themselves. 
The price was $660 most of the day then dropped 3 blocks before the halving.Of course, the long year trend showed that the price would be $660 the day of the halving (as predicted over 2 years ago).Price should be bouncing around $680 mid August (though more likely it will be pulled into the $666 hole until there's big enough breakout). Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Hillary Clinton will bring the debt up to 87% of GDP by 2026. This would be devastating to our economy. Please do not vote for the big debt Clinton. Price was $635 at halving. Price now is $655. That is the opposite of down. lolIch spreche ein bisschen Deutsch.Mostly just enough to get food and understand why someone is yelling at me.But at work we all speak English and at home my landlord and his wife both speak English. Though I've been dating a girl on and off who is Brazilian who doesn't speak English but speaks German so we both get by with that.But ya, after 2 years I should have learned more. Is the king of Ethereum in control of the original one or is he only centrally controlling the new one? Price was under $300 in January. I'd say the halving raised the price significantly.Unless there was some other news that doubled the price in the past 7 months? I see two options for ethereums one is cheaper and is almost the same code except for code added by Ethereum's king to save his investment. Should I buy the cheaper version of the same thing or the more expensive? The part about the Winklevoss twins being impatient implies that they are still actively trying to get this to work and by changing exchanges they are showing that they're willing to do what it takes to get it done. As far as lowering the price? No. We already see that people are willing to spend double the bitcoin price for bitcoins on the exchange market if they have a broker handling it. The more people who are able to check a box at work to have some of their retirement go toward a bitcoin investment the higher the price will go. That is a market not yet tapped. And it is huge.It's all speculation as to when it will happen though. They said that it usually takes 2 years from the initial filing. It's been over 3 years.  Very likely. I believe it will take a lot to get out of the $666 range. But the longer it stays in that range the faster it will go up. Beyond $700 there's no safe price like $420 and $666. It all depends on Ethereum's king and what his plans are for his coin. Bitcoin volatility down to 3%. GBP up to 2.65%.The longer the price is stable, the bigger the jump. Last time it went under 1% the price almost doubled within a month.Stability fuels the rocket! Not usually. BTC / PKRBitcoin / Pakistani Rupee 73,399.00 PKR+2,094.00 +2.94% Pakistani rocket ship!!! The fact that they changed to a more friendly stock exchange means they are growing impatient. Also another ETF was filed as well. I would not be surprised if it happened by the end of the year. http://forklog.net/exante-winklevoss-brothers-etf-to-skyrocket-bitcoin-price/"if the Winklevoss application is approved, the bitcoin price can easily rise to 2 and even to 10 thousand dollars." I think I may move to Venezuela.Then I can watch as the bitcoin price goes TO THE MOON!!! I got to learn the itBit OTC process too. It worked out pretty well. I highly recommend it for large purchases. $10 wire transfer fee for incoming dollars and .1% trade fee. Yep, 230 bitcoins added to my stash. Thank you price dumper. House sale money all converted finally after a month and a half voyage from check to bitcoins. Very nice. Just hold that price a few more hours please.
I just saw that you can buy your food from Rewe online. Has anybody ever tried this?Also, I saw that there was a website in Europe where you can put in the website address of what you wanted to buy. I forgot what that was, I'm wondering if I can use this site to buy food from Rewe with bitcoins. Definitely worth the try. One brief moment when I was looking for a job I added private companies to my list. My skillset is wide and not specialized because of how contracts work. They need someone to fill a slot, they'll put you in that slot even if you know it just a little as long as you have a lot of experience and have a degree (and a clearance). So I've been a network engineer, software engineer, system admin, Java/C++/.NET/Ada, etc. A wide range of skills but no specialization in one single skill. While searching for a job in the private sector they tend to look for someone that is very specialized in one skill set, especially at the senior level. I interviewed for several Java positions and one person told me that I was more of a junior level programmer but my salary requirement was senior level. Which was true since I use Java for most positions but I am never a Java developer.Plus the clearance I have, only .001% of Americans have that clearance. Which makes it easy to get a good paying job for any job that requires that clearance. There is certainly no outsourcing of my job to lower paid foreigners. That and my willingness to travel and live anywhere in the world (including war zones) gives me a very good salary. Getting paid $250k-$500k per year is not unheard of for my type of work in war zone environments (working 84 hour work weeks, 365 days a year). That's a lot of bitcoins.I do plan on retiring in a few years, work on something I can just do over the Internet and travel the world. I'll retire a lot sooner if bitcoin goes over $2-3k. Yep, transaction is instant. Which for things like micro transactions at a coffee shop, they are not too worried about a double spend. For one thing the transaction is small, secondly most people buying coffee at a cafe sit down there and drink it. And most companies price a small amount of theft into their business.For big companies like Starbucks you just use the Fold app. Which you fill up your Starbucks card with bitcoins and pay at the counter with that card. Plus you save 20% on your purchase.Most companies that accept bitcoins use a service like BitPay or CoinBase or Pey. Those companies handle the subtleties for their clients. Again...not a problem. As someone who has paid for coffee (actually it was a chai latte) with bitcoins. Not a problem whatsoever.Spend your bitcoins and find out how things work in the real world. It's funny how all these people who don't even spend their bitcoins regularly are worried about transactions per second.If you were actually spending bitcoins you'd see that transaction time is not a factor.  Bitcoin is the only thing I ever use to make retail purchases. Almost any purchase actually. I am at about the 98% point when it comes to bitcoin vs fiat spending. Now that I can buy my food with bitcoins all of my basic necessities are covered. I'm liking the amount of FUD. Hoping for some panic. Just a few days is all I need. The obligatory George Carlin's take on having too much stuff:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvgN5gCuLac  I sold a bunch over $900, then bought a bunch around $850 or so during a dip. Then sold again when it went up again. Then started buying again when it went down into the $600s. Blockchain (tm) coin is also a cryto-currency:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1437856.0 With 500 bitcoins you do this (as an American):Create a business in the Caribbean and transfer your bitcoins to the business. Wait for the price to go up to the point that you can leave the US. Once it's at a high enough price, pay yourself a salary of $100,000 per year. As a US citizen living outside the US over 330 days per year you can exclude the first $100k of your salary from the income tax.You can also pay for things like a "company boat" or "company housing" with the company's bitcoins. You can also charge yourself housing as a business and that housing cost can be excluded from your income taxes as well.Or you keep accumulating more bitcoins while learning to live on bitcoins instead of messing around with fiat. Blockchain is the heart of Bitcoin.Anything else you hear about blockchain is a scam. Kasich is going to be president?!?Oh ffuuuuuuuuuuddddddgggge (only I didn't say fudge).http://gawker.com/donald-trump-offered-john-kasich-the-presidency-1783971713 Price below $666. Is this the end? I don't know what PD is. to himself If I would have to guess, you need zero blockgins to get high at this point. Bullish!
That's the point of the Facebook link. I would probably use something like amount of friends (and friends of friends) to pop up some alerts at the system admin level. I created a MUD back in the 90s that only allowed one character per person and I have a lot of experience stamping out duplicate users abusing the system. It's still early. The Blockchain currency isn't even over $10,000 yet.You can buy it on exchanges such as CoinBase, Circle, BitStamp, BitFinex and many more exchanges all over the world. I hear ya. I almost wrote a whole new board where you had to verify that you actually own bitcoins to post. But it's easier to just go to reddit. This site has become a non-stop barrage of signature campaigners. I know we can turn off the signatures but I keep them on just to see if the person who posted is just an idiot or they are a signature campaigner just posting to get their numbers up.Never once have I clicked on any of the links. I literally held off from getting a debit card from one of the sites because they had a signature campaign so I figured it was likely a scam.Have you ever clicked on someone's signature advertisement on here?*prepares for a barrage of signature campaigners posting pointless crap in this thread* Bullish! Lots of people using Bitcoin? Bullish! That's where the money comes from to get the money to the users. Business owners and contributors will likely want a certain demographic.I don't necessarily want any names, just demographics that attract contributors to give away bitcoins.Imagine a huge political rally happening in one location and someone puts out some bitcoins for all people who are libertarian leaning (based upon their Facebook likes and shares). Or a new band with a certain style trying to get people to come watch them attracting people who enjoy their type of music.Someone giving a presentation on home fire alarms might want to attract home owners.Plus using Facebook, considering the distribution will be limited to a per person basis you can more easily weed out people who created a new account and only have a few fake friends. And you can give the option of posting on the person's wall "Jim Smith just made 50 millibitcoins on Bitcoin Chaser. Want to make bitcoins too? Click here.". Who said anything about converting it to fiat? And we're back to $666  I think I'll take a crack at this.In the most simple terms I will focus on:Facebook login (which comes with user information such as age, gender, # of friends, etc.)GPS location of the user.GPS location of the contributor along with guidelines such as demographics of users desired, amount of bitcoins available, max amount per user, time window and radius. This part will sit on the server.Collection system for contributors to the server.Distribution system from the server to the users.Initially the screen will simply be a beacon type of GUI showing distance/direction to the nearest distribution point along with information on the amount. Maybe just a countdown with a "mining" gif once you are within the radius. Something where you can put your phone away and wait for it to "mine" your bitcoins so you can actually socialize/shop/order a meal/etc. without needing to keep your eyes on your phone like with Pokemon.I could likely do something that simple then expand from there. I get what you mean about local community. My job has always moved me around and I thought at one point that I would like to try to stay in one place and settle down but life is so dynamic that trying to stay in one place becomes a battle in itself. At least in my line of work where the jobs pick up in different places at different times.Though if I was tied to one place due to my job I would probably feel trapped too.The Internet helps to keep in touch with your community of friends no matter where you are. Indirectly...as a contractor. I work for General Dynamics on the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A). An ancient intelligence tool that I helped develop in 2005 when I was in Iraq that is still kicking.A quick google search would tell you the same thing so it's not like I'm revealing anything new.But ya, a libertarian in the heart of the MIC. I get to see first hand how our tax dollars are wasted. And I'll be the first to stand at the head of the line if you're going to throw your money away. CIA? Nah. I wouldn't want the pay cut. Those guys work for peanuts. Working within the system I have finally come to realize the reality of how the US military works.The high ranking officers in whichever duty locations want to accomplish something during their time there. They want soldiers underneath them to help them accomplish things. If they have some of their soldiers being redeployed to another location that is higher priority they start getting complaints of not having enough people to achieve their task. They start pushing their agenda to the right people to make it known that their mission is every bit, if not more important than those other locations. They pressure the media and give out information about how the enemy in their location is "such a threat". They want the world to focus on their location so they can get more funding/soldiers/power. So there is this constant barrage of information about threats to various areas that tend to be a bit blown up to serve the needs of our military.If the US military was not all over the world, it is likely that these so-called "threats" would never make it to the national news. They might make it to local media and newspapers. And they are not really actual threats to the United States.   Now that I think about it, the fact that it would be just like attracting signature campaigners on here is actually attractive from a business standpoint. They are like zombies on here, posting senselessly coming from everywhere for their tiny bits of satoshis. No reason the same can't be done in the real world with real world zombies. Hi OP, I know you posted this 3 months ago and there are SIX pages of posts but I had better answer you without reading any other post in this thread because I'm sure nobody has answered you yet.What was I saying again?Oh ya...signature campaign above me and below me. Pence is riding the coat tails of Mitch Daniels in Indiana who did all of the legwork to get Indiana's government on track. I am certainly not poor. I have a six figure income and have been buying bitcoins since they were $18.It is life's experiences that have value. Not things.I don't understand this statement. I actually sold my house. I sold everything I own except what fits inside a suitcase. That was not expensive. I have a small apartment that I have a month to month lease on so that I can move any time I want if I find a better job anywhere else in the world.The part I like about it is not wanting anything. I see some cool toy or gadget on the Internet and think...wow, that would be awesome. Then I remember that it would not fit in my suitcase. The feeling of want goes away and I realize that the cool thing isn't worth the headache that comes with owning it. And would likely only be fun for a short amount of time. Instead I can go to http://www.google.com/flights and find the next city I want to travel to for the weekend.
Who was this? Can you show us the contract? Someone promised you something? OP's not broke. Move along. There was also a QR code in his notebook that went to http://conficturaindustries.com/.I also saw a fuzzy sign in the background at the bar that looked like the bitcoin logo.It is interesting that they may be highlighting the fiat scam this season which might allow Bitcoin to play a role. A few options:Business/person drops 1 bitcoin, game company puts .95 bitcoins out for people to grab (keeps 5%).In order to get the bitcoins you have to wait while a video plays (advertisement).Charge for the app.Usual pop-up ads.  Check out BitWa.la in Europe. It is very easy to pay your bills via SEPA. I've even paid for speeding camera tickets with bitcoins. There are not a lot of men that actually use bitcoins either. Just a bunch of people that buy, then wait to sell for fiat. Dude has a job, so he's obviously not broke. Stop posting the same thing over and over to get your signature campaigns more money. Get a job like the OP and actually make money so you don't have to post nonsense. Or everyone should stick to the non-aggression principle.  Dude...price halving already happened. Boring in 2016 too.Though it is taking a hell of a long time to get my money out of the bank from the sale of my house last month to an exchange.Banks suck so bad. So so very bad. Most likely an athiest early adopter.It is probably losing him money to troll Christians (which is the purpose of the athiest religion). The fact that the price keeps hanging at $666 so long means that the west has more control over price than the Chinese (at the moment). Chinese are not sitting there thinking...let's keep the price at $666 for some lolz. There is certainly not much difference between Hillary and Trump. The last time the presidency was up for grabs by both parties Trump voted right alongside Hillary for Barack Obama.We actually have 2 Republican governors with proven fiscally conservative track records that will likely be in the debates against the two big government Democrats. They are far from utopian and certainly would not be my first pick as a libertarian but at least they don't support centralization of power. I only lost 1 bitcoin. I am glad that this forum is a safe space where we can discuss such things.#safespace#nottriggered  Nah, they're free everywhere else on the Internet when they're not live. Probably those cam chicks that accept bitcoin  And here:https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlsGoneBitcoin [NSFW]
Well, there were other GPS games before Pokemon Go. I played Ingress for a while.I agree about the money aspect. It would be as annoying as the signature posters of bitcointalk but in RL. But at least people will be able to get RL people to show up places. What if there was an app type of game where instead of just getting points for going places and killing monsters, you go to places to kill monsters and get bitcoins?But the "monsters" and locations would be different based upon your demographic/interests. And people could incentivize a certain type of person to go to certain locations.The app could also access your personal information such as age, gender, hobbies, finances, etc.Imagine you're a Jeep dealership and you're having a huge Jeep sale. You drop some bitcoins right smack dab in middle of your dealership and let the app summon 20-40 year olds that are into outdoors/Jeeps.Or a nightclub instead of ladies night putting some bitcoins inside the club to attract 21-25 y/o females. Even some rich guy could drop some near him to get the ladies to come over.A strip club that puts some bitcoins attracting males with good finances to come in.There could be some sort of beacon that draws people toward the place which might be brighter for more bitcoins, beep faster as you get closer. Maybe have it take a little while to "mine" the bitcoins in the location so you're apt to stick around a bit (and do some shopping/browsing).  bubble Johnson's strategy is to get into the debates. To do that he needs 15% in the national polls. He is already at 12% with little news coverage. Two former 2 term Republican governors re-elected in Democrat states. And you think that Trump would change that at all? He supported the bailouts. He thrives on government interference in the market. The opposite would be to allow the free market to bring us innovation and lower prices in health care rather than a centralized system that can only end in a Venezuela type of tragedy (as centralized systems tend to do).Clearly Trump does not support the free market. Wow.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability"As the word is used in United States constitutional law since Roe v. Wade, viability is the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced, when supported by up-to-date medicine."If the pro-life movement cared enough about the issue they would donate toward scientific research that would allow for babies to be "born" as early as possible. Possibly even upon conception.This way the whole "my body my choice" thing goes out the window. And pro-life supporters can end abortions.The adoption agencies can fund the medical equipment needed to bring the baby to full term and the new parents can pay for their newborn. Comparing Bitcoin to Beanie Babies is trolling (and shows a lack of understanding of a commodity of limited supply).But you do that with all of your accounts so no news there. How many dollar websites do you troll? So...you're not a "Bitcoiner"?  Trump is guilty of the same acts as Clinton. He too supports universal health care. Bitcoin will be $10,000 by December. High for the day was $666.Price at halving was $633.Can't have it both ways "Oh noos! It crashed before halving, Bitcoin is dooouuummmed!""Bitcoin was a super high price close to halving, now it isn't. Bitcoin is dooooouuuummmmed!" Price was $633 at halving.Now it is $647. Awesome. Thank you.
nvm, signed up for bitpanda and see the Amazon voucher option. Definitely giving this a try. I just found out that you can buy food (meat,fruit,vegetables) on amazon.de. I know there are many ways to make a purchase on amazon.com with bitcoins but amazon.de will not accept amazon.com gift cards. I also saw that Coinimal (which used to offer purchasing on Amazon) is now CoinPanda and I don't see anything about Amazon purchases on their new site.I'm living almost entirely on bitcoins and food would be one of the final things for me to stop using fiat. How embarrassing. You posted a block size post in the Wall Observer thread instead of the Development section.Happens to the best of us. I predicted $660 at the halving back in 2014.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=804059.0 Well, AOL was pretty successful for a short time. No reason private blockchains won't have some success too. Some people even still have aol email accounts. About 25% of people lead mainly by trolls and Litecoin people were pushing the theory that the halving would be the end of Bitcoin. Miners would stop mining and due to the difficulty being "too high" nobody would be able to ever mine the next block. Last halving was November 2012. True a lot can happen. We should also predict the price in Trumpistan dollars or Texas lonestars. November halving -> April 20x price (started climbing in January)July halving -> December 20x price (start in September)  QFT your DDOS sucked, we can still post DDOS attack on bitcointalk.Someone's butthurt that Bitcoin's still around after the halving. Some shorts are going to get squeezed. Only $1.14 million per day for mining costs. Quite the discount. I predict that on the day of the halving in 2020 the bitcoin price will be $1666.Edit: Locked due to signature spammers.  Hopefully the block count to halving is not like this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNYnkau-GNw I certainly want it to rise faster, but keeping this chart in mind has helped me to hoard as many coins as possible at low prices. As the chart from 2014 shows the price at halving should be around $660.Next halving the price should be $1630.  Just as I predicted 7 months ago when the price was just over $300.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1292572.msg13508742#msg13508742
Germany hates Bitcoin. So we can all agree. Women should stop having vaginas so men will not be tempted.Good work team. Problem solved. https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-price-slumps-on-eve-of-block-reward-halving/I hope Coinbase still goes through with the halving. Otherwise the price will crash a lot. True. Like houses. No correlation to lot price plus cost of building. The sky is falling.Someone must have inside info that the halving is being called off.Sell everything! Maybe you should develop a Bulgarian Bitcoin exchange that uses bank accounts. It should not be so difficult. Go on localbitcoins and find someone to sell you directly for your currency.https://localbitcoins.com/ad/333166/buy-bitcoins-with-cash-sofia-bulgaria?amount=1000 It's not about the price doubling. It's about getting your funds out of an inflationary currency.If you could use dollars instead of the Bulgarian lev would you?Bitcoin is like that but better when it comes to inflation. And you can use Bitcoin all over the Internet. Should've given the kid the electric chair. I wore some daring dress on the way home the other day and a woman raped me.It was probably my fault for wearing "daring dress". Looks like the consensus of everyone in this thread is that all women should wear burkas everywhere. Otherwise they will be raped because men just have no control over themselves. Forcing any country to do anything tends to imply the use or at least the threat of force.If a war with China is to be part of Trump's legacy count me out. Bargaining table? Bolstering the U.S. military presence?What if China refuses to surrender to Trump's whims?War with China? I did not say that the less prosperity you have, the more prosperity you have. The less things you own, the less those things control your life. The more happiness you have.My mother was a credit counselor. She told me about this doctor couple that came in with debt up to their eyeballs. They owned the expensive house with two new expensive cars and spent money on all of the finer things. When she told them that they can't afford to keep doing that they were shocked because the other doctors had the same lifestyles. She told them that it was very likely that the other doctors were also in debt up to their eyeballs.If those doctors had instead bought a reasonable house worth maybe a year's salary and paid in cash. Paid for reasonable vehicles with cash. Eat at home more. Then they would have huge salaries with no debt, nothing holding them back from chasing their dreams. Focus on living life instead of working to pay for their stuff.For me, I'd rather have a large bitcoin wallet than the latest BMW and house on the beach. It opens up my future to so many more possibilities. True, doesn't have Ryanair or Wizz or those smaller ones. Mainly the flights that are found on major travel sites. Yes, when you order a ticket Bitcoin is shown as a payment option. I've been using the site for several years. The jews in Nazi Germany were doing nothing wrong.  I am American but I live and work in Germany. I agree about going back to America and seeing how the lifestyle is destroying people. The big thing I noticed when I stopped in about a month ago was the constant barrage of advertising. From the airport to getting in the car and after 2 songs some advertisement comes on, to all of the big signs as you drive through a city to the TV ads nonstop when watching TV. Maybe it's just because I don't speak German and ignore all of the radio ads (turning the channel) and they don't have as obnoxious signs for their businesses, and I use Kodi for TV so I never see ads. But I can see why people are so driven to buy stuff. As the youtube video says, you are told by advertisers that buying their product will make you happy. While it might bring a temporary thrill, it is not long term happiness and actually contributes to your sadness in the long term.I'm not a nomad yet, I have a 6 figure income so I have a price point where I will stand up at work and walk out. Most likely I will buy a sailboat and go that route. But my work allows me to choose different parts of the world to live in. I took this job in Germany because I knew it would be easy and I could also see Europe while I'm here. I have my sights on a job in South Korea or Japan next so I can explore Asia. Bump for those that haven't seen this list since the price increase.
http://www.cheapair.com works in every country. I use it to book flights in Germany all the time. Every news article for about 6 months was ignoring Bitcoin (because the price was not exciting) and instead talked all about "blockchain".Banks are creating their own private "blockchains" because "blockchain".It will do about as well as all of those companies that store their files in BitTorrent. Oh ya, none do. If the bitcoin value doubles, then your bitcoin salary is cut in half, then you are making the exact same.  It's like asking if the big retail stores will some day take over online sales in the future back in 2000.In a way, some adapted and did well online. Others withered and died.  Yes, I have nothing to hide. I will gladly hand over my phone which has all of my bitcoins that I own. About .9 BTC.  What would you sell the bitcoins for? I pay for flights all the time, all over the world using bitcoins.http://www.cheapair.comGreat service, and if the price of the ticket goes down before your flight you can get a voucher for the difference (up to $100). Prediction locked in.QFT Judging from the article I now see that ISIS is about to get scammed by some 16 year old.  I looked into the campervan thing when I lived in the US. I would totally do that. I had two friends that did something like that.The first guy just said "f$#% it" and instead of paying his rent, bought a cheap van. He pulled the back seats and turned it into a bed with storage underneath. He added 2 solar panels and he and his wife took off. He would go to national parks and just drive inland far enough and just call that his home for a while. Bathe and get water from a creek and just enjoy life. Sometimes he would house sit for people. It was ironic because his wife collected about $1,000 a month in disability from the military and he collected food stamps. When I ran my budget in my nice house with nice cars, he had more spending money than I did each month and my dumb ass was working 40+ hours a week while he got to chill at home doing whatever he wanted all day.The second lady I worked with in Afghanistan. She was a DBA making good money in Afghanistan ($200k+). I think she got burnt out though. She quit her job and bought an Airstream trailer when she got back home and just took off to see the country. It's been 2 years and she's still out enjoying herself.  Keep us in the loop on that one.Or do it on purpose.Thanks. The last time there was not much movement in price. There was just a lot of talk.Price on the day of halving went from about $12.20 to $12.35.Exactly one year later the price was over $1,100. Minimalism + Bitcoin = happinessI have been living this lifestyle for about 4 years. Everything I own can fit in a carry-on and a backpack (other than a box of childhood stuff at my mother's house). My expenses are about 10% of my monthly income having downsized to a small 35 sqm apartment. I bought a cheap/reliable car, paid in cash (my criteria was something that would last 2 years, good gas mileage and I wouldn't mind walking away from).By doing this I can focus on the things in life that truly make me happy, last year I traveled to one new country a month. I don't worry about money like I used to. I will probably be able to quit my job in the next few years and do something I enjoy instead of just working for the money. And it has allowed me to accumulate bitcoins. Continuing this lifestyle will allow me to see the world and be independent/free instead of having to spend my life protecting my stuff.Bitcoin does a lot to help with this lifestyle as I would not be able to be as mobile with gold, moving place to place carrying large amounts of gold across borders while I can carry my private key easily anywhere. I can always find a localbitcoins seller in whatever country I go to to get local currency.The Less You Own, The More You Have (TED talk)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyKmpyYy14k http://moneymorning.com/2016/06/28/investing-in-bitcoin-has-delivered-an-annual-return-of-82/ Many female rappers expose a lot of skin.Except Queen Latifah because nobody wants that. Bitcoin died after the last halving. All of the miners stopped mining because the reward was not enough, the difficulty was too high for anyone to solo mine so no block was ever filled, everyone stopped using Bitcoin and it became worthless. And it will happen again this halving. Posted in Bitcoin Discussion but it will probably be drowned out by threads about "How do I get free bitcoins!?!?" full of signature posts. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4q8eu9/chinese_civil_code_general_provisions_draft/
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4q8eu9/chinese_civil_code_general_provisions_draft/ http://www.8btc.com/minfabullish! From the Quran:"The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication - flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.""A man committed fornication with a woman. So the Apostle of Allah ordered regarding him and the prescribed punishment of flogging was inflicted on him. He was then informed that he was married. So he commanded regarding him and he was stoned to death.""As to the thief, male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from Allah, for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power.""If he is intoxicated, flog him; again if he is intoxicated, flog him; again if he is intoxicated, flog him if he does it again a fourth time, kill him."  Buy 1000 @$644 They are not subhumans. They are individuals. Humans.I assumed from your statements on punishment that you were muslim. It sounds like their types of rules. Have you considered converting? You would be very welcome. I am an individual human living on Earth.You can try to categorize me however you like to aid in your intellectual laziness. USSR fell, replaced by the EU.Perhaps when the EU falls another socialist system will form. Perhaps this time with the help of the US. Your race to torture humans and seeing certain humans as subhumans says more about you than anything. You may want to re-think your thoughts on corporal punishment as it is highly likely that your obvious instincts to inflict pain will take hold some day and you will find yourself on the other side of the law. Better than seeing 6 figures in your bank account is seeing 57 bitcoins in your Bitcoin wallet. You can compensate the victim. You think you are preventing but it has been found that tougher penalties do nothing to prevent further crimes of the same kind. People who want tough penalties just like the idea of harming others. Over 90% of people in the world are taken care of by someone else. So are you saying that poor people not paying taxes (using government services) should be punished more?Show me scientific proof that one human is not as human as another human. What part of the DNA is different? How can someone be proven to be sub-human?I have studied ancient criminal systems. We are far from perfect in this day and age but we have come very far in improving our criminal justice system. Unless you would like your body hung naked in the town square if you die owing debt to someone.Your focus is too much on harming someone instead of making it so that this does not happen again, and helping the victim. This is about the first time people have voted for decentralization in modern civilization.I am surprised it was the older people that did it.I am saddened that the younger generation supports the globalist socialism. Britain wins today, but loses its future. Your focus is on harming the rapist rather than making the victim whole again.It does not matter what the victim's sexual history is. The act needs to be addressed, not the victim's history. The act is that someone initiated force against someone else, the only thing that needs to happen at that point once evidence proves guilt is that the victim should be compensated along with any feeds involved to find that guilt, and steps need to be taken to ensure that the rapist does not do this again. That is the point where you can judge the likelihood of the rapist doing it again and punish him/her accordingly. If that means time away from society or working to pay off the debt to the victim, that is entirely subjective on a case by case basis.The punishment should also not have anything to do with his/her race, immigration status, favorite football team, religion, hair color or anything else that is entirely irrelevant.And "untermensch" means sub-human. I hate to break it to your screwed up belief system but all humans are humans. I know you have been raised to believe that one group of people is not as "human" as other "humans" but you have been filled with propaganda by your group in order to build a wedge against another group. Stand up for yourself and live your own life as an individual. Stop relying upon your groupthink to get through life. It's intellectually lazy and should be left with ancient times. According to one ignorant person. How about periodic reviews of all women to check their virginity? Surely that would likely live up to your expectations. That way a database of virgins vs non-virgins could be created, if someone is raped you just check the database.Maybe you personally could be the one to check to see if the women are virgins. Perhaps on a monthly basis. Or weekly even.Or maybe we just live in a society where someone's sexual past is none of your goddamn business. The move upwards happened right when the results started coming out.I was hoping I'd wake up to catch it but missed it by about 1.5 hours. Was going to long the price once I had any indication that Leave was winning. Just curious how many companies took up BitTorrent technologies to use for better storage and distribution of their company files.More security, distributed, decentralized. What more would a company want when choosing their file system? A wealthy man from Nigeria offered to put $5 million in my bank account. I'm wiring him money now to cover the fees. I will then turn that all into bitcoins.Bullish! It was my family. I don't mind if they tell people.But I think he typoed multi-billion with multi-thousand.I thought $1/BTC was reasonable if buying in bulk like that. Congrats Britain.
Well well, I am very surprised. Looks like the British grew some balls.Congrats on breaking the chains of the EU. bullish! The question was asked if the man should be blamed.Anyone who initiates force should be blamed.Imagine if culturally, anyone who ever initiated force against anyone became social pariahs. That such a thing becomes so uncommon that it becomes unthinkable. I still have a while before I can get my $150k from the sale of my house to an exchange.It's been a few weeks but on the day of the sale I went to my bank to deposit the check. They were able to process $5k of it in 2 days and the rest took 9 working days before it went through.I initiated a wire transfer to ItBit while I was there in the US so I could set up a recurring transfer that I could execute from a phone call once the check cleared (since I would not be back in the US).After filling out tons of paperwork, including my banker calling various people for help with setting it up, we finished after a couple of hours.Then they had to mail me a PIN which I could use to do the wire transfer over the phone. I then have to mail a signed form back to them to acknowledge that I received the PIN.Once they receive that form, then I can call to initiate the wire transfer to ItBit. I can then use their exchange to buy bitcoins which I will then send to BitFinex where I can margin fund at a very low rate to people shorting.Fiat bank Total time: about 1.5 monthsThe whole time I was sitting there with the banker I was thinking in my head how it would have worked had I sold the house for bitcoins.Guy scans my BitFinex QR code sending me the bitcoins (10 seconds). Maybe wait 30 minutes for BitFinex to be satisfied with the confirmations. Start margin loaning the funds (30 seconds).Bitcoin Total time: 30 minutes 40 secondsBank confirmation times are brutal. Andreas Antonopoulos lays it out very well in this video on how to invest in Bitcoin.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uXAbJQoZlE Sell 1000 at $591. Johnson is pulling votes as much from Hillary as from Trump.He left the GOP because they treated him like Ron Paul because he is pro-marijuana and against wars/crony capitalism. It is a simple thing that I wish everyone in the world would agree to:Do not initiate force against another person.</end> Enjoy your shackles Britain.At least you are connected with everyone else in the EU. I will never invest in gold because a bar of gold is way too expensive for me (over $400,000 for one bar).Who would invest in something so expensive? Anyone can be a Lightning node. The security is cryptography.I will definitely be a node if I can, make some money just for having bitcoins. Apparently everyone is so embarrassed by the large amount of money they spent per bitcoin. It's called Sharia Law.Coming to a country near you. There are literally billions of people who buy/sell dollars each day. They don't go onto the exchange but they exchange goods and services for dollars and they exchange dollars for goods and services.After such a long time and so many people, the price has pretty much evened out. Same with euro and other currencies. There are only small differences between the countries that change the value between the currencies.Once Bitcoin is being used daily by billions of people then it will not fluctuate very much. Kinda hard to vote for 2 different candidates. In November are we voting for the Republican primary candidate Trump or the general election Trump? Australia auction is over. I guess nobody has come out telling how much they paid? Yep, same thing happened with Scottland. Doom and gloom scenarios all over the television. Wash, rinse, repeat. Got it, had my collateral in another wallet.Now Bitcoin to $32,000!!!Good to know though when I bring more bitcoins in. Thanks. Thanks for the help. I went ahead and tested with $500. I now have $500 in my "Unused Margin Funding" tab. I tried to do a purchase with that but it says I don't have enough money.How do I take that $500 and go long on BTC?
Two bad things for Bitcoin in the past few days that may have caused this are the auction in Australia (that ends in a few hours) and the Brexit vote is polling heavily toward the Remain folks after their MP was shot.Could be why the West is leading the bear market, they consider those things as big factors. While Chinese just want to get their money out of Yuan.Potential turn arounds, the Australian auction results come out with a high price paid. And Brexit wins Friday morning.Speaking of which, how do I do a long on Bitfinex? Do I have to have USD on the exchange? I currently have some BTC on there (I just logged in after a few years and saw I had .8 BTC still on there). One world government is best. Maybe Trump can be the leader of the world. All government news outlets will be kicking into high gear to put fear into the voters' heads.Must be difficult to campaign against such a huge media apparatus. Why is it that the signature campaigners don't really get Bitcoin? They're just here to make some bitcoin so they can sell it for fiat I guess.Enjoy your fiat. Worship your government. Go into debt. Buy as big of a house and car as you can afford.  Not sure why I put you on ignore initially. Probably from a keyword of ponzi or Beanie babies but you are bat shit crazy yet entertaining. More use of random bold please! Wow...I never thought of that. Whenever I purchase anything with bitcoins I must always use a full bitcoin. I spent all of my dollars on gold bars. Now I'm just sitting here with 100 oz of gold bars broke as hell.   I always keep an open mind, but I also prefer to see evidence that is not filtered by the media. Until then, I'll go with the story being told until proven otherwise. Thanks for the info. Bah, I should have known better than to post to a thread that is just a bunch of signature campaigns posting the same thing. Something tells me that governments learned a long time ago that seizing peoples' money is quite profitable. There are some things that are easier to pay for with bitcoins in the US (like shopping at most stores and restaurants) and some things in Europe are easier (like paying bills, etc).Most things on the Internet are easier (cheaper) to pay for with bitcoins. If it would shock you that a government (those in power) would do that, you don't know governments (those in power) very well.I'm not saying that that is the case this time.  How can you prove she was a virgin? So where will be the best place to get the vote count for the Brexit? What is the process? If the vote passes I want to be ready to go long on bitcoin  Yes, I receive 100% of my salary in bitcoins using BitWage.I did that last year at an average bitcoin price of $250 for the year.Why would you want your money in a currency that is made to lose value over time?As for stability, if the price is up since your last vacation, spend the bitcoins. If the price is down, wait until your next paycheck. Yes, the minority is usually the one that wants freedom. The revolutionaries in the US were in the minority when they revolted against Britain. Most people were not all that happy with Britain but were not willing to do anything about it other than grumble.But that minority tends to be more willing to act while the majority will just go along with whatever is easiest. The auction already started at 12:00AM this morning Australia time. So any money needed is already out of the market. From past auctions, the price tends to go down shortly before the auction (people are selling bitcoins so they can buy at the auction).If that was the sell off, we're looking good for a good climb at this point. The people never vote for more freedom. Only centralization of power over them.
Shoot for 2.1 bitcoins. That way you have 1/10 millionth of all bitcoins that will ever be created.After that go for 21 so that you hold one millionth of all bitcoins.If you can get there then go for 210 bitcoins. At that point you no more than 100,000 people will ever be richer than you.If you work hard enough to accumulate 2100 you will be one of the 10,000 richest people in the world once Bitcoin is the world currency. [image]denzelboom.gif[/image] Any reason Namecoin is up 25% today?ETH owners fleeing to NMC?  Bitcoin was down a few hours before the hack. Actually the BTC price has been fairly stable since then. Enjoy the ride. And so it ends. The media trying to associate Brexit supporters with terrorists.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/british-member-of-parliament-reported-to-have-been-shot/2016/06/16/a9b988de-33c4-11e6-ab9d-1da2b0f24f93_story.html Since the way down I used to keep an eye on $750 as my long range indicator of the ask level. Looking close to the current price shows just short term sentiment. Watching $1000 seemed like it would be filled with too many people would choose that number so I went with $750.The $750 indicator looks pretty good from here. It's a lesson against centralization. The US did not centralize the whole economy around oil prices. The price went down and the people were like "meh, cheap gas". We did not take over the oil industry and run our economy from that income like Venezuela did.Centralization only works if the gamble the government takes works out. Which it rarely does because politicians. Buy 1000 at $742.10 Looks like $745 is 666 so we might gravitate toward this price for a little while. Chatted with Trump and Hillary over the weekend. They're both on board for converting the US currency to bitcoins their first day in office.They also said they will be ending all wars and scrapping the income tax.Then I woke up. So, has the media done a good enough job of scaring the old people in Britain in order to get them to vote against Brexit?I still doubt it will happen even with news stories getting a bit scared about the possibility. Power tends to not decentralize. Only centralize. Yep.And now back to my usual ignoring of Lambie clones. You vote for Hitler, you fund Hitler, you support Hitler, you troll people who are trying to change the system that put Hitler in place, then you complain about his jackboots. This is perfectly reasonable to you? The pay certainly is great. The government loves throwing away money. If only all of that money was being given to non-tax paying libertarians who are immediately converting it to bitcoins. They would be out of power in a year. Wars would end, jackbooted thugs would be out of jobs and we could move forward with a solid economy based around freedom. Something tells me Lambie is completely supportive of the government taking peoples' money.I've fought this as much as I can, including a run for Congress and much time and effort supporting Ron Paul's candidacy...twice. I submit to the stupidity of the American voter. Time to take care of myself and find freedom in my life and not worry about people that don't want to help themselves. You are literally paying my salary.Thank you for your money. Stop giving the idiots in Congress money. I can't help if those idiots want to give me a lot of money to make American voters feel "safe".I've stopped paying taxes. That does more to stop the war machine than me opening up a slot for someone else to fill. But any gains in "dollar value" made from the economy crumbling will not increase buying value too much. If it costs $10,000 for a loaf of bread and the bitcoin price is $10,737 it will not be that great of an outcome. Though it would probably push the price up as people who still have money try to find a safe haven for their money.And people with dollars will be up shit creek trying to buy a $10,000 loaf of bread if their salary does not also rise as quickly.
As I said "don't produce anything except for war and debt". Though they both tend to go hand in hand. Foreign investors are dumping US debt at record levels at the same time that US debt is at record levels.Who is going to buy our US debt? That's all the US has left at this point. They certainly don't produce anything except for war and debt.http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-securities-idUSKCN0Z2038  75. ETHIOPIA  M1 ~$11.5 billion I don't want to say it out loud for fear of jinxing it but...if we hit $900 in the next 10 days...that would be double in a month.Look at the last two run ups and see how long it took to double. Then look what happened again in the next 2 weeks, then 1 week. Yep, quite active. I am never surprised by a correction after a huge jump. If I was smart I would be part of that correction but I have done well enough sitting back and just letting things happen.It is very demotivating to do any work when I make more in one day with bitcoins than I do with months at my job. The only "wall" is about 50 BTC at $675. Not much between that and $735.Fortunately Bitfinex is a bit more solid. I have done this before with a few thousand dollars on one of the alt exchanges, though the big manipulators probably don't do it this way.I would put in a few small buy orders in order to get about half of what I wanted to buy. Over time so the price did not rise too quickly.Let's assume I accumulate 200 ALTC (AltCoin) at the average price of $5 and want to buy another $1,000 worth.Then I would put in a large sell order, like 100 ALTC at $5 (assume the current sell price is $4.95). Anyone who is looking to sell ALTC sees that there is a "big" sell wall so they put their sell orders below mine so they can sell. They may put their sell order at a lower price like $4.90, then others start to put their sell orders below that until the sell price is at $4.80. I then stick a 50 ALTC sell wall at $4.85. More people put the price lower so that they can sell, the price gets down to $4.75. I put another 50 ALTC sell wall at $4.80. More coins are put at lower prices and during that time I pull the original 100 ALTC wall and move it down to $4.60 (always keeping out of selling range because I do not actually want to sell).Eventually I put a huge sell wall of 200 ALTC at $4.55 and watch as people selling drop their price to $4.50. At this point I start buying about half of the available coins at $4.50. Just enough to slowly accumulate coins and use my $1,000 to buy cheap coins. If all goes well, I can get 222 coins with that $1,000 instead of my original 200. I then buy up the last of the coins below my wall and then pull the wall allowing a rush of buys to drive the price back up to the $5 price, maybe even with a rally driving the price higher (which I can then take advantage of and sell to get back to my starting point).Same can be done in the opposite direction, pumping up the price before letting it drop. Also known as the pump and dump.You can tell that this happens on the larger scale when a huge 1000 bitcoin wall goes up, then when someone tries to buy into it the wall disappears (they don't actually want to sell).Edit: Like franky said. The $666 curse will return. A lot better than your diet. No, that's because the US only accepts dollars (Federal Reserve Notes) for taxes. The dollar was used in over $3 trillion in theft by the US government alone in 2015.Fiat is used much more for crime than bitcoin for now. In a world of Hillary and Trump, we will all be criminals. That is why everyone is buying bitcoin now. Not a Trump supporter, but do you have a source for this opinion? Who in their right mind would use PayPal for trackable criminal activity on the Internet?Criminals are apparently ahead of their time in realizing the best online payment method. Just paid my hosting service with bitcoins.Which service accepts ethereums? https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2214rank.html 76. Guatemala 77. Estonia Price stabilised there on the way up and down due to a small minority using it to make a point or for giggles. Other traders used that to their advantage one way or the other.Volume will be too high for a small amount of people to be able to hold it very long unless the psychological significance is used by traders.
I don't think the $666 number will hold as much as in the past due to this being lead so much by the Chinese. It might struggle to hold there briefly but after that, sky's the limit. Price up 36% since this post.Would you consider being broke if your wealth increased by 36%?  is Bitcoin done? chew chew!!!! See:Socialist health care, socialist retirement funding, socialist housing, wage controls, Obama, Hillary, Bernie, etc.Progressive = socialistEnvironmentalist = socialistUS liberal = socialist Do keep in mind that there will be a lot of propaganda around this. The west will want to hold Venezuela up as an example of a failed socialist state (which is ironic because the west loves socialism). Like all propaganda they will point to the instances of radical mayhem and infer that this is happening throughout the country. Most likely the worst is in the major cities while the small towns out in the country are probably living life as usual (with some more efforts than usual).It is a good example of what will come and helps to demonstrate how to prepare. But if you watch that video of the Venezualan pageant women, it shows a bustling city without panic on the streets.Such panic is a symptom of a bigger problem much in how Ferguson in the US is a symptom of our impending economic crisis. It hits some before it hits others. It's just more sensationalizing to report on those that it hits first. btc/usd is going up faster than nmc/usd Yep, looking at the guy's issue he has a lot of bitcoins but wants to get them converted to fiat without throwing up red flags of money laundering (aka, the government doesn't know every detail of where the money came from). In theory it would work out for us if I cashed out my house proceeds and gave him cash for the bitcoins. But a wire transfer from my government bank to his would throw up red flags.I spoke with BitPay to see about an OTC trade but they recommended I use itbit. I've looked at their OTC platform and they only charge .1% which is reasonable.I will have to tell my government bank to make sure to note that this large deposit is coming from a home sale so they can report to their masters about why I am moving so much money. I will have to inform them that my wire transfer is for the purchase of bitcoins so they can also report that as well. Wouldn't want the government to be uninformed about money flow.I'll be converting 100% (about $150k) to bitcoins. I see no need to hang on to that much money in dollars. I have no near term plans to purchase a home or anything like that with it and I don't live in the US anyway so dollars are useless to me (other than the occasional visit to the Commissary). $9.1 million passed:PANAMABAHRAINCROATIA In communist countries people produce for the good of all. There is no greed. BitWage charges 1%. Biwala charges 1%.I am paid in dollars. My rent is in euros. The exchange fee the guys at work pay is 4 to 5 percent. Plus bitcoin is my main currency. It is made to gain value over time as opposed to federal reserve notes which are built with the purpose of losing value over time. Losing 1% up front does not keep me up at night. I paid my rent in bitcoin. Bitwa.la allows you to send a SEPA transfer. He was ok with that. Now it's direct. Sold my house this week. My mortgage was the last thing requiring me to have a bank account. Last mont my landlord started taking bitcoins for rent. He is happy.Now to get all of that equity into bitcoins quickly. "Broke" dude getting richer by the day. W00t!Imgrocket.gifImg Yep. I don't understand why someone would use BitWage to get ethereums. It's not a currency, it's a single use coin (used for Ethereum apps).I use BitWage because bitcoin is my main currency which I can use for spending.  Looks like we've lost the price point. This will be a roller coaster until we reach $666 or $450/$420.Hopefully we just hit $666 long enough for some rocket fueling stability. Bobbie 18:14"If you're not first, you're last."
I heard there is a great sale on Venezuelan fiat going on right now. Does anyone know where I can buy some with bitcoins?I know I know...don't invest more than you can afford to loose. says the hacker Chase website is down. Dollar was hacked!Has the dollar CEO made a statement yet? I have said it time and time again, when the goal of the global warming alarmists is no longer socialism, then I'll start to listen to their "facts". Until then, it's just the same communist agenda of the 1900s re-branded.http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/another-climate-alarmist-admits-real-motive-behind-warming-scare/ A lot of successful companies saw something great in Hillary. The bears tend to throw out those big numbers to scare us: "3600 bitcoins are being cashed out every day to pay for electricity!!?!!!$!!"Now they can eat their words. So looks like we're holding steady with $1.6 million worth of fiat coming in on a daily basis.After the halving we will not see that amount daily until the price is $900. Bitcoin Getting Smarter Smart Contracts Than Ethereum By Years Endhttps://bitconnect.co/bitcoin-news/172/bitcoin-getting-smarter-smart-contracts-than-ethereum/Rootstock provides Bitcoin miners (the most important, tested and secure mining network worldwide) the opportunity to participate in the smart contract revolution receiving a new revenue stream with their current hardware and electricity consumption. Rootstock also benefits the Bitcoin ecosystem by using bitcoins as fuel to run Rootstock smart contracts. Finally, Rootstock provides Ethereum projects and developers a fully compatible alternative to run their solutions, benefitting from the security of the Bitcoin network.So basically...any Ethereum Dapp will be able to run on Bitcoin's network. Eliminating the need to use ethereums. Someone did that with Bitcoin years ago. No more free phones (that Bush started)? Ya, it did go down 2% after going up 8% so it's probably going to go to $0 any day now. 1.5% volatility is considered unstable?As compared to the JPY at .95% volatility or BRL at 1.1%. Wow...have they distributed over 60% of etheriums too? What's the max amount?Do you know of any place I can pay my phone bill with etheriums? Or Amazon purchases? Look at how many jobs will be lost if Trump wins.  Simplest thing to do whenever someone says "beanie" is to add them to ignore. They are obviously clueless and will add nothing toward furthering Bitcoin.There should be a script set up to do that automatically. Welcome to bitcointalk! I'm giving my niece a bitcoin for her graduation this weekend. I already created an address for her a few years ago so it's easy to just top it up even if I'm overseas. Did the same for her brother when he graduated a few years ago. I finally showed him how to use them a few months ago and he was pretty excited. I'm not sure why everyone is excited about DAO.BitPools has offered this ability for 2 years and nobody ever used it. Sure it's probably about marketing and reaching critical mass but I don't see anyone using DAO. I created BitPools as a centralized version precisely because I knew that the first stage needed to be as uncomplicated as possible for users, a few button clicks. Ethereum DAOs require a whole lot of work to get a proposal through.While I support the concept, I don't think people are ready to use it. There will probably be one DAO used mainly by the developers to highlight its use, but that's about it. All the rest will consist of the DAO owner with his own "proposal" of how things should work in his DAO, with nobody wanting to join. In a libertarian environment, everyone wants to be king.I can also see a lot of people supporting a proposal, but not actually having the money to fund it when the time comes. I've seen this too many times in various projects I've worked on. That's why with BitPools I require people to prove that they actually have the required bitcoin balance before supporting a project. You should change the subject.You have bitcoins that you can spend. You're not broke. poor bank 
Again we approach a narrowing triangle that will happen on a Friday that I get paid...all the other times that happened, the price goes up  Doge people were worse.The whole point of their alt was that it had a dog logo. For years the bears used the argument that "we need an influx of X dollars every day coming into Bitcoin to pay for the miners selling all their coins!" to instill the fear that the price is unsustainable. The reality early on was that most miners were hard core Bitcoin users that supported the idea of it. Now it is probably more of an investment vehicle.Either way, the inflation rate will decrease.I looked at the chart on BitWage and they are converting over $500k in fiat to bitcoins each month and growing. I suspect that by the halving date, there will be as many people converting their fiat paychecks to bitcoins via BitWage in one month as there are bitcoins mined in a day. A stable price is a great thing. It shows that we can hold the $450s no problem, even with over $1.6 million in mined coins being sold each day.Imagine what happens when that number is cut in half. A good guide for figuring out what to do down the road if you live in the US or other nations that are turning socialist. I would imagine that those in the big cities are the worst off. Even if you're not in the big city, eventually those people will move into the countryside and seek out any food available, so even there you're not safe if you can't protect your food.One plus of all this though is that when Venezuela collapses, if they are smart about scrapping the old system and put in property rights it would probably be a good investment to buy some land there. Though it looks it could be more like Romania where the country collapses and the elderly cling onto their socialist past (it's all they know) and the youth embrace freedom. But it still takes a long time for any form of value to evolve in the country, leaving most people poor. My principles have certainly evolved. I used to think the Libertarian Party was the answer. Then I thought maybe the US had a chance with Ron Paul. Then I realized how big of idiots American voters are and how putting any effort into trying to save them from themselves was a waste of time.  It is best that those that are not willing to listen do not get involved in Bitcoin at this early stage.Things like the New York Bitcoin license and other regulations come from people like this getting in to the Bitcoin realm too early.Just know that when the dollar is collapsing and he clings to to debt to save himself from starving while fighting for food he may then reconsider. Or just die.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NeJ3Kg6OUo&feature=youtu.be&t=140 The first bank blockchain appliance will start rolling off of the assembly lines this week.Banks that want to have blockchain can buy this box and put it in their rack so that they now have blockchain. Store your bank's data on your own personal blockchain box instead of the old database technology used before.blockchain That's pretty good. We passed Afghanistan once before during the big run up. Lampchop is some fat chick from Switzerland.  I wonder which house is his. Was it his support of Democrats up until 2008 and his vote for Obama that got you to like him? Or his conservative rhetoric up until he was the defacto Republican nominee? Or is it his higher taxes, single payer health care talk after he was chosen? No, just the Cyprus government running away with people's deposits. As will happen in Greece, and Puerto Rico, and Spain, and the US, and...Gatecoin? Is that a private wallet in someone's cold storage?  I just keep my fiat in Cyprus banks. They will be forever safe there. How would I know which is my favorite until I've had a deep meaningful discussion with each one of them to determine their inner beauty?I'd bang them all though. Stopped reading at trying too hard to sound smart. I spent all of my savings on euros, now I'm broke. So far it's been mainly people DDoSing bank websites in various countries for a few hours at a time.So...people will have to wait a little bit to do their online banking if their bank is chosen that day.
You didn't take those pictures with your phone did you?Pictures taken with a phone usually include a GPS location. Unless you manually turn that feature off. Do you keep your savings in a currency that loses value over time?  Quantum computers = magic.You need more energy than what is in the sun to break the pubkey/privkey.  Kraken added ETH margin trading.So the price rise is a bunch of traders going long on ETH. What was the rating on the moderator? I almost voted Yes.Because NSA. Socialism is a great remedy for an overcrowded pigeon problem. And no more worries about getting your dog or cat spayed or neutered.Beat that capitalism! This. But it does show more people actually spending bitcoins. Over time it would be good to see the amount of conversion to USD vs keeping in bitcoin. As adoption grows it only makes sense that more companies will keep BTC.The most interesting chart is the BitWage chart showing how much is going to pay people in bitcoins. That's USD->BTC.I can't access it at work though. Poor Jeb  They appreciate your votes for keeping them in power. They are willing to bribe you with other people's money to get it. Yes. Government can never do any wrong.  I just don't understand how people like this and like Snowden seem to feel so shocked when they realize that the government is not the wonderful thing they believe it is. They only have themselves to blame for not educating themselves on the world around them.The ramblings of the guy sound like he's watched a bunch of conspiracy YouTube videos and put it all into a single suicide letter. Everything in the letter you could get from watching Alex Jones for a week.If he truly cared about America he would stay alive and collect evidence and expose what people don't already know instead of just parroting what people have been talking about for years. Just like how Snowden revealed a bunch of stuff that people already knew. Those that didn't know already supported what the government was doing anyway, those that did know acted like it was a big deal but they knew it already so it wasn't really a big deal. Meanwhile the guy goes and throws his life away. Well well, it seems they do. I just checked a few hotels in larger cities and they accept Bitcoin.I've known that some hotels don't take them due to Expedia not being a payment processor but the city I was looking at had no hotels available with the option. That was my original question to them (do any hotels in this city accept Bitcoin). I get paid in dollars which I convert to bitcoins. I live in Europe (where the dollar is useless) so I sell bitcoins for euros (at a profit) which I use for gas and food. If I lived in the US I'd spend my bitcoins at Whole Foods and get my gas at Shell stations.Everything else I can buy online (usually cheaper than the local economy) with bitcoins.For my rent I use bitwa.la which lets me send a SEPA transfer to my landlord. The Federal Reserve has a stated goal to make sure that the dollar loses value over time. It has a great track record of doing so.Bitcoin has a built in cap which means that over time the price is meant to go up. It also has a great track record of doing so.There's not much "chance" in things that are built to do something continuing to do so. Especially with a history of doing exactly that.I have every confidence that the Federal Reserve will continue doing its job. Yep, the 1% I paid to convert all of my money throughout 2015 at an average rate of $250/BTC was such a waste of money. Your bot broke. Says the person who would have voted for Hitler and sent him money for his war.
In absolutely zero ways do I make it bigger. That's $600 billion that the government spends each year. I could be taking a slice or anyone else could be taking that slice. Whether it is any bigger or smaller is completely decided by Congress, which is put in place by the voters. I never vote for anyone that will give more money toward the machine.You are more complicit than I am in making it bigger. By voting for those idiots and by funding them. It's a big machine. Over $600 billion wasted every year on making the American public feel "safe". And the American voter just loves giving me money so they can feel safe. There's always a paycheck 2 weeks away. Bitcoin can go to zero and I'd still be fine.  Keep voting for the status quo and the military machine will keep on as it always has. I've met plenty of libertarians in my line of work.You may also enjoy the fact that by living overseas I pay no income taxes.At least I'm not funding ISIS with my tax dollars. Every paycheck is converted 100% to bitcoins. All of my money is in bitcoins. Putting my house on the market next month...I am trying to figure out how to get my money out of dollars after the sale as fast as possible. I love knowing that the idea of more money going to the government means that this libertarian gets more money makes liberals(communists) and neocons heads explode.There is no chance my job will go away with the people you keep electing. And I will be able to buy more bitcoins and spend it on libertarian projects. On piles of government money.Not really (I convert it all to bitcoins), I encourage everyone to take as much money out of the hands of the state as possible.I'm still waiting for the American voter to get smart and make my job go away. I have little confidence that that will ever happen. That's who I work with. I was sitting about 500 meters from that plane when it happened. Sounded like a low flying plane dropped a huge bomb.Took me a few seconds to think it through and realize that the Taliban didn't have planes. Went back to playing my video game.Had it fallen left instead of right it would've hit me. Most oil producing countries have very cheap gas. I recall being in Kuwait and gas was 50 cents per gallon when the US was up over $3. I had to do that once. I called Expedia and they had to get the Coinbase transaction. Then they had me contact Coinbase to give them an address to send to. Just goes to show that there are a shitload of people worried about block size for something they don't actually use. I used Expedia from Europe. Was a gold member for 2 years since I travel a lot. Looks like cheapair will be getting a lot more of my money. BitWage allows you to direct deposit your pay to a bank account number they provide you. That money is automatically converted to bitcoins (to an address you provide them).They say there is no fee but I have noticed that the exchange rate I get is about 1% above the current price.Since most companies allow you to direct deposit your paycheck into multiple bank accounts at different percentages you can choose how much you want converted by creating multiple direct deposits. I went with 100%. I get paid in dollars and live in Europe so I have no need for dollars. http://www.cheapair.com accepts bitcoins for airfare and hotels.vrbo.com also accepts bitcoins.I used a service shipsandtripstravel.com to book a cruise this past year. What are Trump's new stances today? Is he playing socialist or capitalist in his latest interviews? Ahh thanks for the clarification because that's what I was saying he should do.Or just use bitwage. But I'll keep that secret to myself. The fact that you find it easier to spend fiat implies that you have fiat that could be used to buy bitcoins. Fiat that is built to lose value. So you are basically saying that you would rather hold a currency that loses value so that you can spend it instead of holding a currency that gains in value because you don't want to spend it.My average purchase price for bitcoins over the course of 2015 was $250. I was able to convert 100% of my paycheck to bitcoins because I have actually found a way to use bitcoins for about 80% of my spending. The rest I sell for the local currency. Some of us like to use a currency that isn't losing value on purpose.I started getting paid 100% in bitcoins starting last January. The value of my currency is higher now than it was then. The same cannot be said for the dollar. Maybe if you said Expedia no longer accepts blockchain it would have gone better.Or word it in a way that brings up block size or Satoshi.
Sometimes they ask for one. I have a bitcoin debit card that wouldn't work if they ever tried to charge anything since there are no bitcoins on it. They usually take that then I pay for cash on anything charged to the room.And since Expedia no longer accepts Bitcoin I'll mention that one time I reserved a room with that prepaid debit card, got to the hotel and they said it was already paid for. No charge ever went on my debit card. Enjoy. Why have Bitcoin at all if nobody will spend it?The advantage for Expedia is that they have a booked reservation that is already paid for at the time of booking. No need to wait to see if the person shows up for their reservation or wait for the credit card to go through at the end of the hotel stay.The advantage for me is that I don't have to convert my bitcoins to dollars to pay for my hotel stay.At least cheapair.com has hotels and I can use vrbo.com. Went to pay for a hotel with Expedia and there was no Bitcoin option. I e-mailed the site and got this response:For those of us that actually spend our bitcoins this is a big blow. Edit: Looks like it's still an option at most hotels. Not sure why the customer service person (Chris) was so ill informed. Or they keep it in bitcoins so they're not using a currency that's meant to constantly lose value. As far as I can tell that is actually the most sane solution. Don't pay the debt.My idea would be to shut down the United States on July 3rd. Open the United States 2.0 on July 4th.You would still have the same income from the income tax since the police and jails will be handed over to US2.0. But you would be under no obligations that US1.0 had. Thus, no more debt. That's $400 billion per year extra that I just saved you instead of paying interest on the debt.Nobody would ever trust US2.0's credit anymore? No worries, US2.0 has a balanced budget amendment. No need to ever borrow again. The classic Tic Tac Toe game.PM me for my bitcoin address where you can send that $2,500. Now that we have OpenBazaar for the front end of retail how about a decentralized platform for the other levels?Shipping:A network of people who can move an item from point A to point B. Distribution:Connect your OpenBazaar store to a distribution network. People receive the goods and store the items (people could have boxes in a spare bedroom or garage space, etc). When a purchase is made they ship it off to the buyer via the shippers. Distribution centers:Large shipments from wholesalers come into one location then get broken up into smaller amounts and sent to distributors dispersed geographically (possibly using the shippers).Wholesale:People pool their funds together to buy items in bulk that are selling well on OpenBazaar getting a discount for buying more. They have the bulk order sent off to a distribution center. As the items are sold on OpenBazaar they get reimbursed.Being an open ledger, each item can be followed publicly from wholesale purchase to retail purchase.Thoughts? I only use bitcoins to book all of my hotel reservations. I just use Expedia and pay when I reserve my room.A discount for paying in bitcoins would certainly make me want to stay at this hotel. I've been meaning to visit Croatia. Do it and consider me one of your first Bitcoin customers. Whichever, I no longer fund their corruption. I leave those who love it to it.Bitcoin allowing me to be my own bank and no longer rely upon government fiat was a big step. The rest will come. When I used to pay income taxes they took that money and armed/funded ISIS.They were only able to take that money from me because people were ok with it. Because roads and shit. The private police force that was created because the Detroit police force was so bad that even though protection was "free" people were willing to pay for actual protection, and they got it.I couldn't care less whether or not you believe government is necessary or not. There are those of us out here moving beyond all that noise. Mostly thanks to Bitcoin.  In the 80s when they were talking about breaking up the telephone monopoly most people saw no need to break it up because phone service was just fine. Many people were fearmongering about how we would not be able to use our phones, anarchy, chaos etc.One story I recall was someone talking about a city in Mexico (probably untrue) that had allowed competition between telephone companies. They said that they went to one person's house in that city and they had 5 different phones in their house, one for each telephone company because they had to have one for each company because not all of their friends and family were using the same company.Some people just have no imaginations of why freedom may be preferable to the current status quo. My sewer company is Ni Florida. http://www.niamerica.com/Water company is Hudson Water Works. http://hudsonwaterworks.org/Electric company is Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative. https://www.wrec.net/I believe the fire department I used in Georgia was Martinez Fire Dept. http://www.yellowpages.com/augusta-ga/mip/martinez-fire-dept-468251683?lid=468251683Private police force in Detroit:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqlVL26jrCAPrivate highways:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_highways_in_the_United_States Look at the early days of Bitcoin exchanges.MtGox had a virtual monopoly for a long time because they had first mover status. They thrived because they were first and benefited from it. Small exchanges started popping up offering things that MtGox was not offering. But they still were not able to do as well as Gox. Some came and went while Gox continued on.Then MtGox started getting shitty and people realized that they needed to start trying these other exchanges. The other exchanges, fortunately, matured as MtGox finally crashed and burned.Imagine if MtGox had gained a patent on the "Bitcoin Exchange" process. We would have all been screwed. I agree. But it is usually governments that create a monopoly. Monopolies cannot exist in a free market.When the Bell patent on the telephone expired thousands of phone companies popped up. The government ended up giving monopoly power to the Bell phone companies for local and AT&T for long distance for over 50 years (that 50 years where we had the same dial telephones). Imagine how advanced our phone technology would have been long ago had the government not given them that monopoly. My garbage, water, sewage and power are all private companies. So...the idea that by not relying on government those things go away is a failed assumption.There are also private roads and private police forces. I even had a private fire department when I lived in Georgia. One of the highest rated fire departments in the state.I actually did have a problem once with my garbage service. So I cancelled their service and called a new company. Meanwhile the next county over that had a public garbage service was having a big controversy over their garbage service not picking up garbage, people had to complain to the government, the unions got involved, there were protests and hearings. Idiotic. I don't think Trump should take on a woman/minority VP just for the sake of them being a woman/minority.The left just hates it when Republicans try to make history with a minority before they do and they go the extra mile to prevent it. Look at what they did to Palin. She had dozens of media goons following her everywhere, camping outside her house, they did everything they could to make sure she didn't become the VP. They couldn't stand the thought that the Republicans could take away a historical move from them. Same thing with Clarence Thomas. They fought him getting on the Supreme Court tooth and nail. They have to be the ones to get minorities in high positions otherwise they don't want it to happen.So don't worry about gender or race, just pick someone decent. Pick one of the LP candidates and you won't have to worry about that contingent. Wait...you don't pay for your garbage service?What happens when you have a problem with your service? You can't just change garbage collection companies? Currently in use but should be on the blockchain any day now.[img][/http://www.segway.com/media/1170/04_professional_segway.pngimg]
 He made his announcement from that site. AAAAANNNNNNDDDDD   scenehttp://www.drcraigwright.net/homepage.jpg We have a wedge that is closing in on the 7th.Tomorrow is Friday which is when my bitwage check goes through which it seems like every day I get paid the price goes up before I get paid.So it is likely that we will break out of the wedge on the upside on Friday. Kashish would be great for people with insomnia. The Bitcoin blockchain can be used to track ownership easily. nLockTime could also be used. Maybe software on each user's computer that checks the blockchain for ownership. One guy I listened to on and off was Niel Boortz. He lived in her district so he followed most of what she was up to. Not a fan of Boortz but he talked about her all the time. Would there be a way to rent software keys for bitcoins?It would likely require different software for each key company but it would be great if possible.If you only need some software for 2 weeks but a year license is $5000, then a couple hundred bucks for the 2 weeks would be good. Cool, thanks.I would rather pay with bitcoins and try out OpenBazaar. Not from mainstream media at all. I lived in Georgia when she was in congress and heard all the time about her batshit craziness. Cynthia McKinney? The woman who after 9/11 the Saudis offered a donation to New York and they declined McKinney jumped up and said "I'll take it!".She's a big fan of Moammar Gadhafi, she used to camp out on the house floor for six hours when the president spoke just so she'd be seen on national TV. And just about everything she doesn't like she equates to racism.I'm glad she's no longer in congress. She just needs to go away. Could you list your OpenBazaar link in the OP? I see it for sale on OB but there are no reviews yet so it could be anyone. Their 21Inc computers mine bitcoins, 40% goes to the user, 60% goes to 21inc."Why would anyone run this?" You ask. Their response is the vast software network that the computers connect to.I would not doubt it if they take a percentage of every microtransaction.The microtransactions work by going to the 21inc server and then they get combined into one transaction. There they can easily pull bitcoins from that transaction.They initially promised that they had a chip that could mine 10 times faster than what was on the market. This helped to get them the investments. They did not quite deliver on that promise. Interesting theory that Wright's friend David Kleiman (who died 3 days after telling Gavin he was moving on to other things) was Satoshi.https://seebitcoin.com/2016/05/everything-makes-sense-if-david-kleiman-was-satoshi-nakamoto-heres-why/ Trump should pick Gary Johnson as his VP.Or lose to him in November."Google Searches for "Libertarian Party" Surge After Ted Cruz Drops Out"http://reason.com/blog/2016/05/04/google-searches-for-libertarian-party-su  Still waiting on that genesis key. 1. Though shalt not use force.2. Though shalt not deceive.3. Be excellent to one another. The polling booths aren't located in the kitchen. Nothing to worry about. LTC is still around.
Damn manipulators! Probably.In other news, Russia will make Bitcoin illegal (again) and Japan declared Bitcoin a payment medium.http://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-officially-recognizes-bitcoin-and-digital-currencies-as-money That's right...forgot about that one. Something to think about though.The last time Satoshi was wrongly revealed, Satoshi posted "I am not Dorian Satoshi".No such post here. Would it be easier for me to use my German address or my US military APO address for shipment? Sometimes it takes pushing the price so far off of the rails that nobody knows what the price should be. That's when it skyrockets. This could be like the Silk Road drop. Someone who built a currency out of a mistrust of the government puts all of his bitcoins (which are not secure unless you own the keys) in the hands of a trust which is enforceable by government. Drop coincided with Craig Wright outing himself as Satoshi.I still don't believe it, he's been trying too hard to make himself Satoshi.  And the adoption rate is higher than that 10% inflation rate as evidenced by the rising price.In 3 months when that rate is 4% the adoption rate will easily surpass such a small inflation rate. Then 4 years later when it is only 2%... All of the United States is racist? The halving provides fundamental momentum. People need something bigger to rally around believing the price will go to $10-$20,000. People dumping their retirement savings into bitcoin would do that (or at least the perception of it). Winklevoss ETF combined with the halving would be huge. A big rally requires not only timing but also something to rally around (whether real or not).One rally was started with the US Senate legitimatized Bitcoin. The last rally was when China got involved and everyone believed all of China would be buying bitcoins.I think the Winklevoss ETF released before the halving would push the price up over $5,000. Steam accepting bitcoins is a great boost until people realize that it just means people will be spending their bitcoins that they've been sitting on for a while which will be converted to dollars. (a major merchant accepting bitcoins usually does not boost the price). There should be a way to ignore discussions between two people in a thread. You can count on the stupidity of American voters every single time. He needs 1,237 to win the nomination. He currently has 949 locked in. He needs 288 more to win, otherwise he will have trouble fighting things out at the convention.There are about 500 delegates remaining. California being the main one with 172 delegates. California awards its delegates by congressional district so it could easily be proportional amongst all the candidates. Most likely Trump will win the few large Congressional districts in the big cities but Cruz and Kashsish could win a lot of the farmland districts throughout the state. What? Democrats switching parties to vote for the Democrat running as a Republican? Shocking! Added Steam to the list.Haven't used it yet personally, will update when I do.
All past exponential jumps started with the price doubling in the first month.Then the pace picks up quite a bit. This article is advertising Blockchain (tm) coin.Bitcoin Schmitcoin, the real mindblower is Blockchainhttp://bigthink.com/robby-berman/bitcoin-schmitcoin-the-real-mind-blower-is-the-blockchain-behind-it Love using bitwala. I paid my rent in bitcoins using that service and have paid several of those damned automatic camera speeding tickets. I see a lot of good news stories this week with very few "blockchain" stories. This is usually followed by a week of uninformed bad news. Journalists love being contrarian (even though they all do it at the same time). Not really. I'm not a banker or defense contractor CEO. I don't think anyone actually supports Kashish, I think it is just old people that can't see very well voting for him. Kashich? Looks like Trump already thinks he has the GOP nomination locked. Started showing his true colors.He said he'll raise taxes.http://www.dailywire.com/news/5151/trump-oh-sure-ill-raise-taxes-hank-berrien?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_content=121115-news&utm_campaign=benshapiroWants to change the GOP stance on abortion.http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/21/politics/donald-trump-republican-platform-abortion/Says men should be able to use women's bathrooms.http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/04/21/donald-trump-says-transgender-people-should-use-the-bathroom-they-want/?_r=0How can he beat Hillary if he agrees with everything Hillary says?Running a liberal against a Democrat does not work. Look at what happened to McCain. Did this with a SEPA transfer on bitquick once. The guy sent me 180 euro. I saw the transfer go through to my account. I released the bitcoins.2 days later my bank calls me and says the person's account that sent me the money was hacked and that they needed to refund the 180 euro. Nothing I could do at that point. Canada is a US corporation. Saudi Arabia essentially threatened the US with an economic attack over the weekend if we pass a bill currently in the House.The bill would publicly release information about their involvement in funding the attacks on 9/11.And from the looks of it, the US is going to cave to their threat.Now, I am against war and was against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but I see this as an act of war.When we went into Iraq I asked:Did Iraq attack us?Did Iraq threaten to attack us?Did Iraq hint in any way that they planned on attacking us?They did none of those things and yet we attacked them.Saudi Arabia literally threatened to attack us economically unless we met their demands. That right there is cause for action.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3543702/Saudi-Arabia-threatens-pull-750-billion-U-S-assets-Congress-passes-bill-making-government-liable-9-11-related-lawsuits.html Ironically, people called Ron Paul an isolationist as a dig against him (even though he wasn't).Now a genuine isolationist is using it to win the Republican primary and they love it. 2012.Back room rule changes, shutting down the conference when they saw that Ron Paul was winning, changing the rules at the national convention so Ron Paul wouldn't be on the ballot, ignoring the clear voice downvote at the national convention (the teleprompter had the next line "the ayes have it" already typed out and the speaker read it word for word). The party is all about shenanigans. They literally beat up Ron Paul supporters at the conventions among many other things to keep them out. Trump is just as free to gather delegates at conventions as Ted Cruz. Whining because you don't like the rules of the game isn't very presidential.He does not win the nomination by getting votes in states.He wins the Republican nomination at the national convention. He should focus on that. Like all of the other Republicans are.Maybe if he had spent more time in the Republican Party instead of donating to Democrats he would understand how the process works.  He was on a TV show called "You're Fired". Apparently that qualified him to run for the office of president of the United States as the male version of Hillary Clinton.He's also a big fan of Xenophobes who he easily manipulated by saying he would build a 200 foot wall all around the US.He is also unique in that he's a Democrat winning the Republican nomination. The media experts about Blockchain(tm) care not about block size. That is a problem facing Bitcoin! The US Federal Reserve is very interested in Blockchain coin. http://www.businessinsider.com/federal-reserve-speaks-up-on-blockchain-2016-4?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeedsTo da moon!!! Because...slogans. Well, it's all about hope and change.Change we can believe in.Help take back America.Yes we can.
This is my biggest issue with Donald Trump. The idea that America may one day be great again thanks to him. Screw that!I also believe that the terrorists hate us for our freedom.I am still trying to figure out what freedom we have...but one day our great leader will tell us. This says everything you need to know about the Bitcoin price:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hKN9J-fFSs&feature=youtu.be We soon find out if it is made of cheese. 1. Get a job.2. Make fiat money.3. Buy bitcoins. I am releasing a new cryptocurrency called BLOCKCHAIN (tm). This new coin will be a decentralized PoW system with a maximum of 21 million coins.You may have heard of Blockchain(tm) in the news recently. They are referring to this coin. Any reference to the word Blockchain(tm) is all about this new alt coin.It is exactly the same as Bitcoin but since the media does not like to say the word Bitcoin and instead tries to use the word Blockchain(tm), this alt coin makes it a lot easier for them.Here is the code you can download:https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/Give it a try, you may be wondering why it took so long to release this since the media has been hyping it for so long. The answer is anticipation. We have been letting the media think that by saying the word Blockchain(tm) instead of Bitcoin that they are somehow muddying people's understanding of Bitcoin. But in reality they have been talking about Bitcoin the whole time.So the next time you read a headline about banks creating a blockchain or some other article about how blockchains will be used for future tech, they are all referring to this alt coin. Which is also Bitcoin.Enjoy! Just use any bitcoin exchange in Europe and use a SEPA transfer to get the funds to the exchange.Don't use localbitcoins in Germany. Hmm, let me try this to see what the fuss is all about:Wow, that is an interesting title. I did not actually read anything other than the title but I find this as a great step forward for Bitcoin. I think this will somehow benefit Bitcoin in that people will adopt it more and the price will go up. Now I hope that the title gets out to more people so that they will also know about the title.Did I do it right? Is that the formula you use for posting? Am I supposed to get paid now? I'm not sure how this works. Banks are a workaround to using Federal Reserve Notes. Do you directly pay for everything with Federal Reserve Notes or do you use workarounds? Freedom fighters? You mean the Spanish, French and British governments? The good thing about the early US was their escape from a tyrannical government. Then they turned into a tyrannical government (worse than the one they fought to escape). A crime with no law?I use Bitcoin now (not a crime) which will eventually be illegal (government hates freedom).The US basically came into being thanks to the new technology of the printing press. The Internet used to be a great place for exchanging thoughts freely. Pirate radio brought Rock and Roll to Europe.Hell, the initial banks were a bastion of freedom that helped many people out of poverty. Before government interference. Indeed, I have found that freedom lies in the small window between a new technology being released and the slow hand of government that comes to shred any grains of freedom from that comes from it. That is where I live my life. However ever-moving it is. I couldn't care less if other people want to make poor life choices with their inflationary currencies. I get to use a currency that gains in value over time.All that matters is what I am able to do. I can.I have never had my Bitcoin debit card rejected by an ATM. Being able to drop your bank and use an international currency that has a finite amount...I'd say that's quite a bit.Can I do that with ethereums? I better go buy an ETH debit card then to spend all of these ETHs.Or go visit an ETH accepting restaurant.I can use them to buy things at Amazon for a discount right? Websites like purse.io allow you to buy things on Amazon for around 15% off.Sites like gyft.com and egifter.com give you 3% discount on purchases at places like Target, most restaurant chains, most US franchises.At small shops they would rather you pay in bitcoin because they don't have to pay the fees for credit card services. What is there to afford?  With the Bitcoin debit card I can get closer to my goal of dropping my bank.As bitcoin is my main currency, I get paid in bitcoins and spend mostly bitcoins. For places that do not take bitcoins I use my bitcoin debit card.If everyone did this, a store that starts to accept Bitcoin would immediately see a large amount of customers paying in Bitcoin and they would be able to stop paying credit card fees. Because customers are already spending bitcoins.It is the hybrid solution between what we have now and the day when stores accept Bitcoin directly.
Then you pay people incredibly small amounts of money to advertise your gambling scam in their signatures. The trick is...be the house. In the US, to pay for healthcare the government steals from every citizen.A tax on just being alive. Actually...I guess if you don't get it. Don't convert your fiat to bitcoins.Put all of your money into fiat. Use credit cards and get a big mortgage. Buy or lease a car with big car payments. Vote for Sanders. Support deficit spending.Bitcoin is not for you. What part of "spend as desired" did you not see?Adopt the currency that does not lose value instead of using an inflationary currency.Do you tell Japanese to not use Yen because most people have bills? I see a trend here. Price starts going up:"Woo hoo! Moon gifs!"Price starts to fall:"Hi I'm a blocksizetard, here is my opinion on development issues" The dollar has lost over 95% of its value since inception. Inflation is a feature of the dollar. I would rather not lose value in my currency.You call it profit. I call it not losing value. As I said before. For the foreseeable future, if the price is below $420, buy. If it is above, sell.At least until mid April or so. Perfect! You have a job already.Convert your paycheck to bitcoins.Welcome to real money. The amount of time you spend posting useless posts on bitcointalk so that you get a few satoshis a day in a signature campaign could be spent on a tutorial site learning how to do something useful that will help you make many bitcoins.Go here:https://www.upwork.com/i/job-categories/Find a job category that interests you.Google a tutorial to learn that skill.Go back and take the job. Get paid. Convert to bitcoins.Oh, but that would actually take some effort. Bitcoin is all about no effort money right? Brain surgery pays well. You would get a lot of bitcoins from that.Does that answer your question? I live in Europe. Using bitwa.la I can pay my rent and speeding tickets or any other SEPA transfer. Using bit-x I can spend my bitcoins anywhere that takes Mastercard. You can order one of these:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=977486.0 It is different because it is not the magical solution everyone who comes here is looking for.How many threads do you see on the main page right now about "How do I make money with Bitcoin?".Everyone you talk to that doesn't know about Bitcoin thinks of Bitcoin as this money making thing.Bitcoin is money. Make it the same way you would make money any other way. Stop thinking of Bitcoin as this get rich quick scheme and see it for the revolutionary currency it truly is. Great question. I do not have the answer for everyone. For one person they may only be able to learn the skill of flipping hamburgers (which is in demand somewhere). Others may be able to learn more advanced skills.Here is a top 25 skills of 2016 for those with brains in their head: http://blog.linkedin.com/2016/01/12/the-25-skills-that-can-get-you-hired-in-2016/Go to: http://www.google.com and enter "how do I learn <enter skill here>"This is why you learn the skill?yesSome people choose to use inflationary currency. Some people also choose to go into debt and be poor. Not everyone is smart.yesin some countries, yes (see http://www.bitwa.la )yesnot real to you, alternative for you. For me Bitcoin is my primary currency and all other currencies are alternatives. Anything other than signature campaigns and gambling.A bit saved is a bit earned. So save your money by not clicking on any of the signatures of the people posting in this thread. Blockchain article.Not Bitcoin. Hmm, Brazilian real.With the BRL I typed in google Brazilian L and it popped up a bunch of 'brazilian lira to usd' searches.. Bitcoin is more stable than the Brazilian Lira and the price of gold.It is shaping up to be a valid currency. Save your bitcoins to a private key and keep it safe even from fire or flood.
Wouldn't there be a way for someone to set up a server that acts as a DNS that includes namecoin domains?Then you just point your computer DNS to that computer...what am I missing here? My big price jump indicator used to be 7 chartbuddy posts in a row.Thanks Obama. Bitfinex: $414BitStamp: $413CoinBase: $414How's that? Can you tell the difference from ChartBuddy? Once Trump has this Republican primary locked in you'll see his true liberal self come out.He'll talk about how he voted for Obama, how he supported Clinton, how he wants universal health care. He'll be the shining star that the Democrats have been looking for. It was waaayyy off topic.This thread is for discussing block size. Bitcoin is doing fine. The price has been stable despite around $1.5 million per day in inflation paid to the miners.That means there is a daily influx of $1.5 million. That's some decent demand. Blocktards gonna blocktard. You can pay for PayPal items at http://www.bitwa.la Wow...development discussion taking place in the Development & Technical Discussion subforum instead of every thread.That is interesting! Liberals who say they are leaving if Trump wins is about the biggest endorsement he could receive.I don't like the guy but they keep doing things that make me hope he wins. So it is "the latest issues" that have prevented you from buying bitcoin this whole time? Hopefully they clear up the latest issues so we can be so privileged to have some of your precious fiat. yep, good movie In 2140 Sell over $420, buy under $420 At least until any major developments occur. decentralized ledgerFor most people I tell them to think of an excel spreadsheet that consists of an account name and a bitcoin balance. In order to move some balance from your account to someone else's account you need your password which is a "private key". The amount is transferred and the spreadsheet is updated.After that simple concept sinks in I say that the excel spreadsheet is actually a distributed ledger that lives on thousands of people's computers. And the act of transferring uses the power of encryption to make sure that only you can move those bitcoins.At that point they usually ask about where the bitcoins come from, which I then start talking about mining. For that I just say that 25 are created every 10 minutes, that the thousands of computers out there actually run bitcoin and at the same time search for a random number using computing power. If the computer finds that random number it is rewarded with the 25 bitcoins. And that every 4 years that reward is halved, it started at 50, is now 25 and this summer will be 12.5. This is so that there will be a maximum number of 21 million somewhere around 2140.Bitcoin does a bit more than that, but such a simple explanation usually gives someone a decent idea of how Bitcoin works. Yep, I have no idea where I got that number from. Last halving was 2014 so I imagine the next NMC halving is around 2018. BTC/EUR price might go up but it will not be as much of a factor for BTC/USD.But the euro will go down against the dollar.Which is good for me being paid in dollars living in Europe.  It will gravitate to $420 whether it is up or down for another month or so I'd guess.  They last updated it in January 2015. Most people said that it usually takes a year from the last update so I figured it would have gone through.Maybe they shifted focus to Gemini and aren't pushing the political buttons needed to get it through.
Namecoin is about 6 months behind Bitcoin as far as halving right? So we will get a good indication of the price trend by what Bitcoin does the second half of this year. ETH has no limit on the amount of coins.Enjoy your "investment".QED In the US we use the term "classic liberal" for people who like freedom. In the US communism gets a bad rap so those people that support communism took on the term 'liberal'.As time went on and communism wasn't as hated they took on the term "progressive".Now that communism is not all that hated but still has a stigma they are finally ok with using the term "socialist".Once people are comfortable with the term "socialist" then they will eventually go back to calling themselves "communists".Then anyone who doesn't like that term will likely have fled the country if they're lucky or dead. I have some namecoins, I would rather the coins become commonplace than worry about the price. I invested in NMC because I can see it as a great tool for the future of the Internet.Hopefully the .bit domain becomes commonplace. Blocktards...yes, a good word for those who inject blocksize into every Bitcoin conversation. I thought the DOGE fad was over.Or are we on to another alt fad? From Reddit:Note: The OB team has not yet released OB for Mainnet and they strongly recommend we all just hold our horses until it's been thoroughly testedThat said, a couple of us were impatient This morning Shayan Eskandari and I decided to bootstrap a Mainnet and I would purchase keychains from him. Sam and Brian joined in to sell stuff as well (it's their project after all).At about 3PM PST we performed the first live transactions on the OpenBazaar Mainnet with version 1.0. I purchased:    3 SuperBitcoiner keychains from Shayan    2 sets of 2 OpenBazaar pins from Sam    1 can of RedBull from Brian (lol)Shayan subsequently purchased pins from Sam as well.The transactions went flawlessly. All 3 parties received their real bitcoins and will be shipping the products to me shortly.For fun, here is the Ricardian Contract for the pins I bought from Sam: https://gist.github.com/tyler-smith/38bac0fb1bf9a5c478b6Here's an album of a few screenshots I took of the listings I purchased and the resulting completed orders: http://imgur.com/r9l7Xit,UnPXYLn,HvW3ylS,5iVBvhH,ohgkqcaThere's still a lot more testing to do to feel confident, but so far things are going great! Good work OB team!https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/48w17f/impatient_testing_first_mainnet_transactions/ Oh fuuuuuuuuuddddddddddggggge..."only I didn't say fudge" If the vote does not have people leaving it will mean that they have been brainwashed enough that no bullets will ever fly. Propaganda is more powerful than bullets. I wish I could buy peoples' signatures with btc.Oh wait...this whole thread is people getting paid in btc to post "I wish I could buy every day things". I get paid 100% in bitcoins.With a bit-x debit card I can spend my bitcoins anywhere a credit card is accepted.People waiting for places to accept bitcoin are just hoping for a price rise, they don't really care about spending bitcoins. The UK will be bribed to stay.They will cave.It will not be worth whatever is offered. Speaking of alts, I'm going to come up with an alt coin called "Blockchain".That way all of the news reporters that want to downplay Bitcoin and talk about "Blockchain" will be pumping my shitcoin.The standard media formula has become...if it's bad news, use 'Bitcoin'. If good news, use 'Blockchain'.I'm gonna be rich bitches. I remember when DOGE always snuck its way into this thread too.These cute alts acting like they're relevant. Once they release the first DVD it will be available on bittorrent for everyone for free. Selling movies to Bitcoin users is likely not very profitable. Yep, many western nations have a similar pyramid. Japan population "pyramid":They usually look like this: awesome I like Lightning Network because I can host a LN node and earn bits from people using it if they use my node.
The term human may evolve to include all of the upgrades we gain.With more intelligence in the world more things will be answered. Why are we here, parallel universes, time travel, etc.More intelligence is a benefit, not a hindrance. No matter how hard our leaders are working to stifle intelligent thought. There will be the cheap jobs that can be done by a human cheaper than a robot. There will be creativity (unfortunately that requires imagination so some people will lose out on that one). Unless robots can mimic humans completely people will want human companionship/interaction. Not every robot will be able to fix every robot. There will be crew required for the spaceships who can breed and start new colonies. If every job can be done by robots....will we even need jobs?Every need will be taken care of. The lifestyle of today's rich will be the lifestyle of the poorest human. And the richest human will be otherworldly. We've had computers that compete with human brains for decades. It's only made us more productive and created more jobs. Yes, because who profits is the most important thing when it comes to innovation.    Ever used a microwave to cook something in one minute?Why do you not prepare your meal from scratch (wheat, pluck the chicken, milk the cow, etc.)?Are you saying that the microwave turning our cooking time from a half day to one minute has not allowed people to do more with their lives?Look at 100 years ago...all of those carriage manufacturers and horse breeders and horse shit shovelers who lost their jobs because of the automobile (that was mainly reserved for the rich).Now practically everyone has a car that has more intelligence than the rocket that took men to the moon.What do you not have right now that cheap manufacturing could give you?DO YOU PEOPLE HAVE IMAGINATIONS? They are not very good places for sending money to avoid taxes. Especially Switzerland.Places like Turks & Caicos, the Cayman Islands, Belize, the Bahamas and a few others are the best places for that. Ireland is pretty decent though. For the luddites, an excerpt from a fun little book that makes a good point:http://www.jonathangullible.com/translations/UK_Comnt040222.pdf Not just that one industry but all of the industries that pop up because of the cheap manufactured goods.Look at Hong Kong, they have zero manufacturing but are a vibrant economy. The fact that 90% of bitcoin holders bought bitcoins just to "get more fiat money" means that they all have a sell point and there will be very few huge run-ups.But that's ok because it creates liquidity and stabilizes the price so bitcoin can actually be used as a currency. One industry will be...robot industry. Ever seen Star Trek or any futuristic show?People do a lot of cool things. Things that are accomplished because they spend less time wiping people's butts and more time thinking up cool things to do. And with robots...they can do them. So, now that we have technology to create books we never made up for the amount of scribes who lost their jobs? Humans are not used for most modern warfare anyway, other than being the guy 3000 miles away pulling the trigger. People worrying about jobs...there will just be new jobs to replace the old jobs.We used to have people who's job was to copy books by hand. They did not all die when it was automated. Telephone operators used to route your call, then it was automated. There was not a widespread epidemic of dying telephone operators.As technology advances, we are able to do more. And that requires more people.People used to wake up, spend all day either gathering their food or preparing the food or preparing to get through winter. Now we spend a tiny percentage of our productivity on feeding ourselves giving us time for tons of other things.Technology will just ensure that even less of our productivity is spent on our essential needs.  No fan of Clinton but she should not have to release the transcripts of her speeches. She knows they will be used against her just like Romney's speech in front of a bunch of rich people. Those that want to see the speeches just want to use them against her and she knows it.Though if something comes out during her trial about revealing classified information at these events then she will have to. True...revenge against all humans for getting pushed around by a hockey stick. That dude at the end is a dick.I'm sure the robot will remember him. Capitalism is dead in the US. 
The amount of ETHs scales...and scales...and scales...with no limit. With some work, you too can become a better atheist.You can start here:Top 10 Books that Made Me a Better Atheist There are no atheism books? No meetings or conventions/gatherings? No common beliefs which are espoused by respected elders for others to follow during their path to becoming the best atheist they can be? Just the sheer amount of people that are always trying to convert me to athiesm. Learn from Scotland.A week before the vote the threat of losing your benefits will be on everyone's tongue. Everyone is the same? Slaves love their masters. They will not leave. I have some friends that are always trying to convert me to their athiesm religion. I'm just not convinced. But they do proselytize quite a bit. Someone just put a carrot in front of the Ron/Rand Paul supporters.I'll give him one thing, he's smart. He can play the game quite well. I think people will want to see work toward the agreed plan first. We are about 2 months away from the long climb up to the new high.But I would not put it past another FUD drop in price before then. Actually, before the latest block size/Mike Hearn ragequit the price was fairly stable in the $430 range. The price dropped at that point.Now we're back to the safety of that $430 range.From here the price should slowly rise due to the normal factors. I side with FBI because...public forum You do realize what happened don't you?Let's see:Judge orders Apple to change the code to add a back door to their phones.Apple publicly refuses.Apple releases an "emergency patch" to their phones siting a security concern.Hello....McFly....do you honestly think Apple or the government would say "Ok, Apple is complying with the back door fix. Download this patch for the back door code." I think the key to this is understanding that we potentially could have a super version of Andreas Antonopoulos dipping his toes into the Bitcoin world.Andreas is a great public speaker and he decided that he wanted to help Bitcoin so he used his ability as a public speaker to do so and he has been one of the greatest assets and I think him for all he has done to promote Bitcoin.Tony Robbins is the ultimate public speaker. He inspires and informs other public speakers. I just listened to him a few weeks ago on YouTube just searching for inspiring speeches. His hour of power is good. Great speaker.Welcome aboard Mr. Robbins. One does not simply rise past $420 without returning to it over and over for a few days. Going through this thread I have to point out that if Amazon started accepting Bitcoin, the price would not shoot up.Look at the amount of people who have bitcoins, could save 20% by spending bitcoins on Amazon and yet do not spend their bitcoins on Amazon.What in the world would make you think that Amazon accepting bitcoins at the same price would make the price go up?Even if Amazon started accepting bitcoins, they would immediately exchange them to fiat (which would drive the price down). At least with purse.io people are not automatically converting them to fiat. lolSocialism just wishes it was Communism.To be honest, most Socialists have very Communist policies... they just refuse to use the label because the word Communist has been denigrated in the American education system. Have you considered selling these on OpenBazaar when it opens?You still need a server for it to run on but it may make it easier on you in the long run. So arbitrary categories based on some dominant trait that may or not be shared by all family members which are defined by some arbitrary people.Sounds like something I need to waste more than 5 minutes of my life on. 
That is what militias are for."A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..." I don't think even biologists can account for the variety of traits that every individual has. Someone who's parents are two different races who also have 2 parents that are 2 different races...what race does that person fall under? Yep, there's nothing in there that would make me conclude that I am caucasian.What race definition can specifically define who belongs to that race? First thing I would do is liquidate all of my 401ks and any other investment I have in the US (I would probably do this before he wins if I see the momentum going his way).Then I would do one of 2 things.Either renounce my citizenship and move somewhere warm.Or I would quit my job and work completely under the table so that it appears like I have little or no income (as far as the government can tell)...and I would mooch off of society in style under the new socialist in chief. You may want to check into the solutions being proposed in the development forum:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0You may be surprised to find that the devs have some interesting opinions on this. If this is the reason everyone buys bitcoins then we have already lost. The volatility has decreased dramatically in the past few years to the point that several nations have higher volatility.I suspect that by 2026 Bitcoin will be one of the most stable currencies in the world. Looks like we're down to 3 establishment candidates and 3 non-establishment (though Cruz is establishment-light).I just hope Bush, Rubio and that other establishment guy don't gain any momentum. A nation is a nation. There was no specification on size. FTFY Sybil Shepard has the power to take down Bitcoin...she sometimes attacks Bitcoin but it is up to each and every one of us to stop her. To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money  and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it.  Lol...like banks are part of the free market.Try opening a new bank without selling your soul to the government and the Federal Reserve, tell me how that goes. Seems Trump broke the golden rule of Republican politics and revealed that we were not entirely without blame when it comes to 9/11.I have started to see the Facebook posts about "Trump blames America for 9/11!!!".In South Carolina you need to talk up war and the military. The south is very pro-military and pro-war and very anti-logical when it comes to why people might hate the US. People buying ETH thinking it's a commodity with a maximum limit.  When I go from the US to Europe I don't "buy euros". I convert my currency. My company pays in dollars but I have those converted to the currency I can actually use while living in Europe. I rarely buy bitcoins. I do get my paycheck converted to my primary currency though..which is bitcoin.Sometimes I buy euros with my bitcoins to spend in locations that don't take bitcoins. This thread is like what I always imagined the Dev forums were like but with more technical details.I wouldn't know though because I don't hang out in the dev forums.For those armchair devs you can find those forums here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0 It will be an official national currency, but not in a nation that currently exists. Just checking in on the block size debate thread. All solved yet?
I doubt he is much in favor of legal immigration either. At least if you're brown. Group psychology has found that more people will support you when you agree on being against something than if you talk about what you support.So saying "this sucks" or "that's lame" draws a larger crowd of people than saying "we should do things this way".  True, Trump will have enough problems carpet bombing muslims and immigrants at home before he focuses on "bombing the shit out of" other nations. All of the remaining candidates plan to bomb the shit out of your country (doesn't matter what your country is, it will be carpet bombed for being foreign). Except Ben Carson and maybe Bernie Sanders. Everyone else will do Israel's bidding. Define Caucasian. Wow...upgrade = hard fork. Interesting.Or 5) everyone adopts Core with 2Mb and the Core team implements the change and moves forward with SegWit and LN with very little effort. So the Core devs will quit if they have to work with the same code with 2Mb block size instead of 1Mb? Excellent. nLockTimeNow I can give bitcoins to my nieces and nephews with a lock on them (their parents) spending it before they turn 18. Maidsafe is up over 40% today with the highest volume ever. What's going on with that?  He passed the first tax on people just for being alive. I'm tired of trying to read news about Bitcoin and come to find out some dude in his basement copied Bitcoin and now he has some "great new idea!" on how to use Bitcoin's core technology (without using bitcoins).Unless you're writing a technical piece, there's no need to mention the blockchain. Just don't do it.When is the last article you read about the Internet or some Internet service that mentioned TCP/IP? Unless it's a technical article, you won't see TCP/IP anywhere. Even in the early days of the Internet it wasn't brought up when describing the Internet, so why worry about the Bitcoin protocol unless that is key to your article. I look forward to Lightning Network if it works as we all hope it does. Hopefully it only requires soft forks to implement.I'd love to run a lightning node and charge a few bit cents for running it to have a small income from my holdings. Was looking at the wrong numbers. Or I'm bad with math. Maybe I should vote for Bernie! Currently all of my 401k investments are in international stocks and funds. In all seriousness I would actually move my investments back into US companies as I believe that is the only thing Trump will improve. At least before he starts herding muslims and mexicans into gas chambers. 22 counting establishment golden boy Rubio.I only see Cruz and Carson as the final non-establishment candidates other than Trump. Barring Cruz rising over the next week I say screw it...let Trump win. How much worse could he make things? And all Cruz would do is maintain the status quo with mild improvements possibly. Where can I short ETHs? Looks like the establishment is sufficiently splitting their votes while Trump comes on strong in New Hampshire.Results are:Trump 35% (11 delegates)Kasich 16% (3 delegates)Cruz 12% (2 delegates)Bush 11% (2 delegates)Total:Trump: 18Cruz: 10Rubio: 7Kasich: 3Bush: 2  Do they sell gift cards in UK? The law specified that the state would use a third party service (BitPay, CoinBase, etc.) to convert the bitcoins to fiat. Everyone who was against the law tended to skip right over that little tidbit focusing on making up the idea that New Hampshire would be holding bitcoins. Workin on it.
The whole Zika thing is overblown. The next "Ebola scare". Zika's been around since the 60s. The key will be to find out where the microcephaly are coming from. You spend bitcoins on Amazon using http://www.purse.ioI use it all the time. I usually get 20% or more off of my purchase price too. No reason to buy anything on Amazon with fiat unless you hate saving money. I'm a defense contractor. All remaining candidates (besides Carson), that can win, will make me a lot more money that I am making now.The next 4 years I will make bank.Oh, and a lot more people will die. Communism/socialism is used by many people, especially academics. Doesn't mean it's right or should be practiced by people smart enough to know better. I understand that it is a tool meant to centralize power. It is a simple way of controlling the simple minded. But you do not have to embrace it if you know better. Wow, I guess I said a lot.I like segregated witness and hope it gets implemented. It is a safer bet since it's a soft fork. I like the lightning network as presented and hope it works out as well. I think that all of these updates will have more time to be properly implemented if the 2mb block limit is implemented so there is no rush which could cause mistakes to be made.But you are correct in that I am unaware of many things when it comes to the development. I do have some trust in developers making a sound decision hopefully based upon math and logic instead of listening to the peanut gallery turning it into a political process. I upgraded for the last fork and was pleased that the developers came up with a solution. I have confidence that it will work out again.I actually do enjoy political discourse but do not care to get down to that level of the Bitcoin protocol. When IPv4 was being developed I'm sure there were a lot of developer and technical discussions about various bits to reserve for which features, security concerns, worries about running out of addresses, etc. But even though I know all about IPv4 down to the bit level I would rather use the Internet than sit around and discuss the tiny nuances of it. I have confidence that the geeks who deal with it on a daily basis can make better decisions on it than I can. I leave the block size debate back to those that are really passionate about it and I'll go back to using bitcoins. I'm for whichever helps Bitcoin to succeed. So I am ambivalent. I like it as a currency and a payment system. If I can continue to use it in as many places that I currently use it and can use it in the same way then I am happy. It's been going on for over a decade. 2000 people already moved to New Hampshire and with just that small number have changed things for the better. It's only going to get better as those numbers increase. The fact that you used the word Benie Babies (auto ignore for that) means you care not for any explanation I could give and I should not have really responded to you in the first place."If you dont believe me or dont get it, I dont have time to try to convince you, sorry." -Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin classic is Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 with 2mb block size limit instead of 1mb. If you look at the site you'll see that you actually save money by using the card on the site (usually around 10% discount). Sure, it's not for the simple minded. A few clicks with your finger are required. I get paid in bitcoins...so converting to fiat just to go to the store is an extra step. I couldn't care less what they do on their end. I don't care if someone from Europe comes and uses their credit card and the credit card company changes their euros to dollars to go to the store.What matters is the currency I use, and how it can be used all over the world. Great video about the Free State Project announcement of reaching pledges from 20,000 liberty minded people to move to New Hampshire to create liberty in our lifetime.It also shows how many of those participating in the project have been exposed to and use bitcoins.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzN35DA4xboI actually signed up for the FSP back in the early 2000s. The challenge is that the 20,000 people that signed up have 5 years to move to New Hampshire to get active and help bring about positive change toward freedom.I'll have to contemplate what this means for me though. I had not, and do not really plan on ever returning to live in the US and I really don't like the idea that my income taxes go toward things like arming ISIS and the many other horrible things they do. Living in NH, I would be subject to US income taxes so I'm not very comfortable with that. However, a lot can change in 5 years. I could always change my residency from Florida to NH though for voting purposes.But it does look like it is a very welcoming state for Bitcoin and I am sure as more people move there it will only grow. Great news for New Hampshire and great news for Bitcoin. I don't know much about Britain's places that take bitcoins. I was not very satisfied when I visited London. I only found one restaurant where I was staying that accepted it. Everyone has their monthly spending, for the typical American it might be $2-3k. $1k might go toward your housing, $500 toward transportation, etc.When it comes down to it, the money you spend on every day expenses is not much. Let's say it comes down to $1k per month that you spend on things other than the basics. That is all you would need to convert to bitcoins. If the price drops 10% during your pay cycle, then you're out $100 for that pay period. If it goes up 10% for that pay period, you're up $100. But the price rarely changes that much during a pay cycle other than maybe once every 3-4 months at this point. And it evens out.So it comes down to...can you afford to occasionally miss out on $100 or so (no going out to restaurants for a few nights) if eventually you'll be up $100 (yay, spend more when the price goes up...save when it goes down).It is worth it for me to be able to have my foot out the door of the banking/fiat sector and the experience is valuable for showing me how it can be done instead of people theorizing about it.If you're spending fiat, that means you're not buying bitcoins with that fiat. How is that any different from spending bitcoins instead of spending fiat? I'm obviously not a developer but I don't see a problem with 2mb to solve the fact that we're hitting 100% capacity already. Segwit sounds like it will be good too. But I'll leave that to the developers. I'm open to upgrading to 2mb when that comes out to fix our current problem. I'll upgrade to segwit when that soft forks. With such individualized data, the DNA and computers, it's inefficient to try to create some race based upon DNA combinations when a computer can handle the different sequences easily. That's why I say, only if that is the change.Frankly I don't understand why it would need many coders or time to change a line of code from 1mb to 2mb. I can do it quickly, just give me an hour, grep and vi.I don't want to support a hard fork that does anything but the block size change. Throwing in last minute changes along with it is similar to politicians throwing in their shitty little laws here and there with major laws that everyone supports. Specific DNA structures have different physiological weaknesses and strengths. If you define a race as combination XYZ and Y is weak against a cold, and someone else of race ABC. You might have WMNXYZ while someone else is ABCGPY, both different races but both still vulnerable to that disease. If you're going down to the DNA level, stay at the DNA level. Don't try to group individuals on broad factors that will not work for everyone. It is only because of politics that people will not like Classic.Classic is just Core with at 2mb block size limit.As long as that statement is true I will support it. I supported XT also until Hearn added blacklisting code to it.Core with at 2mb instead of 1mb limit is a good idea. That's just math/logic. Not politics.I will be sure to upgrade my node (yes, I still actually run a full node) when it is fully released (as long as there are no other changes snuck in!).
If you took the DNA of millions of people you would not be able to scientifically assign a race based upon combinations. And even then, what use would it have at all?It's just like all of these people watching the Super Bowl yesterday rooting for "their" team, feeling happy when their team won along with the satisfaction of victory. You didn't do shit. You chose a team....wow. You accomplished nothing. The people on the team and the coaches, owners, etc. actually contributed to the win. You sitting at home yelling at the TV did not change anything. You were not part of giving that team of players a victory.Or people being proud of where they live because X famous person lived there once. You're not famous. You didn't accomplish what those people did. You just happen to exist at a location where at another time someone actually did something.  Not a bitcoin giftcard. If you are at one of these places and you have bitcoins you can go to the website https://www.cardcash.com and buy an e-gift card that shows up on your phone. You can then pay for your meal or whatever with your phone.If you only want them to accept bitcoins directly then you obviously only care about the price going up from the publicity. But if you are someone who actually wants to be able to use bitcoins to live and buy things and leave banks and credit cards behind, then this is probably how most Bitcoin integration will happen. Most stores have gift cards, it doesn't matter what system they use, if you can pay with bitcoins for their card then you can shop at their store.As time goes on the process will become more and more streamlined to the point that the store does not know you are paying in bitcoins and you don't know you're using a gift card. Just like how I am paid in bitcoins. My company does not know I am paid in bitcoins, they do a direct deposit just like they would for anyone else. It is immediately converted to bitcoins for me without them knowing. Race does not exist, it is an invention by people who lack the intellectual capacity to see people as individuals and treat them that way.We are all individuals, your ancestors do not define what you do and how you live your life. You do. Stop using some dead people that do not exist as some sort of reflection of your current character. You make your own choices and have to live by them.When pressed to put my "race" on some form I usually refuse but when absolutely legally required I put Native American. Because I define my "race" based upon myself as an individual and I was born in America and I, as an individual, am native to this land. I respect my parents for their upbringing but my actions are my own, not theirs. Nothing my ancestors have done are anything I have done unless I choose to do them myself. There is no pride nor shame for the actions of my ancestors or any race/country/inventor/slave owner/slave of the past who also happens to share common ancestors. I am an individual with my own thoughts and ideals. Second most used wallet, after just being released (is it officially released yet?) does not sound like "crashed and burned". They don't accept their own gift cards? Hmm, I knew it would go up or down today or tomorrow.I bet on down.Good for my long term, not good for today's sale. That way, after they die you can then lump them into a collective group so as to categorize them in your mind to do with as you please. Exactly, and intelligence changes throughout a person's life. So how does one measure someone's intelligence if it will only change? Intelligence has nothing to do with melanin, usually more to do with upbringing and environment than anything genetic. Intelligence as a differentiator is also dynamic as someone can always become smarter, however more difficult it becomes as we age. How does one define a race genetically? There are so many different combinations, how do you specify which combinations are which race?There are idiots of all races. Deal with them as individuals instead of trying to paint a broad picture due to the limitations of your monkeysphere. CoinDesk was recently acquired by another company. Ya, it is probably the volume since I tend to have about $1-2k worth of bitcoins on my localbitcoins wallet and tend to use that as my spending wallet since I can access it at work. Can't access CoinBase or blockchain.info. Had no idea they cared at all about using localbitcoins. Bitstamp, Bitfinex... After localbitcoins blocked Germany I only do a few trades a month now with people I've been meeting for a while. Usually about 1-2k per month, enough to pay for rent, food and a few vacations here and there.I haven't had a bank account here since August. I only recently opened another one because I might possibly be leaving Europe and will need to convert any cash I have back into bitcoins. Melanin does not help differentiate intelligence. It is a physiological advantage that has no disadvantages. Those with less are disadvantaged for not having as much as those with more melanin. CoinBase sent me a nastygram telling me that they were dropping my daily limit due to their data showing that I was selling my bitcoins on localbitcoins. Siting the fact that I would need to register in the US to sell bitcoins. However I am in Europe so that doesn't really apply to me. But I would imagine similar things taking place in the EU if they follow the US lead. Melanin is a horrible differentiator to group people by. Especially since melanin levels can rise and fall which can change someone from one "category" to another.Why not focus more on something that cannot change such as eye color? Sure you can hide your eye color but it does not change.If you're going to be collectivist, at least be smart about it. Yes, I believe this is the path of least resistance from the public and will be what they will do.The result is an ever devaluing dollar which makes a certain virtual currency a good investment. Just like in the US they would focus on the exchanges. But you're still paying.$233 Billion per year goes toward just the interest on the national debt. The 6th largest spending item and growing. By 2020 it will be more than we spend on our military. Or Bahamians, who are also debt free.
Nice. I just work overseas taking advantage of the overseas tax break. He will definitely be remembered in history for sticking that to us. Roads, schools, institutions...yes those are in addition to the $1 million each person is in debt to the government.Those are not even close to our top spending items in the US.Here are the top yearly 6 spending items in the US: Well, that future income stream is your future tax money.  I've been country shopping and read many countrys' constitutions and there are some decent ones while many of them include too much socialism in them (required social programs in their Constitution). I think the top ones I liked where the Bahamas and Costa Rica. I like a lot that Costa Rica has a balanced budget requirement.Though in the end, most countries (including the US) do not follow their constitution.I did like one small tribal nation that elected their leaders based upon rising in ranks by throwing parties. The party had certain criteria like a roasted pig and other such things, after a few of those parties you could become a local leader, after several more you rise higher in rank and the highest ranked person throws lots of great parties. Just an insane way of doing it but pretty sweet. We were better off under King George (less taxes, less oppression/tyranny) than we are under our current government.Oh how sweet it would be to have King George back in charge of the colonies... The US Federal government is now over $19 trillion in debt. That's over $158k per taxpayer.The US Federal government's unfunded liabilities (things the government promised to give out in the future, think contracts with defense contractors, promised pensions, social security, medicaire, etc.) are over $100 trillion which is over $844k per taxpayer.Every US taxpayer is now on the hook for over $1 million, just for the debts and future obligations of our government. That doesn't include the yearly expenses of roads, schools, military, etc.In essence, if you are a US taxpayer, you are $1 million in debt to the US Federal government. As long as you are paying taxes, you will be paying that debt. Plus you are paying for current government programs. The most disappointing thing about the Iowa result is that Marco Rubio got so many votes.Results are:Cruz: 27.7% (8 delegates)Trump: 24.3% (7 delegates)Rubio: 23.1% (7 delegates)Rubio is the epitomy of the establishment candidate. Expect him to rise in NH and South Carolina   March 2015 or else? If Trump becomes president, I believe the next election he would likely receive over 99% of the vote.As well as all future elections too. Good output does not tend to come from stolen money. I decided not to include the Democrat primary because I'd rather not have arguing back and forth but I'd like to use this thread to follow the Republican primary.Today the Iowa caucus starts. For posterity, Trump is up front, Ted Cruz is behind him with Rubio, Carson and others shortly behind.It might be interesting as it unfolds.  Do you send your Federal Reserve Notes in the mail to pay your taxes? Is there any sort of API? I'm starting a Bitcoin only business overseas opening it up for investors and understand that only accepting bitcoins limits our reach. Offering a dollar (other currencies) option resulting in bitcoins being sent to us would be quite useful.I could certainly send people to BitQuick or CoinBase, BitStamp or whichever but the key is in keeping it simple. This. I still look back at the initial transaction message that Satoshi sent with the press release about how badly the credit card industry is destroying us all. The goal first and foremost should be to beat the credit card companies. Using Bitcoin as a currency was never really part of the plan. Hey guys, I heard someone mention something about Bitcoin's block size.Anyone here have an opinion on it? Looks like next week will either be a huge jump or a huge crash. Anything can happen. Do they have "TCP/IP" conferences masquerading as "Internet" conferences and then try to push their private networks as the next Internet revolution?
 That is exactly what I'm talking about. The blockchain is to TCP/IP as Bitcoin is to the Internet.I do not recall a lot of articles back in the early days of the Internet talking about how this new TCP/IP thing was so great. The focus was on the potentials of the Internet. Parallel universes is the worst theory to come along. It is being used to explain everything. May as well just call it magic. "The Internet won't last but the underlying TCP/IP protocol will." -Bill GatesOk, he didn't really say that but that's about as stupid a statement as all of these "I don't like Bitcoin (because media told me not to) but the underlying blockchain technology is awesome" articles.Bitcoin is the only blockchain technology that has over a million dollars of security being pumped into it daily. Trying to use something else is as senseless as trying to create your own TCP/IP network that does not connect to the Internet. It might be useful for experimentation for some specific project, but it will never take over the Internet or even really be of much use to anyone but your small project. So is Bitcoin Classic just Bitcoin Core with a 2Mb blocksize limit or are there other changes like Hearn's XT with blacklist snuck in? You can go ahead and use the word Bitcoin.When referring to the Internet do you ask what people think about the TCP/IP? Not really enough panic to buy yet. Just the whining stage. Yep, in Europe if you're a woman near a train station stairwell you should expect to be raped.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8tLt6bhqUw The title of this thread is Wall Observer BTC/USD not BTC/CNY It's their own fault for having vaginas.If a woman has a vagina, it is too tempting for a man top put his penis in it. Also, the moon is made out of cheese.Fact. Been out a week and what do I come back to? Oh...still talking about block size.Here's something interesting for a Wall Observer thread. So, did Bitcoin need to fork when they added the 1Mb limit? Just curious. http://iusebitcointosavemoney.com/ Those are not opportunities. If you do some research you'll find boats like his for free quite often. I get messages at least once a week about someone giving away a boat. People get tired of paying dock fees and just give them away. I have a friend that got one similar for doing some lawn work for a guy.And for the "dumbass" comment I welcome you to my ignore list. Just addressing your statement that people have to be exploited or go hungry or go without shelter.Being in the US we have more opportunities than the rest of the world, mostly due to more tyrannical governments in the other countries that do not respect property rights.  Or be like this guy who has no job who is richer than all of us.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw It appears that Hearn, who was an early adopter, pulled out all of his money at once making the price plummet.But the price showed stability as far as (adoption in)/(miner out) at around $430. We will slowly climb back to that price after a while. Considering over 2 billion people in the world survive on less than $3 per day, most people can afford food and shelter. Taking a job where you feel you are "exploited" is not a requirement for not going hungry.
May the idea of a blacklist leave Bitcoin along with Mr. Hearn. Added Bitrefill.com for topping up phone cards. Amazingly simple site, I only regret not finding it sooner. Very handy for prepaid phone plans. This sums up the problem that all of the "blockchain instead of Bitcoin", Keynesian, part of the problem people have with Bitcoin. That and the fact that they can't centrally manipulate the value.Inflationary currencies fail. Every one of them. Do you have to be a millionaire to have shelter and food? It says more about you than the point you are trying to make if you actually believe that the only way to go without food and shelter is by working for someone who is exploiting you. One voluntary.One not voluntary. So...voluntary.As opposed to taxes. Does this happen voluntarily or does the rich shareholder threaten to kidnap the poor worker if they do not hand over their wealth? Glad I paid for my cruise when the price was over $450. Well we did see that large movement of old coins a few days ago. Looks like it was Hearn.Once less early adopter to worry about dumping a bunch of coins. Better for future prices. It is probably better that NYTimes readers do not become early adopters and continue with their government currency like good citizens. I think between now and April there will be a lot of volatility.  I had a rather large localbitcoins sale at $430 the day before it jumped up to $450. I was kinda bummed but now I can start moving money to the exchange. Only if they cash out. I still have yet to obtain as many bitcoins as I had with my first purchase.So, in essence, I have made no money from bitcoin. There will be this shitty hybrid system for a while. About 90% of the problems with Bitcoin are related to the part where you go back and forth between fiat.In the end, the only thing banks will be needed for is the go between for a few companies that offer to pay your taxes in bitcoins. Maybe 3 or 4 companies. And banks hanging on to that last bit of life provided to them by the government. But that may be just a few banks. Maybe just the Federal Reserve banks in the main cities. No customers other than these few companies paying a percentage for the tax payments. Re: Real Estate...What do you think will happen to real estate when the baby boomers all start retiring...(which has already started)?Many will be going to old folks homes or downsizing to condos.That's a large amount of people taking their money out of an industry. Just curious if most of these meetups would be made up of people who also speak English. Considering the intelligence level of Bitcoiners I would think so, just asking. I'd like to check out the Frankfurt meetup. You might want to check on the Altcoin section to ask people about it. Governments already hire the poor to kill other poor people. It's called the military. It would be no different without government.
The RBS announcement is bullish for Bitcoin, it is just overly worded in the Bitcoin article.They basically say the stock market is going to drop 10-20% this year so get out now.Doesn't really matter what anyone says...most of us see it coming and bought BTC for that reason. If I won $1.3 billion I would convert it all to bitcoins.Then buy a large island and turn it into Bitcoin Island. The $430 price held strong for several weeks. There's no reason to believe that the price would go below that. I think we just jumped over $450 too quickly for psychological reasons. Our run up to this price was usually $10 at a time for the most part. So $440s is good. Right now the government steals a lot from the rich, steals a lot from the middle class...they're just really good at stealing people's money.But, without government, wouldn't mobs of people steal more? Sure people can come up with their own private security forces but there are a lot of people in this world. If the "majority" wants your money...they'll take it. Sure they might go after easier targets first but eventually they'll go after everyone.Does the government play a useful role in appeasing folks by stealing for them at a predictable pace?I'm not saying it's right, just talking about the reality of it. Why not try producing something useful to other people?You know...contribute to society... You can make a very small amount by taking advantage of some of the low volume exchanges with large spreads.On bit-x right now you can buy bitcoins for $451 and sell for $440. If you sit there and have a sell set at $450 and someone takes it, you turn around and set a buy at $441. Over time you could make a few dollars here and there. Some dude thinks he can make some money from coming out with a catchy named altcoin. Should play in the $440s for a couple weeks. I think it will be a while before that happens. Firefox Or download TVMC (Kodi)  Sounds about right.I predict $666 the day of halving. Everything opens fine for me. I'm not sure of the file requirements for torrents or exactly how Namecoin works but would it be possible to create a .bit Namecoin address, then add torrent information to point to a torrent file somewhere with the full html file along with links to other .bit pointers that could point to pictures, videos, audio, etc?Say I create an index.html file with "Hello World" saved on it. Then I upload the torrent somewhere, call it 1234abcd_index.html. Then in Namecoin I use my private key to add the underlying torrent information to point to that file and link it to helloworld.bit. Then a Firefox plugin could be created to use an installed Namecoin client when the helloworld.bit address is opened which would then find the torrent and use a bittorrent client to open the html file in the browser.Completely decentralized websites. People in China could create websites about how much they hate their government or people in Colorado could create a website for their marijuana store. Screener wasn't bad. Considering it's not an imagery based movie I didn't really care. Sci Fi and visual movies I'll wait though. Early coins moving is good for long term. Even if they sell and there's a short term drop in price it means that there are less huge wallets hanging over our heads down the road. Definitely recommend it. Just watched The Big Short. What did you think of it?These guys weren't the only ones predicting a housing crisis. Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and others. Though they were focused on the Fed instead of the CDOs, but I do recall plenty of bubble talk as the housing prices rose. I even thought myself that there were probably a lot of people with ARMs (my banker was pushing this on me and all of my coworkers were getting them) and when the rates go up...these people might not be able to pay their mortgages.At the end they hinted that the same thing is starting to happen again, basically making the banks look like shit. Overall a good representation of what was going on at the time. I wonder if it will encourage Wall Street folks to start shorting the market. That's why people will think they are clever and get out at the first sign of the price going down. Most bubbles had 2 or 3 down days on the way up. The first down day will be the end of the bubble and people will think they got out at the top. Everyone will be itching to be the first to get out, the one who pops the bubble leaving everyone else holding the bag.
I agree. The US citizens had the option of freedom in 2008 and a second chance in 2012. They chose more government. I cannot rely upon US citizens to be smart or ever support freedom so it is on me to do so for my own life, without them.Fortunately Bitcoin allows me to do so with the money part of my life, the other parts I am coordinating as well.I just find it amazing that people support Trump. I only saw one of his TV shows so maybe he has a lot of fans (obviously since the show went on for many seasons) but I haven't heard anything from his mouth to show that he has any sort of ideology or much knowledge of our Constitution or the concept of freedom. He just seems to spew hate of everything. Which is probably what America feels right now as it crashes and burns so they feel like "he says what I feel". Ya, he hasn't been very happy about oil and Apple this year. Maybe that's why he's glad I'm renting. One person's vote means nothing. Well, I've finally talked my landlord into accepting bitcoins for rent after a year living there. It's not like I come out of nowhere with it. I show them how I can live on it, give them the benefits but don't try to sell them. I just lead by example. Most of my friends think Bitcoin is a good idea but just say they wish they'd gotten in early (like there is no point to it now that the price is higher). My landlord invests in gold and oil and stocks so he likes the idea of being able to invest with the rent I pay him. And he travels to the US a lot so he likes the idea of being able to use Gyft. I think a general election between Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders would be great. Let the country finally decide between freedom and socialism.  Actually, if you have that much cash liquid...sign up at localbitcoins to buy/sell bitcoins for a profit. Start earning money on your holdings. With CoinBase's debit card the whole country doesn't need to accept it. The few individuals that "get it" can switch over now and be a lot better off than everyone else.It's actually better if most people don't use Bitcoin. They're the reason for the mess we're in right now and why we needed Bitcoin in the first place. Interesting interview with a guy who's paid in bitcoin living mostly on bitcoin.http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/01/07/this-man-has-been-living-on-bitcoin-for-3-years/I hadn't thought of asking my friends to pay for the meal then pay them in bitcoins. I usually have enough cash from localbitcoins for that.I actually did an interview with a guy at Vice once but he never followed up. I think he just wanted to get a better understanding of Bitcoin. I have about 90-95% of my money in Bitcoin outside of my 401k and house. I see it more as the main currency that I use as opposed to something to invest in. Having any less just seems like buying fiat. I'm not really sold on the benefits of investing in fiat currency. If the price is going up, why sell? You're basically buying fiat money...which is created to lose value. Don't buy bitcoins just to sell them.Use them as intended. Spend them.Convert your currency, don't buy. The price will probably not rise as quickly as previous bubbles ever again.I'd say about 80% of HODLers are waiting for that fast jump upwards and they want to be that one person to sell at the top. When everyone is waiting to do that same thing, the price will not go super high. What does that have to do with Trump getting the Republican nomination? Trump is friends with Hillary and voted for Obama. If you don't like them...don't vote for their pal in the primary.He is a sleeping liberal (wants universal government health care, higher spending) playing on Republican xenophobia. It is sad that it's working. I tried to connect about 10 hours ago but got nothing.This is not good because I have my namecoins there because...didn't really feel like installing namecoin wallet. Interesting. Pretty shitty law.I did see something about a year ago where they want to change the wording of bank deposits to investments. That way the money you deposit is no longer your money, you have given it to the bank to invest as they wish. If they lose money while investing your money, they will not be held accountable legally. Any links for this? I recall them working on it but have not seen anything since then. We'll probably repeat past trends of going up $10 or so per cycle. I can see the price holding in the $440s for a week or so. His past is an open book and he appears to shift with the wind, ie. he has no principles. This means you are voting for an open book with blank pages. Nobody has any idea what he would do as president as the wind shifts one way or another.  two fiddy But in 2008 Trump would have run as a Democrat because he was a registered Democrat until 2009.He was a big fan of Obama ("I think there's a chance he'll go down as a great president...I think he's going to lead through consensus, it's not just going to be a bullrun like Bush did who just did whatever the hell he wanted") and really hated Bush ("Bush has been so bad, maybe the worst president in the history of this country. So incompetent, so bad, so evil."). Even had some Ron Paul type of rhetoric about how we shouldn't have attacked Iraq because none of the terrorists on 9/11 were from Iraq.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iuj7VMB48o
If Donald Trump had run for president in 2008, do you think he would have beaten John McCain?Or do you think that Obama would have beaten Trump in the Democrat primary?At least we know who he voted for: Great instructional video on how to deal with an airplane landing on the highway behind you because someone was looking. NWO scientists created ships that sink into the water and rise from the water to make it look like they are climbing up from the horizon.And those NWO planes actually land in the horizon when they know someone is watching. That's why the NWO Eisenhower Interstate Highway System requires that one mile in every five must be straight..Here's a picture of a plane landing because they knew someone was watching: Those that revolted were less than 10% of the population. Most people wanted to just cooperate with king George and play nice.They understood the ignorance of the people all too well. Because next year we can quote the person that got it right. Still waiting for this Breaking News story to happen. Almost 2 years later. I tried for years to find a way to keep my money in gold and spend it, the best I found were debit cards that you could use but you had to pay the company a monthly fee to hold and protect your gold. There was the guy that tried the $10 $20 Liberty dollar who would try to convince people to accept it in exchange for products. It was made of silver that was worth about half as much as it was being sold for. The government did not like him calling it a dollar and having a dollar value on it. Demand went up before the marshal's last auction. Meaning...shortly there are no more disruptive bitcoin auctions we have to worry about and we can get back to not worrying about tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins being sold all at once.*Last post in response, I'm here to discuss Bitcoin and ways to further its use. How many PM transactions can your local pawn shop do an hour? Interesting...how much of a discount can I get on my Amazon purchases using metals?How do I send them my metals from Europe for payment? Looks like a breakout will happen around the 6th.The next 24 hours are critical (c)2016. Obama is anti-gun. Smith & Wessen is a gun manufacturer.People are scrambling to buy guys while they still can. There is a number of ChartBuddy posts in a row that is an indicator of a huge jump in price. Was it 7 or 12 that happened in a row when it was in the $230s and began the climb? Finally used my Bit-x card. Pretty decent. Updated the list with my review. Can we see a triangle showing when the price will likely jump one way or another?The $430 range is so last year...  No, I mean the United States of America. Typically shortened to just America.I am offended that you would be offended.Which is also the latest national sport in the US. Saying "New Year's Eve" is offensive to Chinese. Since they have a Chinese New Year that is coming up.If you say Happy New Year, you're a racist. I'm pretty sure the term "New Year's Eve" is offensive.In America they say "holiday". So...all governments come together on the agreement to ban Bitcoin?Bitcoin, the great world unifier. Obama holding hands with Putin and Assad singing in harmony. Doesn't matter. You have to choose a team. There are only 2 and you can't have a different opinion.Kinda like choosing Republican or Democrat.
I'm still not sure which team to support. "big blockers" or "small blockers".Still waiting on the team mascots to decide which is better. what is your prediction for the price at the end of 2016?While I think the price could swing all over the place, I predict a price of $750 on January 1, 2017. You know a conversation is not about technical merits when words like "small blockers" and "cripplecoiner" start dominating the argument.Key to winning an argument without logic:Lump a bunch of people into a group, then attack that group. Usually by pointing out some bad actions of one or a few members of that group. This is exactly the skepticism of the halving that I am counting on to continue acquiring cheap coins up to the halving just like how people were worried about such things going up to the last halving.More time for accumulation. Nobody should have to pay taxes.The government giving away free money has nothing to do with the immorality of stealing from people in the first place. Bitcoin transaction speed is seconds.seconds10 minutes is confirmation time (actual recording on the blockchain).Once a transaction is seen on the network (in seconds), you can be 99.99% sure that the transaction will be confirmed (recorded on the blockchain) unless you are dealing with a scammer who could "possibly" double spend.I have traded thousands of dollars with people in person where I send the bitcoins, they see it pop up on their phone in seconds and we shake hands and go our merry way. Probably too easy to reverse transactions. Send your bitcoins, then someone says they never received it. Ebay has no shipping proof so the transaction is reversed. So...it seems there is some consensus on the blockchain upgrade.https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.htmlCapacity increases for the Bitcoin system    Very soon libsecp256k1 will be used for verification, which speeds up initial sync time by 400%-700% and reduces CPU load for all full nodes.A segregated witness softfork will be done ASAP (within 3-6 months, probably). This will at least double the effective transaction capacity (ie. it is equal to or better than BIP 102), and at the same time it will provide features important for safely scaling even more in the future.There will not be any hardfork for at least the next ~year.To pave the way for scalable hardfork max block size increases (which will eventually be necessary), and because it is already dearly needed, improved block/tx broadcasting technology such as weak blocks and IBLT will be implemented, hopefully soon after SegWit.The BIPs necessary for efficient deployment of Lightning are already in the pipeline and should be rolled out in 2016. Lightning will allow for almost all of the security, features, and decentralization of Bitcoin transactions while drastically reducing the number of on-blockchain transactions that each individual will need to perform. This is expected to be the real eventual solution to scaling. I did a 1:10 leveraged short at $4. I was about to cash out at $3.50 but it stopped at $3.55 and started going up...and up....and up... I went last year. It was horrible.It is an alt coin conference where they do nothing but bash Bitcoin and push alts. I did get to go see London though when I realized they were spending the whole afternoon promoting various alt coins. Not only can you buy things on Amazon with bitcoins but you can get things for a 10-20% discount through http://www.purse.ioIt's super easy to use and saving money is always good. You know what would get Amazon to start accepting Bitcoin?A bunch of people using Bitcoin to shop at Amazon.WHICH YOU CAN ALREADY DO. Yet more people who only care about the Bitcoin price and not the utility of it.You can already buy stuff on Amazon and eBay with bitcoins.Start spending your bitcoins people. It can be used as a currency after all. https://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-cards/walmart/You can now shop at Walmart and pay with bitcoins using Gyft. Unfortunately not with exact denominations.Someone needs to create an app to be able to go into a store, type in the amount on your bill and get a bar code for the cashier to scan. This would probably be the best way to bridge the gap of stores accepting bitcoins if every store has their own gift card. How many gold transactions are possible each day? Something else that can be corrupted and perverted is a little thing called freedom.Some people just can't deal with that.So then comes the whining. There are ways of avoiding morally offensive laws without breaking the law.Bitcoin happens to be part of one such solution. I follow all of my country's laws. Doing otherwise runs the risk of people in uniforms kidnapping me and putting me in a cage while everyone looks on with moral satisfaction. The jews in Germany during WWII were right to follow their country's rules. Anyone who did not obey and tried to flee the country or use their money for illegal activities such as paying to be smuggled out of the country were bad people. And anyone involved in these crimes should be held accountable. It's a micro...what?
Rate hike could affect Bitcoin in 3 different ways.1. They raise the rate by .25 as predicted and the market reacts with worry, fear, etc. and the US economy takes a hit. This would leave investors fleeing to gold and bitcoin. Bitcoin price goes up.2. They raise the rate by .25 as predicted and the market is happy. It is likely that the current uptrend factored in #1 happening so those that were protecting their investments will move back out of bitcoin and the price will go down.3. They raise the rate by .25 as predicted and it sends a signal that the dollar is strong vs the euro. The dollar goes up sending the bitcoin price in other currencies up while USD bitcoin price stays fairly steady.No rate hike and there will be panic. The dollar will go down and the bitcoin price will go up. Yes http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-eye-gains-as-interest-rate-hike-looms-2015-12-16The Federal Reserves rate decision is due at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, followed by a news conference at 2:30 p.m. featuring Yellen. Bernanke suggests negative rates due to the success of doing so in Europe.http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bernanke-says-fed-likely-to-add-negative-rates-to-recession-fighting-toolkit-2015-12-15?link=TDimage_4 Updated the chart.Looks like we're returning to the linear price. I look forward to the angle moving after the next halving. Hmm...I started converting my USD to bitcoins when each one had the buying power of $17. Now they have the buying power of $462.Either bitcoins are deflationary or the USD has gone into hyperinflation.$1.5 million per day going toward bitcoin's "inflation" (which has been steadily eaten up by adoption) vs trillions of dollars pumped into the economy out of nowhere.Along with the fact that the US holds a $19 trillion debt which requires being paid back in USD. The only two possible ways of dealing with this debt is either devaluing the USD by a lot so that the interest payments are manageable (currently the 4th largest spending item behind national defense) or taxing us all to hell. I have safeguarded myself from both scenarios by 1. converting all of my USD to bitcoins and 2. leaving the US and never paying taxes again. I don't mind transacting with third parties as long as I can hold a deflationary currency.I tried doing the same with gold back in the day but the costs of a company holding your gold plus the fees for card transactions were not worth it. With Bitcoin I can hold my bitcoins and not incur those fees. Nice...with the activity of 420. A credit card transaction takes 6 months to confirm and yet people are able to conduct commerce. I don't think there is one thing I've purchased in the past 6 months where there hasn't been a third party service handling the transaction for the company. Those services can wait hours if necessary and still be just fine. On localbitcoins I transfer money from my account to someone else's account in a second. Other than getting your money onto an exchange, just sending the transaction has tended to be good enough for any payment I've done. I've even sent a few people over $10k worth of bitcoins and once they saw the transaction show up that was good enough for them. Of course we had established enough trust by then to make such a transaction possible. As someone who actually uses Bitcoin as a currency. It works. boom gifdenzel version It's looking pretty sweet too. I took advantage of the $0.00 arb. I placed the bet in 2013. I believe 1 bitcoin was worth about $50 at the time.The person running the site was respected on the forum. I would bend over and let the US government take around $400k to avoid being kidnapped and thrown in a cage. The good news is that the long crash is over. Most people were skeptical of where the bottom was so it would not have been wise to invest when the price could continue to fall.Now the market has shown that the bottom is in, people are fairly confident that the price will not go below that bottom and now that the price is rising people can see the potential for a price climb.The price has been too low all year due to the worry about falling lower. We are finally returning to where it should be.I do not think it should go much higher (around $500 or so) but the momentum will likely shoot it up beyond where it should be. But there is always the correction.  If the full Internet is down people will be using alcohol and cigarettes for trade.Next year there will be satellites broadcasting the blockchain so that would likely still be going.http://www.coindesk.com/jeff-garzik-announces-partnership-launch-bitcoin-satellites-space/Unless somehow space gets blown up too. So this small island off of Portugal, Principality of the Pontinha, has been a sovereign nation by royal decree since the 1400s. It has been handed down and changed hands a few times. The current leader has decreed that bitcoin is the nation's official currency.This could literally kick off a lot of things. Bitcoin would officially become a foreign currency for all nations. Equador, which is the only country to actually pass a law banning Bitcoin (which the law only banned Bitcoin from running on its banking network) had a stipulation that it would be recognized if it became a national currency. So by passing such a law...they may have potentially forced themselves to recognize bitcoin as an official currency.I wonder how US will deal with considering Bitcoin a commodity when it is officially a foreign currency as well.http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/12/13/bitcoin-atlantis-currency/Edit: Wow, I didn't think this thread would go on as long as it has. If you actually read the article there are only 4 people in this "nation" part time.
With no internet...what happens to porn?I believe that is the more crucial question. I'm just upset that the betsofbitcoin site disappeared with my 1 bitcoin bet. New Jersey extends bear hunt for first timehttp://www.northjersey.com/news/new-jersey-extends-bear-hunt-for-first-time-1.1473225 Euphoria usually breeds a downturn. If I were a trader I'd be selling (actually I am selling but just because someone on localbitcoins wants to buy). I predict a correction over the weekend, but still hanging over $400 which is all good.I tend not to recommend buying bitcoins to people. If they understand it, they deserve to buy at this low price. If not, they are part of the reason we need Bitcoin in the first place. I told my family to buy some when it was $17 because I wanted them to all share in the benefit but nobody bought.Most recently I did post on Facebook the fact that I don't usually recommend buying but when the price was $235 I told people who were on the fence that they should buy. The price jumped then fell back below $235 for about a week but then climbed from there. I'm not sure if anyone listened. A bunch of people watching charts and trends, some trend analysis guide somewhere says that when this or that pattern evolves, then the price will go up a lot or down a lot.All of these people see the trend form and get their trigger finger ready. When the first guy jumps, everyone else piles on. People leveraging long or short, etc.They stop where the trend patterns say they should stop. Then they sit back and watch for the next trend triggers. I've been playing since January 1 when I bought at $315.Update: holdEdit: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=883213.0 Probably the same reason localbitcoins is blocked in germany. So...it appears that the best way to find out who Satoshi is...is to out various people and have Satoshi deny that the person is him.After a few million people, if he does not respond..then that's the guy. If the price goes over $1k I'll put up a crowdfunding page to get this made into a movie.It's short but I didn't do much description of the action and filler stuff that would make it into a full length feature. Bump in response to the raid on an early Bitcoiner's house:http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9875898/bitcoin-creator-craig-wright-house-raised-police If it's an open source/community thing then hopefully there would be some sort of consensus on which exchange is the best for each area. If it is private then the company could verify the trustworthiness of the exchange.The "software power" is the time we all take to track everything down. The searches and forum verifications. You would still need the identity/residence stuff but if the app handles it via APIs then it is possible that some double steps could be avoided (sending a scanned ID to each exchange, etc.). Somebody set up us the bomb. The price of oil going down stimulates the economy more than anything the Fed could do. So...how do I roll my 401k into a Bitcoin share? It would definitely not be for the typical Bitcoin user. We can figure out how to go to the exchanges and all of that. But with billions of dollars in remittances going out every day there are a lot of people that don't know. A simple app that saves them 5-10% would catch on quick.You don't have an exchange locally? Or localbitcoins? There are all sorts of companies trying to make remittance using Bitcoin work. The thing is, you can already do remittance but it takes some steps. Steps can be handled by the power of software.Something simple where you choose your sending country and receiving country, then it can find corresponding exchanges and the requirements by each exchange to create an account and get validated. Behind the scenes it sets you up with an account and makes everything transparent for the user. boom gif I would think he is talking about something like this: https://projecteuler.net/But with Bitcoin prizes at the end of each problem.The difficulty would be ensuring that it is a new person solving the problems and being rewarded otherwise someone just keeps solving the problems over and over getting the bitcoins. And it would likely go to math geeks who already know the math. Or team up with Coinbase to offer banking services such as direct deposit and debit cards using your Bitcoin balance.
Dollar value of Bitcoin should go up due to the dollar losing value in the past day.  So...some price movement this weekend. this So...good time to buy dollars on the dip? Or will euro bubble? Should I hodl euros? Random number generator. 1. Price increase will begin in April.2. Price will be at least double what the price is at the start of April by the end of the year but will not reach the all time high.3. Construction will begin on the world's first seastead and confirm that the currency of the seastead will be bitcoins.4. At least 1000 new alt coins will be created.5. The Winklevoss ETF will go public. Don't install the version of XT with the tracking list included. I've been thinking about this. At first I thought it was some American high school kid just trying to make money from signature drives when they could just as easily go get a paper route and make a lot more money and convert it to bitcoins.But I recently learned that there are 2 billion people making less than $2 per day. Though most of those people making that little likely do not have Internet access, but if a small percentage of them are able to get Internet access and do some menial tasks for bitcoins it could help a lot of people.I come across several ways of making money from bitcoins but the time spent and the low return is just not worth it. Even if it's a few hundred dollars a month.I once bought an Amazon gift card using purse.io at 20% discount then sold that gift card on ebay at an extra 5% just to see if there was potential to make money that way.But on a $50 card I made $12.50 minus ebay fees which put it closer to making $5-$10. And I had to deal with the ebay buyer who gave me the wrong address and was complaining that it had not arrived so I had to take the time to sort that all out. Plus the time to set up the sale. (now purse.io does not allow buying gift cards FYI). Totally not worth the effort for me. But some kid in some poor country with Internet access could do it no problem. Maybe not with a gift card but any other item that will likely be purchased on ebay that can be purchased on Amazon. I never even had to be in possession of the item. I just shipped directly. Haven't used them yet. Looks like they buy used gift cards and sell them so there's probably potential for abuse by the individuals. They do offer a guarantee though.Supposedly they're coming out with an app which would be pretty cool. You can pay with bitcoins now though. What do you usually do to protect your dollar from devaluing against the euro or other currencies?Just do that. I see, I thought you were referring to Roger Ver's new Bitcoin Forum. Roger Ver created RBF I believe. Apparently he did not like criticisms of his new forum on his old forum. Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon. Original price was $1800, Amazon discounted it to $1400. I got it for just over $1200. hold I bought a laptop from Amazon via Purse.io, got 10% off. Might want to check to see if the laptop you're buying is available there as well. As you scroll down just look at the amount of posts of the user. Anything less than 10, just click ignore. Cleans things up a lot. This explains the price jump pretty well.https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-trading-blue-corner/It broke to the upside. Look for a top of $350 in the near future.I'd put the price stabilizing back at $333 again eventually. Update: Just used bitwa.la to pay my rent. Pretty sweet site for those in Europe. Review added to the OP. If you are referring to me then, yes I'm working on something. Not so much discarded tires or abandoned anything. Should be incorporated this month and begin actual building in the next few months.No, we're not working on starting a full nation. Baby steps first.
I tend to warn people away from getting an ANX card as the 5% fee is hidden. It was my first Bitcoin debit card. Since it is already loaded I have it as a backup.The inconveniences of Bitcoin almost always come along when dealing with the fiat world. I paid about $40 for my ANX card. And they charge a 5% fee to load it (which I found out later). $10 is tiny compared to most prepaid cards.They will need to charge a fee though, prepaid cards all have fees that the credit card company charges for using their service. I use it for currency. Two weeks of stability means that I am spending what came in at my last paycheck.Shooting up or down requires that I adjust my spending habits accordingly. Good for use as a currency. Could be due to using the American site but I bought a $1700 laptop there with (I think) a 15% discount. I did start at 50% to see if anyone would take it, and I wasn't in any rush, but I had to bring the discount down.As for speed...usually if it's under 20% discount it'll get filled within a few hours (again, for US purchases). I always default to 20%. I'm curious if people who actually know about Purse.io still actually pay full price for things on Amazon when you could be getting your purchase at a 20% discount.I'd like to know your reasons why. For my friends and family I understand because they're scared of this "bitcoin" thing, but for those who use Bitcoin, why would you not?If you don't buy things on Amazon...not really asking you anything here. You don't actually pay your taxes with dollars.Have you ever stuffed an envelope with dollars and sent it to the IRS? Or did you use a bank or other third party service to pay it?Why not just use a third party service to pay your taxes with bitcoins like you do with dollars? The fact that you have locked bitcoins and can prove it via a signed signature, I can see it being used as collateral for a loan if it came to an emergency situation where you needed money quickly.The link provides some good examples other than savings.Escrow, time-locked refunds, Two-factor wallets, Payment Channels, Trustless Payments for Publishing Data...I like the combinations with multi-sig. You could set up a multi-sig time lock for inheritance in case you die. Allow for spending by yourself immediately but after 5-10 years a third party is allowed to spend. account?It is per public key as far as I'm aware. Very strange that this user went from articulate English in the past to this.How much does a legendary account go for these days? I'm genuinely curious. The OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY could potentially be implemented this year. This update allows for many things including the ability to lock your funds from being spent until some future date.Some uses here:https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki#MotivationSo, imagine the many people who are hodling right now instead actually locked their bitcoins for 1, 5 or even 10 years. This would dramatically decrease the supply and ensure that during the huge price rises people aren't pulling their coins out of cold storage out of impulse to "cash out".I would certainly put about 80% of my funds into a locked state due to long term goals. It is much more secure than cold storage. I also wish I had this opportunity when giving bitcoin as a gift to my nieces and nephews, I would have locked it until they turned 18. One sister already cashed her kid's bitcoin out and put the money in her kid's savings account. My brother wants to do the same thing with his sons, cash it out and let the kids spend the dollars.  The price certainly did begin its rise after the halving and everyone realized Bitcoin wasn't going to crash and burn as many had predicted.The theory being that when the reward was halved, a majority of the miners would stop mining and the few remaining miners would never be able to solve the next block due to the "high" difficulty.I believe the price was kept low preceding the halving due to concerns of the unknown. This time around we do not have such concerns so the price will not be kept down before the next halving. The market seems to feel secure with $333 at the moment and the price is gravitating toward it like it was toward $230 for the second half of summer.This is fine since we would end the year up and be solidly out of the bear market for the year with 2016 being the year of Bitcoin. I agree, there is more talk about personality and agendas than actual discussion of development. The former can more easily be skewed. Math actually contains real answers. I have the ANX card. Kinda sucks because you can just pre-load it and it costs 5%. And pre-loading takes a few days. Or even better, make sure they are all middle class like the crazy Anacyclosis cult believes."mission statement is to persuade all people that the welfare of the middle class should be the highest law so that democracy may continue forever""The forced redistribution of wealth is probably the most obvious idea to restore the middle class."Why would I bring this cult up?"Izabella Kaminska is a member of the board of directors. She is a financial and technology reporter for FT Alphaville. She holds an BA in Ancient History from University College London (UCL) and an MA in Journalism from the (then) London College of Printing. Izabella joined the board of directors in June 2015." Hmm...is there anyone on that planet that is poor? They may need to be helped. We should spend trillions to get there to help them. I get my euros by selling bitcoins via localbitcoins. I can see them cracking down on people like me trying to lump us in with terrorists.It's such a better way to get euros than going through banks. I might have to get my landlord to finally take bitcoins for rent instead of counting on localbitcoin sales. Bitcoin price is skipping. Someone kick it. I always answer native American.I am an individual. I am not defined by someone else including my parents or any other person that lived before them.Since I was born in America, as an individual this is my native land. Thus I am a native American.
Bitcoin was made so that this type of collectivism can be restrained to deranged individuals such as the OP instead of giving power to centralized governments with such deranged beliefs. How do you know they're muslims? America is not the world, prostitution is legal in some form or another throughout most of the world. Thus, not "criminal activity".You might be able to set something up on OpenBazaar at some point. I feel that it is better to just move forward without worrying about others enlightening themselves. They will either figure it out or fail on their own terms. You are taxed on the money you make in the US. If you are overseas you get the overseas income exemption up to about $100k.For someone like DeNiro he would likely have an incorporation that is getting paid for his work which he can then incorporate somewhere outside of the US such as the Caymans. Then he can buy things with that corporation (corporate car, corporate house, company paid for meals, etc) while collecting a minimal income (to him) under $100k. Great presentation with some good points.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuprcn-NzIc $525 in 2 months If it doubles every year (as it has easily done in the past) for the next 12 years we are over $1 million.Can you imagine $660/BTC next year? BITCOIN SALE:Buy 2 bitcoins (at $500 each) get the third FREE!!! Looks like price discovery right now. In these conditions anything can happen. Since everyone has seen before that those at the top of these price run ups are the ones that make the money it becomes a race to be the one who sells at the top. Thus making each run up get shorter and shorter until there are none. Which is ok over time for a serious currency. For the short range I would agree, but up in the higher numbers it does tend to get lower over time when there is not much anticipation of the price going that high. From the order books it looks like a whole lot of people who haven't had their bitcoins on the exchanges before have moved them there and set their sell points all the way up to the $700 range. Doubtful that we'll get any quick run up any time soon. Woo hoo! Blockchain blockchain blockchain!!! Thanks for the info. I would have no idea what to bid. $500-$600 might be a good deal for them. JP Morgan CEO doesn't like Bitcoin?That's it. I'm out. Didn't the auction bidders need to get their bids in a few days ago? Before the price started flying upward?If so, I think a lot of people are going to get some cheap coins.Otherwise...they'll still be getting cheap coins  Nope monster.comWhen you get a job, use BitWage to direct deposit bitcoins into your account. What kind of monetary policy was used to afford such a horrible war?Were they borrowing and printing money or did they use a fixed commodity?
So where are we now?  Price has doubled in a month.This has happened in each of the previous jumps.Previously this translated into a doubling again 2 weeks later, then another doubling 1 week later...then... Namecoin and Peercoin are going up. One month double incoming. Some stoner spent the past month driving the price up just so he could see it reach 420. Queue the roller coaster gifs. Ahh, I see. A SEPA bill pay service in Europe. I'll have to check it out when I get home. This could have saved my co-worker from getting a bank account just so he can pay his electricity bill here. I'll definitely use it the next time I get a speeding camera ticket (inevitable). It is actually kinda funny how non "to the moon" this thread is these past few days compared to last time. We all want it...not sure if this is real...but waiting to see.I think at $500 we're back on track. At $800 we can start dreaming about new highs. At $2,000...pandemonium. $10k...spontaneous orgasm throughout the Bitcoin world. My work blocks it due to "Mal Ware site". Did you see the one with the guy's eyes bulging out? Any time I see that a country has banned Bitcoin, I actually go and look at what really happened and it is some entity without the authority to make anything illegal or they are merely "banning Bitcoin from their banking system".Something tells me that the chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission of Taiwan likely cannot unilaterally pass laws.These types of things also give a glimpse into how closely tied the central banks are to many governments in the world. How does one get a bitcoin account frozen?These sites are all for spending bitcoins. Bitcoin does not care if it is being sent to NYC. I have converted my currency from dollars to bitcoins.When you move to Europe are you a euro hodler with a "check out point" when the euro rises against the dollar? Do you worry about thousands of other euro hodlers checking out into the dollar?I spend bitcoins. I tend to spend more when the price jumps like this. Last week I booked a flight and hotel room. When the price gets up around $800 I'll book my spring cruise in the Caribbean (with bitcoins). Huh? Are you talking about BitWage?When I want to spend bitcoin I either spend the bitcoin or get paid a percentage when someone buys it from me for fiat. And when I use it in places like Amazon I get a 20% discount. Having bitcoins puts you in the advantaged position when spending money. I see this upward movement as an end to the bear market. There has been a lot of good news over the past year but the price constantly declining has kept investors at bay. Now that the price is not on a downward spiral we will have a lot more investors projecting future profits. Those months hanging around $230 basically put an end to the downtrend. Wow...just....wow.I was not expecting this at all.   Concerned...in the Wall Observer thread.Why I haven't seen this much concern about the blocksize since...hmm...since the last time we were over $300. Heh...looks like some people sold/shorted at this high price and are hoping some block chain panic will send it back down.I think people got tired of that being in every thread. Not so scary anymore to anyone who's spent 5 minutes looking into it.
Hey guys, haven't been around in a while. I see we're still in the $230s-$240s....boooorrrrrriiiiiiinnnnngggg! ; ) HODL!!! The swan song of Keynesians that are realize that the Bitcoin blockchain is such a great leap forward in tech but are pissed that it is not inflationary and centrally controlled like their war currencies. Hypothetical scenario:A company opens a corporation in Belize and offers shares of their corporation via colored coins to be bought and sold on the blockchain.This is all well and good because it's just like having all of the shares in a database, it just happens to be decentralized and very secure.However, since people have full control over their "colored coin/share" they can buy and sell it to whomever they want without the corporation having any knowledge of the person they sold it to.Would this fall under "bearer shares"? Would US citizens be able to buy/sell bearer shares?I am curious how the colored coin approach would work as a form of company shares. Ever used Facebook and thought...hmm, I like Facebook but I wish I could <insert X awesome idea here>. Did you ever think, if only I had the source code I would copy Facebook and add my idea and then everyone would rush to join my Facebook because it is so much more super awesome and as an added bonus, I become super rich.Bitcoin does provide the source code. The alt creators are still waiting for their alternative Facebook to take over. Not realizing that if their idea was so super awesome that Facebook started losing market share, they would just add that feature to Facebook and that's the end of your awesome clone. The rise in the dollar price is impressive considering the dollar has also risen in the past few days. I think the most important thing in Bitcoin that I have learned is that you never know what the hell the price is going to do.It is unique as a world currency, something could happen on the other side of the world that you never heard of that changes the game. I'm still just pleased that we've held over $250 for 2 weeks. I purchased my plane ticket for Christmas in bitcoins at $270 because I thought that was high. I have a cruise that I booked that I have to pay for by January...I've been holding off on paying that until a big jump. Now I'm wondering how high this thing will go. Get ready for the gut checks.  I did sell 15k euros worth last week. Thought it was a good week since I made 10% on the deal.Did not get the money back on the exchange fast enough. Kinda bummed about that one but it's all good. Got paid last Friday at $280/BTC and my average over the past year is around $250/BTC so this price range is nice. Seems that way but it wasn't a quick shot up...it's been gradual over the past week so it has potential.Even holding over $250 for so long is the death knell for the bear market. Just went to the store and bought a case of MMs. I'm gonna dump them before the scheme crashes. When do you think that will happen? Imagine the thousands of people that commit suicide when the Social Security ponzi scheme collapses. Have you ever actually seen Finland? Has anyone?The answer is no. Just like Finland doesn't exist.https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qjohv/what_did_your_parents_show_you_to_do_that_you/cn6pn30?context=3 During the "Pirate ponzi" it did swell the price toward the end. It was up around $12-$14 leading up to the last few days before it crashed down to about $9. But soon after it slowly worked back up...then up to $266. Send me $20 and I will tell you my magical method for getting people to send me $20. That was the first time I used a German ATM card in Europe. I've used my US card plenty of times through my life. I only really had a German bank account to deposit money and buy bitcoins. I never had reason before to get cash out considering so many people buy bitcoins from me for cash. Part of the difficulty being the language barrier at the time. While we were standing there a few other people used it. The reason it ate my card is likely because I didn't have the right PIN.I couldn't get any cash. I gave him 300 so he could have spending money for a few days and I went to the bank the next day to get more (where they told me I entered the wrong PIN). We actually hung out a few times and talked about Bitcoin and general ex-pat type of stuff. I helped him figure out how to pay Expedia for a hotel room with bitcoins while he looked for an apartment. Eventually his wife sent him a replacement card from home. And I got my replacement card, though I never did use it (that was the first time I tried to use my ATM card). Though after the price was hovering around $125 for a whole summer and suddenly went up to $180 my buddy asked me if he should buy. I told him the price would likely go back down to $125.As the price proceeded to rise to $1200 over the next month  He did not let me live that one down. It was more like.Me: I thought you were buying bitcoins, not buying euros. I only have 300 on me. Let me get 400 euros from this ATM we're standing at.ATM eats my card.Italian guy: Yep, same thing happened to me.
If a minority does not agree with the "consensus" then it is not consensus.If nobody is forced to do anything then those that are willing to carry things forward can do so. Linux is a simple example of this. Nobody is forced to use Gnome yet there is no consensus on using it. The minority might not like it. But they are not being forced to use it. They can come up with their own GUI or accept it if the majority puts all of the work into Gnome. Bitcoin being anonymous I don't get into it with people. I did have a guy from Italy sell me some bitcoins at 20% markup because it was the only way he could get cash quick (I had such a high markup because I don't tend to have a lot of cash handy). He was here for work and the ATM ate his card and he needed cash for an apartment (In Germany they tend to charge 3 months rent up front). I believe the ATM thing because I went to the same ATM with him and it ate my card also. There are always cycles of good and bad news. In a few weeks people will be wondering if Bitcoin is going to collapse any moment now due to <insert FUD here>. I don't ask. The one guy who told me why was because he doesn't think his government should know every little thing he does with his money.I actually paid 15% for 6k euros when I first arrived here because that was the only way I could get that many euros quickly. I needed it to buy a car. For localbitcoins I had some people driving 2 hours to trade with me because the people in their city were charging 20-25%. At the time I was only charging 15%. I've since lowered it to 10. http://cointelegraph.com/news/113477/new-eu-tax-law-could-double-tax-bitcoin-and-log-location-data This is great news. I was dreading needing to take my VAT excemption forms every time I buy bitcoins. Tiger Direct is alive and well and should go on for a while. As for the second link...not touching that one right now at work.The ones below my reviewed links are just ones posted in the thread, not day to day spending. I do use them frequently and update if they go away. d: Alt coin holders who missed getting into Bitcoin early so they think that the extra 5 minutes they put into thinking of an "improvement" on Bitcoin will change the world (and just happen to make them rich as well). HOLD! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0Spending bitcoins: A list of useful every day sites for spending bitcoins. Yep, a feature upgrade to the code is a good thing. Considering I use BTC for day to day purchases the only way we will use it for day to day purchases is if you start to as well. The auction does tend to move the price up and down due mainly to uncertainty.Fortunately though, this is the last one. That should clear the way afterwards for an upward direction. And granting more power to the government so they can use it for wars and spying on us. 21 Inc is working on decentralizing mining in a big way.When every kid's video game console is mining bitcoins any thoughts of centralization will be out the window. Ya, I'll get right on that.   Bitcoin XT was a dud. "Satoshi" posting was likely the hacker that hacked his e-mail account last year. We tend to get stuck at $266 unless we fly past it. Nevermind, was unaware of the trollness.Mentioning the 7tps repeatedly should've clued me in.
Transactions != mining.Added block size does nothing for energy cost. http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-conclusions-costs-bitcoin/ You know how little Bitcoin miners are wasting in energy right now?Do you know that 100x transactions will barely change the amount of energy used by Bitcoin miners?Have you done any research at all or is all of your information from Al Gore? No, Namecoin gives you a .bit domain name, not $1. Same here, once it passed $250 I started looking at booking my Christmas flight home on CheapAir and ordered my winter jacket/gloves on Purse. Just couldn't bring myself to spend that when the price was hovering around $230 for so long.Now that it's over $260 I'm like...gotta get home so I can book that flight before it goes back to $230. Imagine that last week the price on BitStamp was $242 and on BTC-e it was $240.Your plan: Sell 10 bitcoins on BitStamp, transfer money to BTC-e and buy bitcoins at $240.You sell your 10 bitcoins and have $2420. You withdraw your dollars to your bank (takes 3 days). You send your dollars through the crazy hoops you have to jump through for BTC-e to get your money on there losing $40 in fees.Finally today you have $2380 on BTC-e and buy bitcoins at $258/BTC.You now have 9.2 bitcoins.Profit? T0.com is actually being used for legit trades.http://www.wired.com/2015/10/hedge-fund-borrows-10m-in-stock-via-the-bitcoin-blockchain/ A Bitcoin seastead demonstrates how a Bitcoin economy can work inspiring small communities around the world to switch over to Bitcoin as their main currency using their fiat currency for things like taxes and government payments which they obtain by using localbitcoins only when needed.Several countries economies fail with their banking systems taking peoples money to pay for their debts. The first few countries suffer greatly because of this but then one country fails but has enough of a bitcoin economy that the government is the main thing to fail with several big businesses but the rest of the population moves on.After seeing that a country can fail and still continue when most of its citizens use bitcoins, other countries citizens will start switching to Bitcoin and actively vote to have their nation go bankrupt for an economic reboot. Where? That's because they're a centralized entity subject to NY laws. A decentralized computer program would not have that problem.Edit: I actually wouldn't be surprised if OpenBazaar is used by some people as an exchange. Come to think of it...maybe I need to work on an "exchange store" on there... Maybe it would be like localbitcoins or bitquick, but without the centralized website.Have not followed the decentralized exchange topics though. The run up from $10 to $266 contained a lot of jumps due to a few rich people buying large amounts of bitcoins. Friends of the twins might have some confidence in going through their exchange. This is a good video about money.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqvKjsIxT_8 Porn is what helped VCRs and the Internet take off. It could help Bitcoin. Bitcoin and gold is money. The paper that you pass around and digits in your "account" are IOUs. Does that chart mean that the Federal Reserve is loaning banks an extraordinary amount of money? Over $600 billion in September? I was most interested in their solution for this. I like that you can give specific ratings and leave a comment like on many e-commerce sites. They might want to throw in a "reply" type of thing if someone leaves a reputation comment that is untrue so the merchant can give his side. The detailed moderator rating is good too, it's good that it separates between winners and losers.They appear to be relying heavily upon 3rd party for detecting people creating a lot of accounts to build their own reputation but this was one of the most difficult aspects of it and bogging down the app with solutions is probably best for now. I liked the idea of burning some bitcoins or sending to the developers for each new account but that may have discouraged people from creating one. At least they have a solution to prevent people from spam account creation. We were sitting at $230 for a long time. It was bound to rise eventually.  Convert, hold, spend as necessary.
Drum up some publicity before it opens so people will sign up when it opens. This.I was talking to the owner of the bar I was at the other day and was explaining Bitcoin to the owner. I almost had him convinced to start accepting bitcoins for payment when he stopped and was like "wait a minute, what are the block size parameters and transactions per second?". Needless to say he was displeased that in 2 years the code would need to be changed if current transaction volume continued to increase at the current rate. He then started asking me about alt coins like Doge. He decided to start accepting Doge instead because he thought it had a funny picture with the dog and he was like "you has doges?". I believe people are speculating that the Winklevoss twins have many rich friends that were waiting for them to open a legit exchange in New York. Or they think Wall Street will start using it. Or that it is an indicator that the ETF might eventually go through.But yes, the reality is that it is yet another exchange. But the more in the US the better. qft Escrow agents can't run off with the bitcoins. The transaction will have a multi-sig transfer. The escrow agent only determines if the money goes back to the buyer or on to the seller. hodld There is no limit on the number of escrow services. They are as decentralized as the shops. The OpenBazaar platform does not have fees and you will not be required to pay any fees but for the escrow service there will be a fee and most people will likely opt for the escrow service.The developers are planning on offering an escrow service.So there will be fees, just not as much as eBay and PayPal. And there will be competition for providing that service which will drive the price down. All over Brazil people have stopped using Reals because the price is too volatile."What if I buy something and the price goes up" said one resident."I'll just wait to buy some Reals when it's not so volatile" said another.Some stores are hesitant to accept Brazilian Reals in their stores"It could also cause suspicion between residents if one resident gets a good discount for making a purchase at the right time."Others are concerned that they "...will need to regularly adjust the prices according to the market..."Goldman Sachs has released a report stating that the Brazilian Real cannot work as a currency because the Brazilian Real is just too volatile. They also noted "For businesses today it is not yet feasible to hold Brazil Real given its volatility, and so merchants must convert into other fiat currencies immediately (and incur commission charge)"Some investors have opted to just buy Brazilian Real and "hodl" in the hopes that the price skyrockets. At 7 the price = moon. Appealing to the public was the wrong approach. Work it out amongst the developers. Can't wait!!! It's not like they just released it out of nowhere, the discussion has been going on for years. Gavin even posted the question whether or not that approach was a good idea or not back in spring. A centralized Bitcoin.May as well just go back to using PayPal. What would be the difference? From the logs it looked like CodeShark_ was the one that took the discussion off of development.As far as I am concerned, it is the developers that should be discussing the block size issue. Not every n00b to read some biased article on one side or another. Imagine that coil winding up for several more months.Halving, ETF, OpenBazaar, no more auctions...plus my announcementwhat a site to behold With Onename switching to Bitcoin, will Namecoin be used at all for OpenBazaar? There is an app called i-butler in Europe, and Magic in the US.You just text them asking for whatever you want, they respond with a quote then you either pay them or not and they have it delivered. They take bitcoins.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTH14kk2IrIBut it would be cool if there was a browser plugin to analyze a site's product and find it in bitcoins on other sites. Especially if it could connect to OpenBazaar when it comes out. You would not be seeding torrents from this device, you would be receiving video streams.The benefit of paying is that someone is seeding directly to you without other people having access to that seed. So basically a direct download.For example: Someone is hosting "Free Open Movie" that a lot of people want to see, 1 or 2 people are hosting the video with 300-500 people trying to watch. Those 300-500 people are competing for bandwidth of those 1 or 2 people to stream "Free Open Movie" (publicly made available for torrenting, because nobody here advocates downloading pirated movies).With JoyStream 1 seeder decides to charge 1 cent per upload and sets the client to only allow one upload at a time. So instead of competing with 300-500 people for bandwidth you are the only one downloading that video so you will get instant streaming of the HD version of "Free Open Movie".With the super expensive 21 Inc Miner your miner may have mined 10 cents throughout the day so when you go to watch a movie, you easily have 1 cent to pay for the quality dedicated stream.Sure, the average Bitcoin user can figure out how to set up their own streaming and if JoyStream makes things better then the average Bitcoin user will easily be able to come up with 1 cent worth of Bitcoin.But the average Netflix/Amazon TV/Hulu Plus subscriber might like to just buy a single device that gives them everything with no more fees if it's as simple as using Netflix but offers more videos. I tend to have a lot on localbitcoins.But those go quick and I have to replenish them.
Valid points, people are paying about $100 for an Amazon Fire Stick pre-loaded with Kodi.I still get frustrated with trying to find a good stream on there though. It could be because I'm in Germany. The 21 Inc miner mines bitcoins and is connected to a Raspberry Pi which has an HDMI output.JoyStream is a way of paying seeders for Bittorrents.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj8di5KkoMwCombine the two and you basically have a small box you can plug into your TV and watch streaming video for free. Separate they both have their flaws. The miner does not generate much money, probably about as much as you're paying in electricity to run it.JoyStream is like running Kodi (which is free) but paying for it. But if you use Kodi you've experienced the frustration of trying to find a decent stream out of a list of about 100 streams of each TV show/movie.Combining both you have a pre-configured device that only costs you the electricity used to run it (plus the cost of the device) in order to receive quality streamed videos.You can use your cell phone as a remote. How much do you spend on things in a week? Keep that much in a hot wallet like blockchain.infoEverything else in cold storage like a paper wallet, Trezor or Case. *searches for threads about how Bitcoin price is too volatile* What do you not trust about your bitcoin transactions that you believe the government could improve? This is quite the trend of Bitcoin only companies becoming successful based on Bitcoin then offering fiat services and taking off.Not a bad business model. From what I gather and was mentioned in the video, each "hub" needs a significant amount of bitcoins in order to operate.Imagine there is a new wireless Internet service (BitCast) in town that uses the Lightning Network via the BitPay payment hub. As a user you put .5 bitcoins toward the BitPay payment service for a month time lock. You lock .5 bitcoins and BitPay locks .5 bitcoins to match. Then BitCast locks in .5 with BitPay and BitPay locks in .5 bitcoins with BitCast (I may be way off on how many people need to lock bitcoins, but for sure the hub locks bitcoins). That is 2 bitcoins that will not be on the exchanges for a month.In the meantime you're paying .0001 bitcoins per minute for your web service, paying by the minute. By the end of the month you spent 1000 minutes on BitCast's wireless connection, 1000 transactions through BitPay to BitCast. The Bitcoin blockchain receives one transaction of .1 bitcoins on the blockchain and everyone gets their locked coins back (.4 for you and .6 for BitCast). Additionally, BitPay might charge a fee for their service as a hub. So their 2 bitcoin investment might garner them .02 bitcoins for that transaction (a 12% yearly return on their bitcoin holdings).If BitCast has 10,000 customers, that's 5000 bitcoins that are not available to be traded that month.When I speak of money velocity I refer to the amount of time bitcoins are kept off of the exchange. If a remittance company can transfer $10 billion worth of bitcoins in 1 hour (fiat to bitcoin -> bitcoin back to fiat) then the bitcoin price will not be affected. If that same remittance company transferred that same amount and it took a week for the bitcoin to bitcoin transfer to go through, then that's $10 billion worth of wealth in the Bitcoin economy for that week. That would certainly push the price up.If 10 million bitcoins are being used as LN hubs, that leaves only 4 million bitcoins available for the rest of the economy.  One benefit of locking bitcoins is lower trade velocity of those coins which would result in higher bitcoin prices.If bitcoins become a commodity which you can create a hub and make more bitcoins then holding your bitcoins will become a feature that makes you money to facilitate more spending.It's like instead of buying an expensive miner, you buy expensive bitcoins. Also, people are paid to post here. Not by some Chinese government but by signature campaigns. And they do so ad nauseam. Nice, you can now use bitcoins to pay for Uber.http://cointelegraph.com/news/115291/uber-with-bitcoin-now-possible-heres-how  From the commit here:https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/commit/73c9efe74c5cc8faea9c2b2c785a2f5b68aa4c23The Bitcoin client which is supposed to be peer to peer, anonymous, decentralized, calls this line (open a connection to a centralized URL which can be manipulated):http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010379.html Title says [Bears Keep Out].  It was revealed that the Bitcoin XP thing was just a ploy to implement Mike Hearn's blacklisting code. I used to support it until I saw that. The interest hike has 2 outcomes. They don't raise the rates and it continues to weaken the dollar, which is good for Bitcoin but not any more than it has been.Or they raise the rate and it pops the stock market bubble as our debt economy gets the signal that the cheap money train is over, destabilizing not just the US economy but the world economies.The smartest thing they can do is come out of the meeting stating that they very likely plan on raising the rate .25 at the next meeting. This would be disruptive but would not trigger anything in the market and everyone can then prepare before the rate hike. We all know that "Bitcoin technology" just means they created an alt. Do you people have any discernible skills that are worth more than $1 an hour? Or are you from extremely poor countries?I used to sell my plasma for $25 back in college twice a week when times got tough. Then I got a job washing dishes.Can you wash dishes? This would make it easy for merchants like BitPay and others to have instant transactions for every one of their merchants.Lightning network also lets you make money from just hosting a hub. This could be a way to invest your bitcoins and get bitcoins in return. Like mining without the electricity costs.I was also thinking that this could be a solution for renting a car. You submit your deposit, it's locked until just after your rental return. When you return your car without a scratch the rental owner cancels the transaction, your deposit never gets sent. If you bring it back with damage the owner completes the transaction and gets your deposit (then you work out any further payments or he refunds money if the damage is less than the deposit).The main thing this addresses is per minute type of services like Internet and media. You can go get a job in a grocery store or fast food place. Get paid $5 an hour or so. Then buy bitcoins.Or set up a localbitcoins account. Depending where you live you can make 2%-10% per trade. If you sell $500 worth of bitcoins at just 2% you will make $10. Or go on Amazon Mechanical Turk and make a small amount of money. Convert it to bitcoins.Buy something on Amazon via Purse.io at 20% off, turn around and sell it on ebay at full price and you've made 20% of the amount you spent.Don't join a signature campaign and add to the crap posts on here. He tried to sell the business, even had offers for $250k+ but felt it was worth more. Apparently waiting for that $10 million VC investment to make him rich.On that note, does OpenBazaar have an auction feature or is it all just stores with fixed prices?Considering Openbazaar has not been released yet this makes no sense. At least wait until it's been released before you talk about how useless it is.
"Bitcoins, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity, the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them, and the value of the capital employed in the miners which produce them." -David Bitcardo legit According to the US government Bitcoin is treated like property. Bitcoin does not have legal tender status.Some people would consider property as an investment. Nah, he just wasn't ready to run a business.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=41592.msg3660380#msg3660380 You don't have enough bitcoins to spend?Do you ever spend any money? What's the difference? Escrow. RTFMI provided a link to a video (you don't even have to read) that explains that calculator. The Bitcoin ebay site, BitMit, did pretty well with many merchants and quite a few users. And that was just a website run by one guy (who apparently was overwhelmed and shut it down). Zero out all variables except for number of bitcoins mined and it shows $0.00Instead of the other way around? The video has the equation as: P = (TxVol/Vel) * (1/Supply)P = PriceTxVol = Transaction VolumeVel = VelocitySupply = Current amount of bitcoins that exist Here is a Bitcoin velocity calculator to play with:http://worldbitcoinnetwork.com/BitcoinPriceModel-Alpha.htmlWith a video to explain it a bit more:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2nXgK34HIM&feature=shareImagine BitWage had everyone getting paid in bitcoins at the beginning of the month. And everyone spent their bitcoins with BitPay merchants. BitWage is fiat -> bitcoins. BitPay is bitcoins -> fiat.If everyone held their bitcoins all month and waited until just before they got paid again and spent their whole paycheck at a BitPay merchant then the only bitcoins available on the exchange would be those bitcoins mined that month.If everyone got paid in bitcoins then immediately turned around and spent their whole paycheck at a BitPay merchant then there would be plenty of bitcoins available all month on the exchanges.The reality is that people are paid at different times and spend at different times so as more people are paid in bitcoins with BitWage it will eventually cancel out the spending via BitPay.More merchants accepting bitcoins via BitPay or any other means encourages people to get paid in bitcoin via BitWage and vice versa. The key is velocity of each coin. If 14 million bitcoins are sitting in peoples' wallets not being used, then those last few bitcoins for trade will be highly sought after. If all bitcoins are in play on a daily basis then they will be easier to obtain and thus a lower price. BitWage is the opposite of that, and continues to grow. $1 million in transactions last month. I have repeated assurances by all bears that all miners immediately sell all of their bitcoins for fiat. Even just keeping current demand will ensure a rise in price when there is a smaller supply.  I have also invested in a business that I believe in. About $10k worth of bitcoins that could or could not have returned me more as a bitcoin investment but will be worth so much more if the business takes off.So much more for the Bitcoin community too  The threat is that central control of a currency relies on the force of the government to maintain a horrific currency that encourages a police state and more, bigger, wars. This. The consumerism economy that cheap money has created is ridiculous. Let's waste as much of our planet's resources as we can so that we can turn them into something we use for 5 minutes then throw away.Investing so that your money is working for you? This creates a large part of society that is just living off of money working for them. That is not productivity, that is a drain on society.As someone who actually lives on Bitcoin and from what I have heard of others who are doing the same, we spend our money on things that matter and don't waste as much money on frivolous things. Personally I have found it very freeing to not care about "stuff" anymore. Everything I own can fit inside a backpack and suitcase (other than my very economical car). I see posts on Facebook of some "cool" product followed by tons of posts of "I want!". While I look at it, think it's kinda clever and have no care for acquiring it. I spend most of my money on living life. I travel to a new country at least once a month. Collecting experiences as opposed to things. Enjoying people instead of possessions. I feel bad for my co-workers who all have 6 figure incomes who are always complaining about not having enough money, and credit card bills and all of this debt. While they drive high priced cars (with insane gas bills), constantly have packages being delivered with new goodies and expensive places to live.  Jorge and other Keynesians hate people saving their money because then nobody has a safety net. Without a safety net this necessitates the government to provide it. And there is nothing Keynesians love more than government force. The government should control the currency, the government should make all of the decisions. For professors that live in their little socialist bubble where they are the top dogs in the socialist sphere they see it as quite the reasonable system. Forgetting that outside of their little bubble there is the world of the free market that keeps their little bubble going.As you have all of this knowledge of Bitcoin but, like every banker and other professor like the "blockchain" but not Bitcoin (mainly because it is more like gold than the dollar) then I suggest you go create your own Federal Reserve Coin. Being the creator you can live under even more eliteness because you will be in control of it. Change the currency all the time so it matches up with the dollar, add inflation so that people don't hoard it (even though Bitcoin currently has a 12% inflation rate and yet people still hold long term). Create your masterpiece and go to the bankers for their support. Get rid of anonymity, have the government issue trackers for anyone buying so that everyone's money can be tracked and people can be properly spied on to make sure they're buying the "right" things (approved by the government). Maybe the banks will even run the mining for you so that no miners get profit. What a grand utopia of Keynesianism and centralized control.
By the time all of the 21 million are distributed it will be a world currency. The price will not rise from new users, it will hold its value.Keynes need not be involved in the new world currency. He has done enough damage already. It should only list the advantage to the business. Those are all advantages of Bitcoin but a business just wants a simple "how does this benefit my bottom line?".I think a payment processor should be listed because most businesses don't care about the politics like we do. They don't care about XP or Core or BIP100 or whichever. They want simple, 5 minutes and I'm accepting this thing that brings me more customers. I've only set up a business with BitPay so that's what I went with, I know it's easy.The "add your bank account" part lets them know that they'll be getting paid in their local currency. Could probably specify that.Could also say at the bottom:For other Bitcoin payment options try "XYZ, abc, etc." Yep. Is there any way to just send that dust to the miners by making the full transaction the fee? Would that cancel out the size of the transaction?Or send to a sink hole address? I have used Birthday cards online and printed the public and private key on the card.Then you just print it and fold it. What do you think about business cards that you can leave at businesses requesting that they accept Bitcoin as a payment?Something like:"Please pass this card along to the owner""Greetings, although today I paid using your conventional payment system I would rather pay using Bitcoin. For me it is more convenient and for you it is cheaper than paying credit card fees. I would also be more likely to visit more often if Bitcoin was a payment option. As would other Bitcoin users."back of card"Here are the simple steps for accepting Bitcoin:1. Sign up for BitPay (or CoinBase, Paymium) at http://www.bitpay.com2. Set up your business and bank account for deposit3. Download the app to a tablet or phone made available at your business for payment."Can anyone come up with a design? There are plenty of businesses that could print out cards. Yes, you would need to ensure that someone does not hack the machine to give out their own Bitcoin address instead of that of the business. But such a machine could easily be locked down by a secure password with plenty of crypto access restrictions. Maybe even a dongle that only the owner controls to make any changes. I recommend a way to review a venue.I visited Copenhagen this weekend and 4 of the 5 Bitcoin businesses I visited accepted Bitcoin but did not have their machines working to accept it.In some cases understandable, I would not want to say that they no longer accept Bitcoin and take them off the list but if they get enough reviews of "waitress said the machine is down", then people won't waste their time.In some cases I think the waiter/waitress just didn't know how to do it so they opted for the "it's down right now" response. Ruble exchange hacked?Is this the end of the Ruble? Do you have to call to activate this card? I tried to use it at a restaurant and it did not go through. hold Most businesses don't really know much about Bitcoin and don't want to spend the time integrating something they don't believe is worth the time. But what if it was no effort and they don't even have to lift a finger to accept it?When you start your business you usually order a Point of Sale (PoS) system. Usually companies will give out the equipment for free then have a 1 or 2 year contract where they have to pay a monthly fee to pay it off.When I started a business I chose a cheaper option, I signed up for an online service that was very cheap and I bought a USB card swiper that I could connect to my computer. This cut the price down a lot, it just required that I have Internet at the business which most places do.If we could design a PoS machine that runs off of wifi, when they sign up we could sign them up for both the credit card service and a Bitcoin service. The machine could have a small screen that is usually used for credit card transactions but might have a little BTC button on the front that you can press to get a QR code. We design it and get it out as a cheaper alternative to all of the other options but with the same functionality. No need to even bring up the Bitcoin capabilities. It could just register that business on coinmap.org when they sign up. I don't usually recommend Bitcoin to anyone. I told my family that they should buy some bitcoins back when the price was $17 because I care about their futures and felt that I should share it with them so that we could all prosper together. My brother responded with an article about someone that wanted to make it illegal, my sister said she didn't have enough money to invest in anything and everyone else ignored it. I did my due diligence. I bought each of my nieces and nephews 1 bitcoin for their birthdays when the price was below $100. The true gift will be when they figure out how to spend it.I don't recommend bitcoins to people. I just tell them how it benefits me. I lead by example. My co-workers at work know that I get paid 10% to get my money converted to euros while they are paying a 5% conversion fee for their euros. I have no clue why they continue to waste their money. I think they just figure it's too late for them to get into Bitcoin, or they ask me if I can show them how to make some quick money with bitcoins.I figure that recommending bitcoins to the very people who are the cause of so many of the problems we have right now is not worth it. They deserve what they get. BitWage  I'm heading to Copenhagen this weekend. Flight paid with bitcoins, hotel paid with bitcoins.I saw on coinmap that there are several places where I will be able to use bitcoins including a Bitcoin ATM where I can get some local currency. That looks really nice. Yep, bitcointalk has become blocksizetalk. Perhaps this is a good business model.Start with something innovative and accept bitcoins and credit cards.The early adopter types such as Bitcoin users are willing to try it out and get it off the ground. Then as your business grows the larger market of credit card users will get wind of it and start using your service as well. Hey guys how about that price...oops, sorry...didn't mean to interrupt your block size debatecarry on When you pay with a credit card you are not paying with dollars. That is not a defeat to the dollar. I paid for my Skype subscription with bitcoins. I got the gift code on egifter.com

But could be better.Right now you buy a card in $5 increments on Gyft instantly, in $1 increments on Egifter after some time. So it is not ideal for just going to a store and getting your total then buying in bitcoins only the amount you want to use.But what if you had an app where you pre-load some spending money in bitcoins. Then when you get the bill you just type in the amount of the bill and you are given a gift card code with the exact amount of the purchase and that amount is deducted from your bitcoin amount.A third party company could easily do this by buying enough of each card available on each of these sites and as they are used, just automatically buy more. Considering most of these places offer discounts of 3% to 5% for their cards you could take 1-2% for each transaction as a profit.Or the companies themselves could do this on their own to avoid the middleman. How would your nonprofit preserve ocean life? Will you be giving people ownership of sections of the ocean to have control over and maintain with the incentive to keep their own property clean?Or are you creating a sinkhole of money to "raise awareness" about ocean pollution? So strange. I get ripped off and the bank blames me. Either way, I think I'll go with ING. Since the only thing I use a bank for here is to deposit cash and move it to an exchange any bank will do.I tried the BitQuick thing for selling bitcoins via SEPA a few times but will not go that route again. Yes, I live in Germany. The only thing I use banks for is to deposit cash and send it to a Bitcoin exchange. I had a Deutsche Bank account but they dropped me after someone reversed a SEPA transfer to me (after I sent them bitcoins). I guess they felt it would be easier to drop me than deal with it. I am considering getting a Fidor bank account because they are Bitcoin friendly. But I see that they only have one ATM based in Munich.How do I get my cash euros into my Fidor bank account?Would I need a bank account at another bank to deal with Fidor? Because you are an inexperienced day trader you believe crypto is a dud?Perhaps you can go start day trading the stock market and find out how wonderful the stock market is. And trading on the Forex market.There is a saying in poker. There is always one fish at the table that the experienced players will reel in and bleed dry when they come to their table. If you get to a table and don't know who the fish is...you're the fish.Are you the one manipulating the other people putting their money into Bitcoin? If not, then you're the one being manipulated. I work for the military (contractor). I'm not in the military.It would be like working for communist government elites who need shit to actually work because they can't get stuff working within their system, you get the money and can get the benefits of their system (cheaper/free food/gas) but being able to live in the private sector enjoying the free market.Still have to work with the incompetence of the communist system though.  Bitcoin's utility is using it to buy stuff online. And it is close to being to the point where you can drop your bank.It is merely a currency, you switch to whatever currency is best for the situation. I live in Germany but work for the military so I have access to the military base. Everything on the military base requires dollars, everything else requires euros. I am used to going back and forth between currencies. I don't "buy dollars" and watch the value fluctuate. I convert some euros to dollars and get enough for things I might need for that week. I convert bitcoins to euros with enough currency to pay for things in the near future. My reserve currency is bitcoins because it is easier to store and travel with bitcoins than with cash and that is what I am paid in. I don't worry too much about the value fluctuation other than spending more when the price goes up a lot and holding off when the price drops.  Ich kann sie zu kaufen. Was Wechselkurs? A few weeks ago they said something about now getting tracking numbers.Amazon has something called "Mechanical Turk" where people will pay you very small amounts of money to do menial tasks. I tried it for a while, going to various websites and clicking on something or creating an account and such, which garnered me after a few days of doing it (off and on) about $2.The thing is, poor people in third world countries are willing to sit at their computer and do these menial tasks to get that $2. After accumulating enough money they then want to get their local currency. The thing is, Amazon does not have an efficient way to pay these people in third world countries, they are paid in Amazon points. To get their own currency it would take them like 6 months to get their money. Or they can go through Purse.io and use their Amazon points to buy things and get paid in bitcoins, which they can likely more easily convert to their own currency. They are also silent on anti-depressant control. What's going on? Something about a block size?Does anyone have an opinion on that? Because it didn't look like it does in movies it must be fake.Right? My gun knowledge is very sparse so I will defer to you on that one. Same concept though, it took almost 20 shots to kill 2 people so obviously not high caliber. So, all of these people were in on it and now 3 people have to change their identities and move far away to perpetuate the hoax.Or...one guy shot 3 people, one of which survived, then shot himself.As for the lack of movie/TV/video game blood splatter, it appears that he used a small caliber weapon. The longer video records 14 shots after that short video. Even when he tried to shoot himself in the head he survived long enough to be taken to the hospital. Obviously something like a 9mm that does not leave a huge exit wound and likely does not even go all the way through the body. Nice try Hillary. The name Bit or Coin or Bitcoin in the name makes me feel better that it's not some alt scam site.
Bitcurex.Oddly enough my euros were converted to PLN. At a poor exchange rate. My wire transfer I started on Friday finally gets to the exchange today???F*%king banks. Third world countries have a culture of having more children due to mortality rates and a culture where the parents are taken care of by the children in old age.It was true in the US in the past as well. We have less children now because we can. I tend to check these charts to see which is the popular choice for each currency.http://bitcoinity.org/markets/localbitcoins/GBPLooks like Coinfloor is the top one for pounds. Having followed gold price for over a decade, the gold price tends to go down when the stock market crashes. Even though it is a hedge long term.Low prices on the stock market are great opportunities for those hedging the market to take from their hedge and buy cheap stocks. Mowing my lawn only costs me $75 per month. The $600 was a one time yard overhaul including cutting down dozens of trees.My house is north of Tampa. You can buy most things online at Amazon or Ebay with bitcoins.As for an apartment...try 9flats.com Any block size discussion that discusses motives instead of actual technical discussion is pure propaganda on both sides. Almost had a full page without talk of block size.  Transferred several thousand to the exchange Friday...still waiting for it to go through. Is it on the Internet? Then the NSA is watching it.Or you can just go to meetups and talk in person. Though if there is one guy there that has a really short haircut and is pretty physically fit for a computer geek and seems very interested in getting peoples' personal information...then they're watching that meeting too. Hey guys the bitcoin price...oops, didn't mean to interrupt your XT discussioncarry on Exactly, the Amazon store that sells Gamestop cards would have to be a scammer. At which point, they get dropped as an Amazon store and you can have the person that purchased it, reverse his payment.Shell would have to scam all Gamestop stores if they were to be reversing cards sold at Gamestop stores.The only way it could reach the initial person getting the bitcoins is if you get the code e-mailed to you by the purchaser. Then they can just go to a Gamestop with that code before you and use it. Most people on Purse have things shipped so that you have a paper trail of a tracking code. And people also have reputation on Purse.The only thing that would stop this from working is if Gamestop puts out a warning to all employees to not sell gift cards for Gamestop cards. Which is likely if it becomes widespread and popular.But, Amazon also sells Southwest Airlines cards. So you can get 25% off on Southwest Airlines flights using Bitcoin as well. One of Bitcoin's intrinsic values gets another boost. Try to do that with PayPal. Yes, I finally realized that. I still think Szabo is likely Satoshi. I am even more convinced now that Szabo is Satoshi.And I find it interesting that he sort of called Gavin Judas. Ideally a 2MB bump by 2016 with some serious vetting viability of the lightning network. Sign up, verify your account with KYC documents, bank account...I am considering going on Facebook and telling everyone I'll give them $50 if they go sign up and buy $100 worth of bitcoins on Coinbase. Free money. Yes, but the block size code was only recently added. Yep, so I'm not the only one who sees that as a poor move. So instead of saying we should not centralize a decentralized currency, I should be coding a solution to some DoS attacks.
I think a lot of people are changing their minds on XT after the addition of blacklisting code.Why didn't they just keep the Core code except add the block size upgrade? Blacklisting IPs (or giving them lower priority as is in the new XT code) can be used just the same as how the great Firewall of China works. And could easily be used to give lower priority to certain countries by IP range. Sure you can jump behind a VPN, travel to another country etc. but why allow it in the first place.I was ok with the XT block size upgrade. It made sense. But seeing that 90% of the code differences have to do with this blacklist code and not the block size (and the fact that Mike Hearn has advocated for blacklists) tells me that this is likely not about block size after all.I really don't like the idea of having a central web server used in what is supposed to be a decentralized system. The question was "how could this be achieved?".The answer is. Add a centralized URL to the code. Act like it's being used to prevent DDOS. hodlin I did not say blocking. I said treating them differently.A central server used to treat some IPs differently than others.Does not sound very decentralized. http://www.bitcurex.com caters to people from Greece. But it will likely require a SEPA transfer. A proven myth:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw6-PhvcS3M The exchanges that provide it are making a whole lot of money off of the amateur margin traders. Someone could add a URL to a website in the Bitcoin client to check for IPs that should be treated differently.Like...oh say....torproject.org Source? If you have a Gamestop that sells Shell gift cards it works.And can get Gamestop cards from Amazon.com Every thread on this site is now the same. The thread titles do not matter.Obligatory: XT, blocksize Pretty interesting, I did not know about this:http://cointelegraph.com/news/115149/how-to-save-25-on-gasoline-when-paying-with-bitcoinFrom my experience I have gotten up to 35% off of my Amazon purchases on purse.io. But they say 22% is the average. Ya, I don't think anyone every suggested getting paid in the same bitcoin value each check. We're not there yet. It will come back eventually. I think there was downward pressure because we prematurely jumped from the $240s due to Greece news. It helped to highlight the uses of Bitcoin but people expected it to cause a big rally. But at least we were on a long term upward move so no worries. Well it's not 10% of my salary...I cycle money through the bank and back to bitcoin constantly through the month.So much that Deutsche bank dropped me   thanks How does one get into this whaleclub? They said it was a soft fork...adding a time feature to the current code.Bitcoin is already complex. When Bitcoin first came out we did not have phone apps to scan someone's QR code to send bitcoins. Similar easy to use services will do the same thing for the lightning network. Had some money set aside for rent at the end of the month and car repair but I'm getting that to the bank quickly after work. I will likely miss these cheap coins by Monday when it reaches the exchange.
If you're getting paid in Bitcoin...then you can be one of those localbitcoin people charging a lot.Where I am the localbitcoin price is high as well. I get paid in bitcoins but convert it to euros and charge 10%. Most months I can pay for rent and food just from the extra 10%. Imagine BitPay and BitStamp having their own lightning connection open for 1 week. Imagine every purchase through BitPay gets sent to BitStamp via the Bitcoin lightning connection for that week. Each purchase gets converted to dollars and is added to BitPay's dollar account. Over the course of that week tens of thousands of transactions go through for a total of 100,000 bitcoins.When the time expires on that connection the connection is closed and a single blockchain entry is added to the Bitcoin blockchain that BitPay has sent 100,000 bitcoins to BitStamp. One transaction as opposed to tens of thousands.Same with microtransactions. You open up a wifi connection and pay per minute. You use the lightning connection and transfer .0001 bitcoins per minute that you are connected. You close your connection and the finally tally of .01 bitcoins is recorded on the blockchain for 100 minutes instead of 100 transactions recorded on the blockchain. I get paid in bitcoins. The dump sucks, especially since I was just paid on Friday. But I get paid again next Friday. I have a few big things I need to pay for but I'll wait until next Friday.I usually have several things I save up to spend on until the price jumps. I put a down payment for a cruise when the price was $290. Booked a flight to Denmark around $280.Now I just need to book a hotel room for Denmark but I can wait until I get paid (or the price goes above $270). Ahh, they only serve the US right now.I have been converting 100% of my paycheck to bitcoins since January. They convert my direct deposit directly to a bitcoin address I provided them. I just give my employer a direct deposit number they provide. I have noticed that the exchange rate they provide is about 1% above current exchange prices. But that's how much Coinbase charges so no big deal for the advantage of avoiding my bank account. Link is in the OP.It does centralize because the nodes require a lot of bitcoins to run peoples' transactions. But if you have the option of lightning or the blockchain then you'd probably have specialized reasons for using lightning nodes. Such as microtransactions or some place that you do a lot of transactions with in a short amount of time. I have a Bitcurex account. I don't see anything about debit cards on their site. Price is moving too fast to take advantage of gaps on the exchanges. I remember that happening on Gox. I had a really low price set up to buy and the charts showed the price dropping below that price and coming back up. But my order wasn't filled.Obviously some bug occurred. Couldn't you use BitWage? If I was in the US I could live off of so much more than I do in Europe.The fact that you can buy groceries at Whole Foods, Target, CVS, Kmart, etc. And you can use Bitcoin to pay for your food at Applebees, Chilis, Dominos, Burger King, Charleston's, Cracker Barrel, Cold Stone Creamery, IHOP, Logan's Roadhouse, Morton's, Papa Johns, Red Robin, Saltgrass, Steak n Shake, Texas Roadhouse, TGI Fridays, Tony Roma's would allow me to go quite a while without needing dollars.And since you can buy just about everything else online at Amazon and e-bay. There is very little you can't buy online. Movie tickets at AMC theaters, Fandango.Home Depot, Lowes, TJ Maxx, Cabela's, Sports Authority, Toys R Us, Best Buy, Dell...etc.There is little excuse in the US to not get paid in bitcoins. Or at least part of your paycheck if your employer allows for direct deposit to different accounts. A lot of people want other people to get paid in bitcoins.But won't go ahead and switch over themselves. You have the option. What are you waiting for?*insert "I can't buy groceries with bitcoins in my area" here* Reading through the code I don't like that Bitcoin code includes a URL to get the TOR IPs so that those IPs can be given lower priority/blocked.So...in the future, just manipulate that central point to block whoever you want out of Bitcoin. Yes, this sounds like so many other announcements like "32,000 merchants in Europe will be able to accept bitcoins" only to find out that each merchant has to add some software to their payment system and set up their payment information with the company. What Bitcoin ATM company even has the manufacturing capability for 1000 ATMs?As for it being too late? Greece is definitely not out of the woods, they will crash again. Nothing really changed except they got some more money to waste. I watched the presentation on the lightning network and if it allows regular payments along with the option for this side enhancement then it could help a lot with the block size problem.The lightning network basically allows people to set up payment nodes to run transactions which can be as many transactions as you want in a certain amount of time without touching the blockchain. At the end of the time period the final balance of the transaction is posted to the blockchain. The people running the nodes have no way to interfere with the transactions and it allows for more anonymity.I am cautiously optimistic about it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aI4inWxBwk If you work in the US you can get paid in Bitcoin if your pay is direct deposited.Use http://www.bitwage.co More and more people are getting paid in Bitcoin weekly. Flight and hotel are simple. And Bitcoin makes it easy to find a localbitcoins person in the country you're visiting so you can get the local currency. For now there are only usually one or 2 restaurants in most cities I've been to that accept Bitcoin so I hit those and pay local currency for the rest. Transportation from the airport requires currency. Last time I was in Poland I arrived at the airport, bought a phone card with euros. Received change in Zlotis, enough to pay for a bus ticket to the hotel where someone from localbitcoins met me in the lobby. Gave me a price very close to the exchange rate surprisingly.There's this guy who's traveling around the world on Bitcoin (similar as me where he tries to pay for everything with bitcoins but if he can't he uses local currency purchased through localbitcoins).http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/08/18/a-yearlong-trip-around-the-world-using-only-bitcoin/ I woke up like many mornings seeing a huge price drop only to realize I had it set to euros. I saw the price and was like...oops, must be euros again. Not so much. "I threw it out there as an extreme view of what someone could do. Unfortunately a lot of people in the community thought that I was proposing we get rid of the 21 million bitcoin cap." -Jon Matonishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=748&v=OwO5u6OVaaA Ever since the price held over $240 for more than a week I've been happy that we're out of the bear market. I did not expect the price to rise so quickly so early, my prediction is a price rise to begin in spring of 2016.Though I do believe the price should be sitting just over $400 right now.I was a bit hesitant when I had several people buying bitcoins from me at $280 on localbitcoins. But I don't turn away customers so I figured I'd just bite the bullet. That money finally got to the exchange today so I'm glad the price is down. I've used the ANX card which works at US card places. It's pre-paid and charges 5%. Too much for my tastes.I have a Bit-x card, you choose between EUR and USD. I chose EUR since I'm in Europe. Tried it on the military base which is US based and it was declined (expected).I will try the card some time this week, I usually just pay for cash for everything so this will be different.I think I ordered a Xapo card like 2 times, I've never received it. Bit-x dropped their monthly inactivity fee as far as I could tell.
Including the Wall Observer thread. Which is always on topic. The block size discussion has been going on for over half a year. Alt coiners keep poking Bitcoin users with the whole thing acting like the upgrade will somehow hurt Bitcoin. Now they're just pointing to discussion of it as a reason why Bitcoin is doomed.Don't feed the trolls/alt coiners. Are the miners selling all of their LTC to pay for electricity? I thought POS was supposed to solve that. If they aren't then the inflation rate does not affect it as much as with Bitcoin's PoW. Sure if it has a limited amount and wasn't pre-mined to death. Were any of the ripples pre-mined?I prefer using a currency that will gain value over time. When he finishes I would like to work with him on some sort of Bitcoin city contest. Rewarding the best city to travel to for tourists living on Bitcoin.Maybe reward the winning city with tons of advertising and publicity. Will I be able to spend my bitcoin daily before and after the devs and miners work this out?Yes.QED You know the amount of people who are hearing about Bitcoin for the first time and want to start buying bitcoins care about the block size upgrade debate?Zero.Remember all of the debates about BIP 75 implementation? Oh you weren't part of that debate yet you find the need to be involved in a debate about this upgrade? Why is this upgrade something you care about and not the multi-sig upgrade? FUD? Listening to the alt coiners trying to make it look like there's some "great divide" in Bitcoin?The developers argue about code changes all the time. Let it go already. With the Open Assets protocol I was always a bit hesitant because in the protocol you point the assets to a website address to point to any meta data.While meta data does not interfere with ownership or transactions, it is useful information for each asset.What if the Open Asset clients started incorporating Namecoin? You could use a .bit address so there is no central point of failure where someone could hack the domain server and change the meta data.Sure, the host could be hacked but you could just point the .bit address to a backup IP address.Any thoughts on how easy this would be to combine or if it is a good solution? Quite cool. I have hit most of western Europe and always try to hit at least one Bitcoin place in each new city I go to. Yet another fork thread.Some people love drama. Some people are very bad at math.The price has stayed over $220 for most of 2015. That is with 3600 bitcoins being sold per day due to mining.If that price can be maintained with 3600 bitcoins being sold each day, imagine which direction the price will go when only 1800 bitcoins are being sold each day due to mining*.That will happen in less than a year.*hey, if the bears can keep claiming that all the mined bitcoins are immediately sold, I can use their argument to prove that the price will go up Some every day uses I get out of bitcoins listed and reviewed here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0 There is a huge difference.BitcoinXT fork is 75% of the Bitcoin community agreeing to allow for phased in block size increases.Altcoins are copies of Bitcoin changed significantly and started from scratch so that n00bs can think that they are early adopters and they're going to get rich some day.And the blocksize code is just a code enhancement to the existing Bitcoin protocol. If forking actually caused an alt coin then Bitcoin is already an alt of the pre-2013 fork version of Bitcoin.Bitcoin code is upgraded all the time. Yep, lasted about half a day then rose quickly after that.And that was an unexpected fork. Imagine how easy the transition will be when we can pretty much watch it happen down to the hour. I didn't know Tor was illegal. I meet up with members of the Bitcoin project and there has been some illegal activity using bitcoins.Hawaii probably has a small nerd community and there are a lot of military folks there in the shitty part of Hawaii (from what I heard) where he worked. So I'm sure the social circles are pretty small. Hadn't heard about anything about that but defense contractors do all sorts of things outside of work that everyone else does. As long as you're not giving out classified information or doing drugs/breaking laws you can live your life.  Just listen to Ron Paul, he's been telling everyone his whole career what's going on. Snowden ruined his life for nothing.  Easily predictable and accountable money supply. 50/25/12.5 etc. is a lot easier than .000135323 less reward next block. As someone who works in the same field as Snowden used to, I am very confident that he is wrong.Since he has been open to revealing classified information, there is no need for him to be guarded about revealing any Bitcoin flaws. Bitcoin already forked once.Remember what happened to the price?
Yep, they're like cockroaches...pushing their shitcoins so that they can be super rich early adopters since they missed getting into Bitcoin early.They change a few lines of code and suddenly believe their shitcoin is far superior to Bitcoin and should be the main cryptocurrency. Unfortunately for them, network effect is much more important than any coding tweak when it comes to currency.I sat through a whole cryptocurrency conference that turned into a shitcoin conference with everyone getting on stage bashing Bitcoin and talking about why their coin was superior. Had I known it was a shitcoin conference I would not have wasted my time. So do the EUR cards only work at European merchants?I was sort of hesitant when choosing between EUR and USD. I live in Europe but usually have plenty of euros but I occasionally go on the US military base and use my card to buy things there. I stopped at Taco Bell and tried to use my bit-x card (I chose the EUR option) and it was rejected. For both debit and credit. Volatility should not be that big of a deal when spending bitcoins.If you spend bitcoins and the price goes up, how is that any different than spending dollars and the price of bitcoins goes up?You could have just as easily converted those dollars to bitcoins before the price went up instead of spending them.  Getting paid in Bitcoin, I do enough trade in localbitcoins that I have cash reserves as needed and anything extra I send back to the exchange.There are only a few things I need by bank for and I'm working on finding a fix for that.We are much further than a few years ago and I am sure in a couple more years it will be even easier.As far as using credit cards not being the same as living off of bitcoins...is your VISA card a dollar VISA card? No. It is merely a payment processor. The credit card company pays your bill in the currency that the business accepts then takes from your account the currency that you use. It could be euros, dinars, dollars, etc. So using your bitcoins as the funding currency is just another option. Most of our daily transactions use payment processors unless you're using cash. h o l d scamcoinsorry for your loss btc-e costs $15 to deposit your money onto the exchange. Still playing with $266. Probably meant 7/8, been in Europe too long. Though I verified the date and it was 7/12. I will eventually have to pursue legal action if nothing is done soon. Several news sources:http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/02/17/exclusive-interview-billpayforcoins/http://cointelegraph.com/news/113942/how-to-get-your-mom-to-use-bitcoinhttps://vimeo.com/118973760I've seen a few trusted people on the forums say that they used the service and it worked. They were actually doing what they claimed to do for quite a while. Their business is registered, they'd been around for a while and I even had some discussions with Mark.If I don't get money I will pursue legal action to get it back.At the very least, Mark Vick and Grant Brown are finished with creating any future Bitcoin businesses. I converted 800 bitcoins into cash one time back in the day through BitPay.That was before the Stazi stuff though. Good question. I will look into this approach. They didn't bother to tell me at all.They responded to a reddit thread 2 weeks ago and have since gone silent again.http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3eshfl/warning_billpayforcoinscom_is_a_defunct_business/    Bill Pay For Coin, LLC    604 N Scott Avenue    Belton, MO  64012    +1 (913) 608-9702Mark Vick & Grant Brown You can easily double small amounts or gain small amounts of money using large amounts. If you are willing to take risks.But it is not as simple with larger values. Imagine someone steals trillion of dollars per year from people and they use it to go out and bomb and shoot people and kidnap and imprison millions of other people.Scary thought. I have pretty much reached the point where I can live off of bitcoins without using any credit/debit cards. My plan was to reach the point where I can drop my bank. The only thing I use my bank account for at this point is paying my mortgage and my lawn service for the house I have in the US. Last month I decided to pay a big bill for my lawn service of $750 through BillPayForCoins.com. They ended up taking my bitcoins and not paying my bills (which I just found out last week from my lawn guy). I'm glad I didn't try paying my mortgage last month.DO NOT USE BillPayForCoins.com!Their claim is that while one partner was out of town on family issues the bank shut down their account. That's all well and good but they still took my bitcoins and haven't responded to any e-mails or phone calls to get my money back.This is a major blow toward the idea of having a Bitcoin Bill Pay service in the US. They can do it in Canada and Australia, it appears that the banks in the US are in "then they fight you" phase against Bitcoin.So what should the solution be? The way I see it, the answer usually comes from technology and decentralization.I think the way it could be done would be somehow using OpenBazaar to do something like BitQuick where individuals can sign up to use their bank accounts to pay bills and get a percentage of profit. You would have a list of people willing to pay your bills with Bitcoins. You send it through an escrow and the bitcoins could be released upon verification that the payment went through (or a set amount of days). As a bonus, if someone could write a plugin to automatically set up the Bill Payment then it would essentially be a free money generator for anyone running it. Decentralized, people can turn their cash into bitcoins and no way for the banks to shut it down.  No, and it looks like any other company would probably run into the same problem that BillPayForCoins did with their banks shutting them down.Which usually means that the next step would be decentralization and technology. I'm sure this won't last long enough for me to get my euros to the exchanges.Between my bank dropping me because I'm dealing in bitcoin and my exchange dropping me because I'm American it isn't the easiest thing to get bitcoins these days.But when I do get my money to one of the exchanges, hopefully the price is in this range. I won't hold my breath though.
the sky is falling So I guess we passed the $266 number too quickly.Retards will want to stay at that price for a while to make some sort of point like we did on the way down.We will see the same thing at $666. Wow, JorgeStolfi actually has some sound advice finally.It's not that your passphrase isn't awesome, but most websites and logins that have a password cannot be hacked because it is difficult to determine that password due to restrictions on repetitive guesses. When I graduated college in 1997 I wrote a quick program to guess passwords by a simple changing of letters in a large string of characters just to see how easy it was to figure out my own password. A quick program at the processing power of the time took less than 30 minutes for a seemingly strong password. Back in that day you could continually try passwords no problem, the server would not kick you out. As I am not a hacker, that's about the furthest I went into the hacking world.With brain wallets there is no server side prevention for guessing as many times as you want to guess your pass phrase. If it is not more complicated than a private key, it will be guessed. Then he just says he didn't offer him anything since it's intangible.  Tried to install the windows version today. No success after about an hour.Installed GitHub for Windows, then Python, then py2exe, then (oops) had to install the py2exe for Python 3, then learn how powershell works for running ps1 files in unrestricted mode, then download pycountry1.8, install pycountry1.8, copy the egg file to OpenBazaar directory, run the setup/install (edit the python 2.7 reference to 3.4 in the setup script). No errors. Run the setup/create windows exe...created an UNKNOWN-0.0.0.win-amd64.exeRan that, gave some sort of python install screen. Apparently something installed. And that's it. Nothing running.Am I missing something?I realize it is still in development so it is not ready for prime time but any documentation on how to install on windows would be great. Yes, it was announced before DefCon that they would be hacking brain wallets and advised everyone to get their coins out of their brainwallets.Even if you think you're super smart in your pass phrase, it can be hacked easier than a private key. Same here. I have the Transaction IDs as proof of payment.Their lack of response is disheartening. ftfy No there's not. It is a hypothetical that one person who does not like that idea brought up to make sure we approach the block size enhancement in a smart way (or else something stupid like raising the total supply could be pushed through in the same way). Whatever vote they believe will get them elected as president.People with money to donate to their presidential campaign. Use escrow services, multi-sig, all sorts of technology that make laws meaningless... Can't really nitpick the wording too much since most likely the original wording is in Japanese. Hmm, gambling with something that they see as having no value...I guess it would be allowed. Don't quote me on that though. If you're relying on the government to protect you when it comes to using Bitcoin, you're doing it wrong. The only thing you need to own a bitcoin is to hold the private key. The government cannot do anything to change that basic fact. http://www.coindesk.com/tokyo-court-bitcoin-not-subject-to-ownership-2/This is quite awesome. Set up exchanges, set up payment processors, set up whatever you want with Bitcoin in Japan. It is not covered under the law. Just a note from someone living in Germany where Bitcoin is treated as a currency. Any trading of the currency requires that you register as a foreign exchange dealer. Bitcoin is severely suppressed in Germany due to its classification as a currency. All of the candidates that will be running for president are out there. They ALL have a history.Decide how the candidates will be based on the decisions and actions they have made in the past when they weren't being paid for or the propaganda machine wasn't trying to paint a picture for you.The whole "I want to see how this candidate does to see if I will vote for him" crap is just stupid. You are a sheep. Don't vote.Just look into the histories and voting records and actions of each candidate. Do you like what they have done? Then vote for them.  Just help them go to BitPay and set up a merchant account. It's very simple, takes like 5 minutes.Then they can either use their smart phone or have a tablet for it. But if they use a tablet make sure they don't just load it then stick the tablet in the corner so it can die after a while and need to be re-charged the next time someone comes in asking to pay with bitcoins.Then you can go to coinmap.org and put them on there. I remember one summer when the price was sideways.
This makes sense. t0.com will be an exchange. They are set up to use Open Assets right now but could probably integrate Colu, Counterparty, Factom, etc. It might be transparent as to which protocol you are using.But each company will need to choose their protocol because once you choose it, you have to stick with it. I would agree. Yep...centralized database of property ownership. Avoid like the plague. I guess it's showing how Bitcoin can be used to bet in video games. Yep, if it were Atlas Shrugged the people who willfully stay ignorant of Bitcoin are the ones left behind to participate in their own destruction. We all get to move forward with our bitcoins leaving them behind.Who is John Galt? The biggest impact on Bitcoin usually comes when the country starts raiding bank accounts or if their currency will be impacted.Interesting development to watch though. Ahh, I see you went for it.Let us all know the villa to give the guy more business. The crypto is solid. Bitcoin will last centuries.Whether or not people use it is up to people. If it's an actual business just pay the deposit in bitcoins. Make sure to get confirmation via e-mail that he received the funds and you're good to go. When you arrive, pay the rest in bitcoins. What the hell people? Do you have any idea what OpenBazaar is? You have the option, you can just purchase from the shop and not deal with escrow, or you can include an escrow service. If a company creates a website to make products available then they can make it so that their customers use their escrow service.If you download the app you don't have to. It's just like with Bitcoin, it is safer and better to run your own client and take steps to protect yourself. Or, like many people, you use a web service which is not as good. People need to realize when your system is flawed, the person in charge of that system really does not matter. The next  hours are critical! I think the best way to get this technology off of the ground is if a few companies set up web interfaces to the products for the casual consumer. Of course they would have to be vigilant and not include any illegal items in their page.They could make their money either as escrow services or advertising on the site. That's supposed to be an endorsement? Some "breathing room"? I like Texas, I lived there while Perry was governor. I was even a Republican delegate at the state convention in 2008. I would probably live in Texas if I came back to the US. But Perry is about as fake of a politician as you can get. 5 years if forever Strange that you think I'm a liberal just because I know Perry is an empty shell/puppet.I don't hate him, I know that he has no chance of becoming president so he really does not matter. That's why I don't see his stance on Bitcoin as that big of a deal. Other than the fact that him talking about Bitcoin would probably hugely misrepresent it to people who listen to him and hear about Bitcoin for the first time. I'm down a few hundred thousand from last year, up a few hundred thousand from 2 years ago. A $3 or $600 loss is no big deal when you think of how much you'll be up this time next year. Perry is only bitcoin friendly as long as his handlers tell him he is bitcoin friendly. I would not put too much faith in any words coming out of his mouth. Actually I do need to sell some for cash because I cannot pay for things like food and rent and other local stuff with bitcoins (though I am about 90% of the way in convincing my landlord to take bitcoins, but I usually have a lot of extra cash).You can download Mycelium which allows you to advertise locally but I tried and only ever had one person contact me. You can also get on sites like craigslist and bookoo and let people know you have bitcoins for sale. In Berlin if there is a meetup you might meet people there that want bitcoins.Fortunately for me, when localbitcoins blocked Germany they did not get rid of all of the ads. So VPNs and tor and other connections to localbitcoins can find the ads. Though it created the affect of locking everyone in since you can't add or edit ads in Germany. I am now experiencing first hand how government intervention stifles competition and keeps prices high. My 10% rate is locked in and in one area I have no competition. In another area I only have one competitor who just happened to be 1% lower than me before the lockdown, so he gets most of the business in that area. Now that I have the debit card I had considered stopping localbitcoins sales because I want to get rid of my banks but getting 10% on sales brings in some decent spending money every month so it's hard to justify it. Had they not blocked Germany there would probably be more competition by now and the rate would not be worth my time. Plus I don't want to turn anyone away that wants bitcoins.Edit: Just found this localbitcoins alternative in Germany. http://bitcoin-treff.de/ 
Well I do know that Perry would do about as well as president as the last Texas governor turned president. And they are both about as intelligent.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uvmKnFY4uk http://mindwanderingsinsanantonio.blogspot.de/2010/10/how-much-power-does-governor-of-texas.htmlhttp://kut.org/post/why-lieutenant-governor-most-powerful-office-texas-and-who-wants-powerMost power lies with the Lieutenant governor: I remember that. Can you short Ether on Kraken? The Texas governor position is more of an ambassador role and has no real power so they just put up empty suits with a southern drawl and who can act like a cowboy.Any success Texas had while he was governor had more to do with the price of oil going up to around $150 per barrel while he was governor than anything he did. His getting paid by Merk to force teenage girls to get vaccinated for a specific strain of STD (that they later discovered causes cancer) is about as much as he ever did as governor.Not worried about him becoming president anyway. His mouth will make sure that doesn't happen (same with Trump). Yes, I believe they have meetups at Room 77 every month.Germany considers bitcoin a currency. Pretty awesome right? Not so much. In order to trade bitcoins professionally you need a foreign exchange license which probably costs a lot of money. Germany considered localbitcoins as a foreign currency exchange and asked them to get licensed and legal. Localbitcoins instead opted to block the website from German IP addresses (hint hint).I was referring to this link:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0No I don't mind. You might also want to check out http://www.bit-x.comIt's a debit card that you can hold a bitcoin balance and pay anywhere that Mastercard is accepted and it takes it out of your bitcoin balance. It charges a 1% fee however but might be useful in an emergency.There are probably a lot of people in Berlin who can help. I live near Frankfurt where Bitcoin use is still very rare (maybe because the European Central Bank is there?). Clever. Pump your alt coin in the Bitcoin section by asking how it will affect BTC price.Well played    So much about the hype about Ethereum being a Bitcoin add on and not a competing currency.Color me shocked.   I live in Germany and am paid in bitcoins. You have the advantage of living in Berlin because they have a Bitcoin sector where most of the shops take bitcoins.For me it is more about dropping my bank so I mainly deal with bitcoins and cash. If you have bitcoins in Germany there are a lot of people who will pay euros for them. Unfortunately, localbitcoins dropped Germany from advertising. But if you can find a way to get the word out you will get people to pay for them. I know a guy that is getting 15% markup from one person. I didn't ask anything further about it. I get 9-10%.I pay for cash for most things like food and all of that but I use bitcoins for as much as I can. See my signature for a link to many of the services I use regularly. You used to be able to get delivery via lieferservice.de but they are dragging their feet after a merger.If you can find a place to live via 9flats.com then you're well on your way.There is also this site https://www.all4btc.com/ based out of Berlin for buying things online and this http://about.bitwa.la/launch/ for paying bills online. I checked on that also since I have been looking hard at the colored coin protocols. Chain is using Open Assets and have said that they are open to using other colored coin protocols in the future.  But once a company chooses one protocol it is very difficult to change. You can't just move the shares over, you'd have to create an exchange from the old protocol to the new one since people can only move their shares with their private key.I like the Colu colored coin protocol but it appears that Open Assets has a big first out of the gate advantage and network effect. If NASDAQ and Overstock and several other companies are using Open Assets then if you want to integrate easily in the future then you will need to be using Open Assets.  Stability is different. Costs more money to get fiat into btc-e.SEPA transfer: Fee:    15eur People say the grass is greener on the other side.The reality is that the grass is greener where you water it. Same arguments happened in 2012 before the first halving.Unfortunately it was true. All miners stopped mining and Bitcoin ceased to be.RIP With over $700 million in VC funds so far this year, there is likely an expected return of at least that much money in return via the Bitcoin businesses they invested in. So $360 million is certainly quite feasible. Nowhere in the definition of money does it include the ability to prevent crimes.That is what police are for. Maybe focus on updating the ancient police system? Bitcoin is taking care of updating the ancient money system. Or Freicoin.Or BBQcoin I have been not so quietly accumulating.You can create a chart for me and it would show 2013: some bitcoins  2014: more bitcoins  2015: even more bitcoins Here is a good calculator to let you see what the price will be as Bitcoin starts to take a foothold in various markets. If you look at the fees, it is mainly from the bank fees (1% for POS and 3% for ATM).So there is very little wiggle room the Bitcoin card companies have to play with. Also, it is usually an easy giveaway of someone who has no clue when they call it BitCoin or Bit Coin.
Probably the same way the phone companies took advantage of mobile phone technology. Adapt and survive.Start offering Bitcoin services. We'll probably have to stick around the 290s for a week or so before we move easily over 300. At that point it will be a solid move and we won't see the 200s again (except that one freak day where everyone's panicking for whatever reason, then we rocket to the moon). If you're relying on other people's ethics or goodwill for your coin to survive, you might as well put a bullet in it right now.Cryptocurrency is considered trustless. I don't have to trust that you sent me the money. I can verify it and see that it happened. I don't have to trust people not to do a 51% attack. I can see that it would be extremely difficult to do so. https://bit-x.com/guide/bitx-cardsCommissions & feesFees    BIT-X commission    Bank commissionCard activation    0.05 BTC    -Card delivery via airmail    0.05 BTC    -Card delivery via DHL    0.30 BTC    -Monthly fee - FREE for the first 10000 users    0.02 BTC    -Cash withdrawal at ATM    0.01 BTC    3%Payments (POS)    0.002 BTC    1% That is why no viable PoW competitor to Bitcoin can ever exist.It is not a matter of ethics, it is a matter of return on investment. Once an alt coin is put on a trading platform that allows for shorting, if it is PoW then a mining pool can easily decide to short that alt coin and 51% attack it to pretty much destroy it before going back to mining bitcoins.Same with Litecoin and PoS. The most powerful will win out. Join their signature campaign then post nonsense in every thread. In the early days there would be threads about how easily the banks could just buy enough hardware to do a 51% attack, or some government or the Federal Reserve.Not so many threads along those lines anymore... I just ordered one after seeing that they got rid of the inactivity fee. I was hesitant because of the huge signature campaign and for some reason I have equated signature campaigns with scammers, maybe because of the amount of people who post just for their signature campaign.As for a 1% spending fee. Just realize that for the majority of Bitcoin's lifespan the price has tended in an upward direction. The fact that it is a limited supply means this will always true if it is adopted as a means of spending money. So consider the price of Bitcoin between when you were paid and when you went to spend your money. Has the price gone up?The last time I was paid the price was $281/BTC. At the price of $283.81/BTC any spending with the card would equal the 1% fee. At the current ($288/BTC) price anything I spend is more than I received in my paycheck. And if the price goes down...I hold off on spending until it either goes up or after my next paycheck when I'm buying lower.I used my ANX debit card for the first time this week. It worked but not as well as the bit-x card. I put $250 on it when the price was $245/BTC and it gave me a rate of $235/BTC. A rate that's way too high and it locks your dollar amount in.As for those that don't want to spend your bitcoins...does that mean you are spending your fiat? Instead of buying bitcoins with that fiat? I think you should seriously stick with fiat currency. It seems more up your alley. Everyone knows that's not going anywhere. Trust your government to do what's right.  Downloaded a bittorrent pdf of a few. Not all that impressed. There are several people talking about big events happening in mid September/October (other than Octoberfest).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkELgi6EkNoThis one focusing on the "Shimitah" which is a jewish date that happens every 7 years where major things are supposed to happen. And this September is the 7th 7 year date in the cycle.Also for October there is a theory that a new reserve currency will be announced October 20th by the IMF. Can't yet.  I can absolutely 100% guarantee that at least one government will use Bitcoin as its currency. Huh? Package? Address?Why are you here on a Bitcoin forum again?not that I care/ignore We were in the 270s for too long. Time to take this 280 range for a spin. Heading on a Caribbean cruise in the spring. The room I got is just over $3k for 2 people. So just over 10 bitcoins at today's rates.I have the same second thoughts spending both fiat and bitcoins. It is the same thing.If you were to buy the same cruise from your bank account, if in 2 years BTC is 10k each wouldn't you be kicking yourself for not spending that money on bitcoins instead?I rarely spend money. When I do it is to enjoy life, I don't buy things.As I am about 98% in Bitcoin, it is the main currency that I use. I contacted Cheapair.com and Expedia and they both replied that they do not do cruises.Ships and Trips travel works so that's good. At least there is one. You can make a phone call by going to a website and paying in bitcoins without signing up.You can send money worldwide for less than pennies.You can use your cell phone to pay for things instead of carrying around a phone AND a wallet.You don't have to worry about identity theft with your cards.You can vote anonymously and securely.
When depositing funds via SEPA do I deposit into the provided Belize account number or the Antigua account number? 42 out of 51...got a bit lazy toward the end when the questions were getting harder (more mining centric).I got thrown off when I missed the trade volume one. Just worded weird. Nice, now I'll sign up. So I found 2 places that could book my cruise for me in bitcoin.The first http://www.southafrica.to was decent but they're based out of South Africa and I think the currency exchange added a few percent to the price so their price was a few hundred dollars higher.The one I ended up using is http://shipsandtripstravel.com. After getting the cruise picked out they sent me the payment form and I chose "cash", then the agent wanted my credit card for the deposit and I told her I don't have one and I can only pay in Bitcoin. She talked to her manager then came back saying they don't accept bitcoin as payment.So I replied to the e-mail with this link from their webpage: http://shipsandtripstravel.com/lagniappe/bitcoin-travel/The post is from January 2014 so they obviously set up the payment a long time ago and haven't had people pay in bitcoin since. She contacted the IT guy and he sent me a BitPay link for the payment.I contacted about 20 different local agents in Florida asking if they'd accept Bitcoin. The only ones that replied said that their franchise contract only allows them to accept credit cards or certified check/money order.I did some research and found that I can pay cash for stuff on the cruise ship, you just deposit $500 or so for the week and pay at the end. I can use localbitcoins when I get back to the US to get cash, I can even use localbitcoins at the small islands so I can pay for things in the local currency (which is usually cheaper).Now to start contacting companies about paying for excursions with bitcoins  I use Bitcoin for remittance from US to Germany.The guys in the office who have the same pay setup usually pay around 5% to get euros. But they do it through their bank. They have to pay an international wire transfer fee plus they exchange rate they give is always a few percentage off of the real exchange rate.I get paid in bitcoins through BitWage and charge 10% to sell bitcoins via localbitcoins.Ideally for those in the Philippines or anywhere else for that matter they would do something similar. The person in the US could choose to get a percentage of their paycheck direct deposited into bitcoins. Then their family back home could set up a business selling bitcoins, even for just 1-2% and they come out ahead while providing a good service to the locals who want to buy bitcoins at a good rate.I always have a lot more people buying bitcoins with euros than I can spend in a month, so I just deposit the extra in the bank and buy more bitcoins. Though people need to remember, there are over 500,000 Western Union locations in the world. They're not going down any time soon, if just for the convenience of it.One guy here at work sends money to his ex-wife via Western Union. He's into bitcoins and has some and we tried to figure out how he could do the same thing using bitcoins. But his ex always wants that money the same day. She could probably do localbitcoins but I think he'd rather pay the extra money than deal with fighting with her over it. Yes, nothing happened after the first halving when the price was $9 because it was priced in. Nothing happened soon after that. Can't fight science. If it's on Amazon you can get it for a discount by paying with bitcoins. At least 5%. On average around 20%. President Paul's second term won't end until 2025. Because even the bears realize we'll never go under $200 again. Do tell...which selected altsdid you invest in, now you need to push them on Bitcoin threads The way I do it for bills is that I am paid every 2 weeks, if I get paid on Friday and the price goes down I cut back my spending for that 2 weeks. If I absolutely have to, I just pay my bills on that next Friday.But what I have noticed is that at some point in those 2 weeks the price is higher than when I got paid. When that happens I pay for things I have been putting off. While people are posting pictures of rockets and trains, I'm paying bills.And the Bitcoin price doesn't fluctuate all that much lately.  The benefit is having the option of dropping your bank account. By setting it up on a regular basis you take advantage of dollar cost averaging which is a safer way to convert your currency.My purchases spread out over the first 6 months of the year buying once every 2 weeks when my paycheck went through averages $245/BTC. That's with the start of the year being over $300/BTC. Nodes don't accept double spend transactions. If they were in close proximity it would be known within seconds.Satoshi said that after 6 minutes it is reasonable for all the nodes in the network to have your transaction.About the only way to successfully do a double spend is to spend at the same time as someone on the other side of the world. The transaction would populate all of the nodes in close proximity within seconds, moving on to other countries with more delay until finally reaching the other side of the world closer to a minute or so.I still believe most merchants will use a payment processor, even when keeping it in Bitcoin. They enjoy the services of having their wallet up to date, accounting software included, the option of converting to fiat, etc.You would probably have to run out of the building and hope there are no cameras in order to execute a double spend for your small purchase. Same as just grabbing everything and running out the door. Actively holding. Are you using BitWage (http://www.bitwage.co) to get any of your salary converted to bitcoins?If so, how much?Doing a quick calculation, after the next halving if just 4000 people with an average salary of $1k per week were getting paid in bitcoins (at a price of $300) we would have money flowing into the Bitcoin ecosystem equal to the amount of every miner cashing out all of their bitcoins.That's not counting new people discovering Bitcoin and buying some. This used to be all theoretical and we would discuss it over and over much like we are in this thread.But you can already use bitcoins in stores and restaurants. It happens all the time. No need to theorize. Satoshi's response to the block size debate.Also: $1650 by the end of 2020 I don't invest in gold because I don't have enough money to afford a full bar of gold. 3 people coordinating to steal 50...or, one person just steals 50 worth of stuff and runs out.Especially in bars, and restaurants you are usually there for a few minutes anyway. And just about every place I have paid in person has used a third party service like BitPay or another local processor.So more than likely the three shops in your scenario will use the same processor. They see 3 payments coming through from the same address and drop the second 2.If you want to get elaborate with stealing 50 with 3 people, one guy pays with his credit card, another guy climbs on the roof to block the satellite connection of the payment and the third guy for lookout.Most people who complain about the long transaction times for in person payment have never paid in person. Try it. You'll see how simple it is.
True...the dichotomy of a teen being able to understand Bitcoin but not grasping Bittorrent. Credit cards do the transaction in seconds. The confirmation time is at least 180 days.The only reason to wait for confirmation with Bitcoin is to ensure there is no double spend. Almost mathematically impossible after 6 confirmations, reasonably unlikely after 3, fairly safe after just 1.Credit cards can be "double spent" up to 180 days from the transaction for very little reason at all (just claim you didn't make that purchase, it's on the merchant to prove you did). Transaction time != confirmation time.Transactions take seconds. Paying for a hamburger does not require someone to worry about you doing a double spend which requires waiting 10 minutes.I have even done localbitcoins transactions of a few hundred euros and as soon as the person saw the unconfirmed transaction on the network (within seconds) we shake hands and go on our way. https://www.bitquick.co/Deposit cash into someone's bank account. Get bitcoins. Get paid weekly allowance in bitcoins.Download the latest boy band music with bitcoins.Get the hottest new game with bitcoins.In an emergency (or someone forgot to pick you up), text dad that you need money to pay for an Uber ride to get home. I do it all the time. The transaction takes seconds. Developers and beta testers will have higher ratings so they are getting early adopter advantage. There will also be companies like OB1 (made up of OpenBazaar developers) that will be doing escrow. Initially people will need to prove themselves in the real world to ensure their trust.Like I would post a link on here to my OpenBazaar address. You would see that I am not a n00b and it is against my interests to scam people. When shopping for a laptop on a network with no customer service will you choose to buy one cheaper from the guy with 0 sales and a 0 rating or the guy with 200 sales and a 100% rating?See how long that guy's business will keep his 100% rating if he starts sending a box of sand. Ahh...Green Party in the UK.I was thinking of the Green Party of the US which is basically people who love communism but don't like being linked to the baggage of the millions of people who died under those systems. So they change their name to Green Party or progressism. Yes, a colored coin might work in such an instance. The key is having the option.Then you're just doing something you enjoy, not working. My idea of retirement is running my own business on my terms. Freicoin was created as an inflationary coin.Haven't heard of it? Ya...because nobody would voluntarily start using a currency made to lose value.Any small community creating their own coin is vulnerable to a 51% attack by anyone who wants to disrupt their community. Same as ebay customer service does. Scanned receipts, pictures of the item, delivery tracking, etc. Then finally there's the rating system. As a former ebay merchant, if I used to eat some bad transactions because I valued the 100% rating more than the money I lost. For me being rich is having enough money to last the rest of my life without working plus having no debt with my home paid off and self sustaining utilities. Then having enough money in an investment that gives me an income of a few thousand dollars a month to live on.Once I hit that point I will retire. Bitcoin is a cure for communism so I can imagine it did not go over well at a Communist Party meeting.They do not want a currency that is fair, they want one that gets distributed (stopping first in their pockets so they can determine who is worthy).Decentralization is the antithesis of people who want power to be centralized.Even though the Green Party is just a front for their true passion of communism and they don't really care about the environment, here is a detailed breakdown of the carbon footprint of Bitcoin's PoW system:http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-conclusions-costs-bitcoin/The good news is that those types of people are typically not early adopters so they will be left with their fiat to the bitter end. Complaining the whole way down. The next closest thing to a government declaring Bitcoin as a currency would be if the entry/exit for that government's currency had a third party service that converted from government currency to bitcoins.For the theft part of government, imagine paying your taxes in bitcoins. This would be fairly easy for a company to take bitcoins for your tax payment and convert it to government currency to send in.On the distribution part you could have a company that accepts government checks and converts it to bitcoins for companies and people.Once that happens, the rest of the economy has no reason to still use the government's currency. Everyone can use bitcoins because they are neither required to convert it to pay their taxes and if they are receiving funds they can get it in bitcoins.The closer to the source the better. Right now, in the US, the Federal Reserve fills this role with the Treasury. If Bitcoin could be converted for everything going in and out of the Treasury then it would be as close to adopting Bitcoin as the national currency as possible. Switching over would not be that big of a leap. Sucks that they went after you in the first place, glad it is in your rear view mirror now. I wish you and your family the best. The same as it should feel if you spend your fiat on something other than bitcoins before the price goes up.When people hear about Lazlo spending 10,000 bitcoins on a pizza back in 2010 they usually say "damn, he's probably kicking himself right now".Well, why aren't you kicking yourself right now for not buying 10,000 bitcoins for $25 back then? It's the same thing. He could have spent $25 on a pizza or 10,000 bitcoins on a pizza. Or he could have spent $25 on 10,000 bitcoins.So if you spend some bitcoins on something, then the price goes up. Don't worry about it. Would you have spent fiat on that thing? Fiat that could have been used to buy bitcoins... About 15,000 bitcoins have been borrowed and sold in the hopes that they can be bought back cheaper. The only way that happens is if people believe that the lower price is due to anything and they also sell. We should all jump on the short bandwagon!Nothing but profits right?
US woke up, had their cup of coffee and checked to see if Greece went ahead with their capitulating to the EU.Low price probably won't last past when I get paid on Friday though :/  Don't listen to anyone here. Go to your local police station and they will explain it to you. Please post where Satoshi said he was abandoning Bitcoin in disgust. According to this article, the number is closer to 280,000 at the end of 2013 when there was a lot of activity:http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/who-owns-all-the-bitcoins-an-infographic-of-wealth-distribution/2015/01/24According to this the Gini is .877 (back in 2014)https://twitter.com/mbauwens/status/447715800481542144You also have to factor in 12% inflation currently. I'm not leaving my job, just the bank. With Bitwage I can get my paychecks in bitcoins through my direct deposit.I considered leaving my job when the price was higher last year but I figured it would be good to keep my job as a fall back. Turns out that was a smart choice. I was able to stock up on more bitcoins when the price dropped.But I still consider myself semi-retired. I started to travel at least once a month which is fine with a 3 day weekend here and there. And by "retired" I mean not doing what I am currently doing. I will always work but hopefully I can do something I enjoy as opposed to just making money. We all need to work toward being able to drop our banks. Just chip away at those last few things that you're stuck using banks for until you can drop them completely.I am a month away from not using my bank ever again. I will wait until the end of year just to be sure, then drop it. As time goes on and people protect their keys better it is unlikely that the feds will have many more auctions. So I am looking at Open Assets, Colu and CoinSpark for handling stock sales (not looking for Alt coin solutions, do not advertise in this thread). Here's where I stand on each one.Open Assets:positives-Simple, it has a lot of support, Gyft and Overstock are using it as are several other ventures.negatives-I don't tend to see a lot of activity on it in the past few months Colu:positives- Released their new protocol, similar to Open Assets but has support for storing meta data in torrents which is great for further decentralization.They own coloredcoins.org which people likely assume is the central place for all colored coins so it might become the new standard based on just that.negatives-Someone on their Skype board mentioned writing an alt coin for the protocol(?). I'm not sure what that's about but I'd hate for it to evolve into a Counterparty/NXT type of solution.CoinSpark:potitives-Similar to Open Assets, seems to be used quite a bit and I like that it is written in programming languages that I know well.negatives-Does not seem to be adopted as much as Open Assets and doesn't have a web client (which I might just write myself anyway so not that big of a deal).Are you considering using one of the protocols or do you use one already? What are your thoughts on each one?*Again, not interested in Counterparty,NXT,Ethereum,Factom or any other alt coin solution. Posts about solutions other than these 3 will be deleted.* Where did you get that private key OP? Aaaannnnndddd it's gone. Holy $2 million wall on Bitstamp at $295.Bearwhalebull is back! I don't believe there are 1 million holders.A lot of people go buy wallet downloads but I have personally downloaded the wallet several times. You have to figure just the amount of people that have upgraded to a new computer or just download it thinking they are downloading some magic money program onto their computer.Is there a way to calculate a minimum per holder? I would imagine each person would hold at least .001 or so. Closer to .5 That's his conclusion at the bottom of OP. Bitcoin is made up of early adopters with a large percentage in the world's top 1% (most Americans fall in that category). This would likely put us at a higher than world average. I think we jumped over $300 just because so many people wanted it.We need to cross it with some more stability behind it like we are building now. Did you seriously just answer a topic subject on the second page of threads thinking nobody had mentioned BitPay?Oh wait...signature campaign.Carry on with your worthless posts for money. How do you do that from your mobile wallet? Your blockchain.info wallet? Xapo?The typical approach is to create a new address for each customer on the website. When you go to pay you get a unique address tied to your order and shipping address. When money goes into that address you know that the purchase has gone through.Sites like BitPay create that functionality for you with a simple button. If you make less than $500,000 the transactions are free. So it's a no brainer to just add a button from them.Or you can write the code yourself or, as has been pointed out, use an opencart plugin.Most companies prefer BitPay or Coinbase because they convert a percentage of the bitcoins immediately into fiat. Imagine you are moving from the US to Europe. Would you feel safe converting your entire savings to euros?Converting to bitcoins is a similar move. I think this is the best route...individual agencies.Here is the response I received from btctrip:Thank you for contacting BtcTrip.
You sell a widget with your Bitcoin address below. I send my bitcoins to that address. Someone else claims they sent bitcoins to that address.Who do you ship the widget to? At the least the Greek people need to look at alternative currencies. Let their government hold the bag. The mean is closer to $400. Yes, I use egifter and gyft for ebay purchases.Being able to buy things on Amazon and eBay with bitcoins covers a whole lot of things I would ever want to buy on the Internet. Agreement was made to open up talks again. Not for a bailout. I prefer using purse.io to get 20-35% off of my Amazon purchases (can do up to 50% but have never had such an order filled).Just bought a laptop on Amazon (Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 20A70037US):List Price:    $2,099.00Price:    $1,499.99 & FREE ShippingYou Save:    $599.01Purse Price$1229.4Paid with bitcoins Still a bull market medium and long term. Staying above $240 takes us out of the bear market. Plastics A few years ago I suggested someone contact the CEO of Overstock because he seemed like someone that would be interested due to his open support of Ron Paul. Someone in the thread was able to get through to him and the rest is history.You never know. I e-mailed CheapAir and they are a no-go for booking a cruise. E-mailed Expedia but will likely get the same response. I see that I could buy a gift certificate for Carnival on egifter but I am looking to book a cruise with Royal Carribean for next spring.The few travel websites I have found on google that accept Bitcoin no longer exist.Is there a way to book a cruise with bitcoins?Edit: found two solutions, http://www.southafrica.to and http://shipsandtripstravel.com I used several payment services the past few days and they all eventually went through even though the transaction showed that it had timed out. Strange. I only made one trade (my initial buy) yet the chart shows a lower amount:27   Elwar   -   0.32072   $99.34   -0.66%                Well well, looks like we're back to the price of the first day we started this.All of the buy/holders are sitting back around $100  I just sold..8 on localbitcoins  And Deutsche Bank sent me my "we're cancelling your account because we can" notice.Bitcoins + cash from localbitcoins = Bitcoin user not affected. lol...bag holder The charts are pretty this morning. I use more cash now that I've switched to bitcoin than I ever have. It's interesting that Ron Paul's campaign pretty much turned me from politically active (even running for Congress) to leaving all of that behind and finding my way forward outside of all of that noise.Though a lot of that may be thanks to Bitcoin as well. That is pretty sweet. I had never heard of this service. I am sure a competitor will likely come out with the option to pay in bitcoins like airbnb's competitor 9flats I wonder if someone set up a bot to buy more based on the amount of Bitcoin transactions on the network 
I have done pretty well at not needing a credit or debit card for anything, always finding a bitcoin option for my purchase but one thing I keep thinking about is rental cars and how that could be handled without a credit or debit card.In theory I guess the credit card is so that you don't just drive off with the car or if you wreck it you have to pay for it. I'm not really sure how that works when it really happens and you don't have a very high limit or you don't have the money. I guess they can at least go after you for the money somehow.Can anyone think of a solution for renting a car with bitcoins?The most practical would be something where some company rents the car for you, they use a credit card and get insurance on the car being stolen or damaged. You pay the extra insurance. Maybe they can even hold some bitcoins from you in escrow to cover any deductible or other fees. They do the know your customer thing and verify that you are who you are and not someone who's just going to steal the car. And you only get to rent the cheaper vehicles, no luxury cars.The high end route would be to put in multisig escrow the cost of buying the car that you are renting. You pay to rent it and then when it is returned in good condition the company releases the escrow back to you.I can see the first being more likely. I imagine that some day I will likely need a rental car and would like to find a solution before then.  Perhaps this chart can clear things up:    /__/ rocket train moon and such! When I used to do loans I would refresh it on my own but that takes a lot of time and effort to keep up with it. Rolling it over does it for you so you don't miss out on the time it takes for you to get an e-mail and do it manually. I'm not sure which is better. Different for everyone. What is "SWITCH TO BPI ON JULY 15 !!!"?Edit: nvm, found ithttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=890086.msg11837654#msg11837654 I don't worry about spending bitcoins.Would you have felt better if you had spent dollars on those items instead?Those same dollars that could have been used to buy bitcoins before the price went up... Closest I came to that was buying a power cable for the computer that has all of my litecoin on it.I'm fine with keeping the litecoins I bought back in 2013. I always wanted 1000 of a coin, I was able to do so with litecoin  I support whatever was said in this post that I did not have a chance to read yet. The Litecoin market is not big enough to push Bitcoin up $15 by dropping Litecoin by $2.  I'm not sure, I just signed up for the BitShare service and they also offer a link to a Xapo debit card so I signed up for that. I would think that each has their own fees, I will verify after trying them out. Woke up this morning and checked my phone and it showed 244. I was like...holy shit, that dude was right, what happened!?!Then I looked up and saw the chart was for euros. Had me for a second. Bitcoin is actually fairly boring compared to LTC, PPC, NMC, Chinese stock exchange, NYSE...Is Bitcoin now the non-volatile investment? I'm in a country where I don't pay taxes but not on a boat yet. Working toward something like that...As for the average being higher, BitWage just released the following info:If the price goes into bubble territory I can split some of my paycheck into gold/silver or some other currency. "CL: Because Litecoin is an altcoin and a much smaller market cap, the Litecoin price is extremely volatile. So when the crypto currency market is crashing, it gets hit a lot harder than Bitcoin. And when it's going up, Litecoin does extremely well."So buying or selling an alt coin is like buying or selling bitcoins on margin. Are you saying that if you could spend your bitcoins on Amazon then more people would buy bitcoins so they could use their bitcoins to buy things on Amazon?What if they gave like a 5% discount for buying items on Amazon? Would you use bitcoins for your Amazon purchases then? So I just did an average price check for my first six months of getting paid in bitcoin.Here are the prices for each paycheck for 6 months, once every 2 weeks (BitWage sends an e-mail with the amount of bitcoins and the price so keeping track is easy):$319$212$231$241$257$295$251$238$234$240$239$227$249Final average: $246/BTC Here is an interesting tool for modeling the bitcoin price based upon many factors.http://worldbitcoinnetwork.com/BitcoinPriceModel-Alpha.htmlWhat price does your model configuration show? Translation? Bitcoin is 11.50?!?!? LTC follows Bitcoin's price. They refer to it as Litecoin is the silver to Bitcoin's gold.I bought a bunch of LTC and PPC back in 2013. Not enough to change my life but enough to check the price every once in a while. I don't really see them being used for much though.
I think LTC is just catching up. It dropped way too low during the bear market (back to 2012 prices). There will be big money behind selling the fact that the economy is in the pooper in 2016 portraying Obama as the one at fault. Both sides will be pushing that storyline to get their guy in front. This is never good for the stock market. Look at what happened in 2008 running up to the elections.Not saying it isn't true, but instead of selling people toothpaste and potato chips on TV they will be selling a bad economy. The only reason Litecoin is rising so much quicker than Bitcoin is because it has such a smaller market cap. When the price dropped, it also fell a lot lower than Bitcoin. I bought a bunch of Litecoin back in 2013 for about $3 each when Bitcoin was around $100. It went up to $50 at Bitcoin's $1200 peak and just a few months ago at it's lowest it was under $2.Litecoin is Bitcoin's volatile little brother. So I figured I'd check on old Wall posts around June 11 before the price started moving up (around $230).Most of the talk was about how boring the price was but this was interesting:https://mobile.twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/608999235149692929"I think I have convinced Russia that Bitcoin is equivalent to Gold and that CBR (Central Bank of Russia) should be loading up on BTC." -Max KeiserThough I have no respect for the Keiser. I wonder if there is some truth to this.  Over the 3 day weekend I took a trip to Poland. Instead of using the exchanges like I usually do, I checked on localbitcoins for a seller. I arranged to meet him about an hour after I arrived at my hotel. He met me in the lobby and I sold enough bitcoins to get the local currency for the weekend.My hotel was paid for through Expedia and my plane ticket paid with cheapair.com.I even had lunch at a restaurant that accepts Bitcoin. All in all, a fun weekend paid for with bitcoins. Ahh, I see now. I was able to translate the article. So sort of like the ETF we're waiting for in the US.I was thinking it was like an ATM or something. My localbitcoin business is safe. There goes my localbitcoins business.What is an ETN? First time we have been up on the 6 month chart in over a year. Ya, all of these banks acting like they have their own version of Bitcoin. Even though it's centralized and pre-mined.In other words, they have come up with the idea of using a ledger for keeping track of their accounts. Genius! Over the course of about a month on the way down we stayed around that number for a few days at a time. We spent about 2 weeks bouncing around $666 in a bull run after dropping below $350. That pretty much stopped the run and it was down from there. It will take a lot to push it out of the $266 range. Maybe Greece dropping the Euro will do it.But then the next big stop will be $666. Breaking through that will be a challenge. The banks are kinda out of money...They defaulted on their payments to the Eurpean Central Bank. Greek banks are essentially finished. It will likely be $500,000 next week.And I am willing to loan anyone 1 bitcoin now for only $100,000 as a down payment. Rock bottom interest of only 1% APR!!!! $50k at least. All countries will adopt Bitcoin by Christmas. You heard it here. The pattern is the magic number $266.We might be stuck here for a while if nothing pushes it up quickly. I stopped by Bobby Berger, it was quite cool to pay with bitcoins. I ended up getting a chip for my phone at the airport so no problems with Internet. Stopped by Five Restaurant too (they were listed on coinmap as accepting bitcoins), they do not accept bitcoin.Many thanks to Nuke on localbitcoins for hooking me up with some zloty. I guess I should have self moderated this thread. It wasn't meant to be a platform for bringing Alt coin discussions to the Bitcoin forum. Yep, could already do that with Bitcoin for over a year.Just about anything these alt coins think they're bringing to the table can be done with Bitcoin. And it has the benefit of the network effect and it's the most secure ledger in the world.I am looking at Bitcoin solutions. Not alt coins. Every NXT person I have talked to basically wants Bitcoin to fail. Cool, thanks a lot. Do they both have wifi so I don't have to buy a sim card for the weekend for my phone?
The only poll that matters is the amount of people that download and use Bitcoin XT.People invested in alt coins need not worry about which wallet Bitcoin users are using.  huh?now I am confused source? This chick thinks her friend is the first to bring up this theory:http://cointelegraph.com/news/114713/is-bitcoin-the-mark-of-the-beast-op-ed Just curious, is there a reason there is not a Java version of this? Then you would have a Windoze client easily. Nope.Next! I have a feeling we'll be back to my $300 purchase on January 1 fairly soon. Ahh I see now...Someone sold too low and now wants the price to drop again to buy back in.  FUD about some Gavin conspiracy won't bring down the price. Buy in now, the bear market is over. The alert keys for core and xt are the same. XT is the same as Core except the added feature that when there is a consensus agreement, then the block size will increase.Are you against the consensus of Bitcoin users agreeing on an upgrade? Or would you rather leave that to a centralized group of people? One week holding well in the $230s, another week holding strong in the $240s...looks like this is the week of the $250s. Looks like a solid trend.  I am working on a business that will need to issue stocks in the next few months. I would like to use the magic of the Bitcoin blockchain to record these stocks as it is the most secure ledger in the world.As I delve into the world of colored coins it can get rather confusing. There is no single "colored coin" standard, just a few different approaches that are not compatible with one another. Some stray far away from Bitcoin almost to the point of creating their own alt coin. A few are completely Bitcoin blockchain based. Those are the ones I prefer as I am most confident in Bitcoin.The main protocol I am leaning toward is Open Assets. It uses the OP_RETURN of a transaction to include 20 bytes of data which includes the amount of stocks transferred and a URL link to some meta data to help with visualizing the asset. Very simple and clean, not a lot of overhead for the blockchain and it already has several implementations including an offline and online wallet. Most importantly, Overstock and NASDAQ are using this protocol for their attempts at stocks on the blockchain.The latest protocol released is from Colu at coloredcoins.org which promises more features such as bittorrent compatability (useful for not relying on a central web server to store meta data) and a few other things. But it is in its early phase and I do not know much about the actual protocol yet.Others such as Factom, Counterparty and Ethereum seem very altcoinish. With some even ripping on Bitcoin in their white papers, so I have no confidence in them.I read one article where Mike Hearn says he is not a big fan of colored coins using the Bitcoin blockchain as a way to store assets, calling it a lazy approach. I am curious about why it would be considered a lazy approach and what would be a more sophisticated approach. I would think that using the Bitcoin blockchain for assets gives it more intrinsic value such that even if the price drops, Bitcoin would still be necessary for many other things (like gold being useful as jewelry).Has anyone else looked into this much? What are your opinions on the different approaches?  Greece owed the European Central Bank a few million euros last week. They defaulted on that payment. That's what the whole "extensions" were about last week. Since they did not make that payment the ECB cut off further funds which was the reason for the bank closures.I am not sure of what the consequences of defaulting on the IMF would be, there have only been 3 other countries in history that have defaulted (Argentina, Jamaica and Equador).They owe the ECB 3.5 billion euros in July. Merkel just announced that the terms for their bailout end at midnight.So the vote is worthless at this point. This could be worse than Greece. Greece doesn't pay the IMF and the IMF will just have to deal with it.Japan doesn't pay the banks and pensions and it hits its own citizens. Double hit. I was getting so much work done during the bear market. Even if Greece gets the bailout...they are just getting a loan so they can make a payment on their previous loan. And this new loan will come with more payments and interest, which will require another bailout in a year or so to pay their loan payment and on and on...collapse now or collapse later, either one...Bitcoin can wait At least the bitcoin price is exciting again.
Placement in a high traffic location requires money to rent the space which would require higher fees at the ATM which would discourage its use. Some Bitcoin user that has a small shop can easily add a Bitcoin ATM to their shop with a few thousand dollars. Placing it in an airport not only requires a lot of money but also a lot of red tape with the airport and possibly exposure to some required currency exchange regulations that would easily be ignored in some small shop. I think we're taking our first steps into the bull market. This is new territory for a lot of people and it has been such a long time since we have been here. $266 was the high price during the first bubble of 2013. It was a psychological barrier going down because we had never fallen before a previous "bubble high". It might take some effort to push above it. The reason they are limiting withdrawals is because the European Central Bank stopped the flow of fiat to Greece. The banks have limited funds so they do not want a bank run to the point that they all go broke. I can see some of it coming from Greece.Coinbase has an exchange in Greece. People in Greece can only make SEPA transfers within Greece. So if you have a bunch of money in your bank that you can't get out...send it to Coinbase to buy bitcoins before the banks seize it. Interesting. I haven't logged into my account there for a while. Logged in and had quite a few coins there.Was going to sell for a higher price and transfer to my other account but noticed I never set up a withdrawal for EUR.With that wide of a spread I figure it's safer to take those coins off and put them in cold storage. That's discouraging considering Open Assets has several wallets and both Gemini and NASDAQ are using that protocol. It would seem that they are the front runner in the world of adoption.I have a business I would like to implement a colored coin protocol for to issue stocks but I don't want to implement something for a company that plans to be around for decades but get stuck with everyone's stocks on some alt colored coin that will have no support in a few years. Most of the block size threads are alt coin losers trying to make it look like Bitcoin has some inherent flaw.The block size limit was added as a band-aid fix against spam and can easily be changed as needed.End of story. Odwiedzam ten weekend i chciałbyś spędzić bitcoins a ja jestem tam.*tłumacz Google* The volatility in the alt coins is higher than BTC.Bitcoin has matured enough that the swings are not that huge. When Bitcoin drops the alts drop a lot but nobody is on here showing the huge losses. Um...the alerts are just a feature of the Bitcoin Core wallet. If abused, a few lines of code are deleted and a new wallet released. Or you use another wallet without the alert message.It's basically a way to send a message to all of the wallets in case of an emergency. Like what happened in 2013 where we had to have a hard fork immediately. How do I join the skype chat discussions?I would like to know if Open Assets are compatible with the latest release by Colu. I created a thread here of most of the services I use the most:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0 How is it different from all of the other exchanges? When the economy is built on debt and false promises, a collapse is the best thing that can happen.Now they can build based on reality. Hopefully with a sound currency.Not holding my breath though.  bitfinex   1,806,866   a few seconds ago   0.255^|  I wonder if this place will get flooded with people this week.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TmPU3ii_uE(before you try to scan the private key in the video, it has a zero balance  ) I have big plans for that extra second.
When you can't get a date because you're a bitch you have to come up with some excuse as to why you don't have a husband and kids yet.This one is as good as any other. Just curious, if I were to fly down to Greece in this environment to capitalize on the market would it be better to bring Euros down to buy bitcoins for cash or would it be better to sell bitcoins for euros? But if he wanted to leave the country and take his wealth he could.  I am surprised that the Euro has only gone down by 1 cent over the weekend vs the dollar. In 2013 the media was just finding out about Bitcoin just as Cyprus happened. So the narrative in some of the news stories was...Cyprus is taking money from peoples' bank accounts. This could not happen with this new thing called Bitcoin.At that point people thought that everyone would start rushing to Bitcoin to keep their money safe. Not as many did as expected. But it helped to get the word out about Bitcoin. I think people are just now wrapping their heads around what's going on. It was around $240 before Greece basically walked out on negotiations. For the first time in a long time I am confident in a rise in the Bitcoin price. For past jumps to $300 I knew it was just manipulation and emotion.Now the bottom has been solidly established and we are heading in the right direction just in time for a currency uncertainty which gives Bitcoin a prime reason for escalation.  They sacrifice some sovereignty for a bail out from the EU because their debt is out of control and they can't pay for it.They can do that. The US debt is out of control and they have no outside entity to sacrifice their sovereignty to for a bailout.Other than the Federal Reserve who will have to print out a whole lot more money. Japan is primed for a collapse.And look who's coming in with the third highest debt to GDP ratio after Greece...  I guarantee it will be the legal tender of a nation some day. So you're saying the "million bitcoins" Satoshi supposedly owns will never be spent?That would send the price to the moon and all trolls that keep bringing it up would have no argument other than hoping and wishing that he is still alive.If Satoshi is dead then luckily he gave Gavin the alert keys so they can still be used in an emergency like when we had to fork in 2013. Is the Venezuela Bolivar money? My argument against it would be that Satoshi still holds those keys as well. I respect Satoshi enough to not take that from him. OP is basically making that argument and wants everyone to upgrade to XT.One one side of the blockchain upgrade proposal are the folks that say we need to follow the BIP process for any Bitcoin upgrade.On the other side, Gavin and Mike Hearn after much discussion have left the decision to the Bitcoin community.If enough people start using the XT wallet then consensus will be reached and the block size will be upgraded. A method the OP appears to prefer. As opposed to the BIP process used previously. Ya, I guess that makes sense...just create a new wallet and if enough people adopt it then consensus is reached and the new code would be in place for Bitcoin.If only they used your approach for getting consensus on a new blocksize. But all past changes to Bitcoin have been through the BIP process, a consensus approach would be different from the past approach to changes.What would we do, create a new wallet without Gavin's Alertkeys and if enough people adopt that new wallet without the keys then eventually it forks and we move forward with the new consensus wallet? Call it what you want. As long as I can get paid in Bitcoin and buy things with it, you trying to put some word to it does not really matter.
So you don't think we should follow the BIP way of adding features to the wallet?Does a consensus approach seem like the best way to make changes to Bitcoin? It was the same with Cyprus. The price jumped when Cyprus froze peoples' bank accounts but it was not people in Cyprus buying bitcoins (it was noted that there was little to no activity with Bitcoin in the country at the time) but it put a spotlight on the fact that a country could possibly freeze bank accounts and that with Bitcoin you can't do that. Greece collapsing just highlights the vulnerabilities of fiat currency which will certainly give Bitcoin a boost.There could certainly be speculation that Greece would adopt Bitcoin which will push the price upwards but it is not a realistic expectation. Ya, because everyone is worried about the blocksize upgrade, even Amazon   Having invested in gold for a while I found that any fast drops would also drop the price of gold in the short term. But over the long term they are opposites. If you look back over the past 6 months I'd call the under $200 dip as the bottom. We came back from that and eventually stabilized in the $220 range. Then an unusually long (for bitcoin) stability in the $230 range. Some stability in the $240 range creates a terrific upward pattern. Now that I am off of credit/debit cards I tend to e-mail a website that I would have used to purchase their services before I move on to find a way to pay with Bitcoin. Some have said that they have received inquiries in the past from others.My contact is usually something along the lines of:"Hello, I have dropped my credit/debit cards and have started using Bitcoin for all of my purchases. I wanted to use your service but notice that you have no option to pay with Bitcoin. Is this something you may be considering or have plans for implementing?"Something simple like that. Takes a few seconds.Let's create a list of links to various merchant's contact links so we can contact them and let them know that there are people out there that would like to pay with bitcoins on their websites.I just sent one to Amazon. You can contact them by logging into your account, click Help, click on any of the Recommended topics on the bottom right. The page will have a "Contact Us" button.Click "Prime or Something Else"Choose one of the drop downs in section "2". Choose your method of contact (e-mail). Send your message.Amazon's response: If we stay over $240 for another week then I would be very satisfied that the bear market is over and that the price should slowly move in the upward direction from here. Interesting, have you dropped your credit cards as well? I have sent similar e-mails to merchants telling them that I am dropping my credit cards and using bitcoins.Maybe I should create a thread so we can coordinate our e-mails to merchants.Edit: Here it ishttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1100748.0 Tuesday is the big day when they need to pay the big IMF payment. If they don't get bailed out they will likely not be able to pay it. I tend to encourage those that come up with some excuse or another not to buy bitcoins to not buy bitcoins.I can see Noah building the ark, initially planning to save his whole town. Then after enough of them made fun of him he's like...fuck it, I'm just putting animals and my family on this thing. Hope you can swim assholes. True, I would only recommend the US version since I got screwed out of 180 euro when I used the SEPA option. My bank called me and claimed that the 180 euro I received was from an account that claimed their account was hacked. Unfortunately I had already sent my bitcoins so there was no way of getting them back. And being in a foreign country there's no way I could work within the system to get it back without a lot of hassle and unwanted meddling into my finances.The US version, someone gets your bank account info, they go to the bank and deposit the money then take a picture of the deposit slip and upload it. Then you wait to see if the funds are in your account and you release the coins. No way to reverse a cash deposit. It's just as good as meeting in person (except the part about involving a bank). If it's just for trading online, bitquick.co is a lot better. They deposit the cash directly into your account. No reversing that transaction. I don't understand how it is an alternative to localbitcoins.I can sell to "Europe"?Ok...so where do I meet this person who is buying in Europe? Fly to Paris? Rome?I've already discovered that SEPA transfers are of no use for selling bitcoins. How is this site supposed to work? I got suckered into going to one of those "cryptocurrency" conferences expecting to hear some good talks about Bitcoin.Nope, it was an alt coin conference. From the topics in your list "digital currency", "blockchain technology", "Bitcoin 2.0" it looks like yet another one.I won't go to any more conferences unless it is a Bitcoin conference. Ya...you're not having kids because you feel guilty about being white...sure.Not because she's ugly. The only way I could see the NSA/CIA doing it is if they had the director of the operation standing over them ensuring that they deleted the private keys for every mined block, and then had multiple people supervise the destruction of the hard drive where the private key existed (every 10 minutes).Two FBI guys were exposed to private keys worth a lot less and they ended up stealing them. Video just calls it out as fear porn, showing that Dr. Steve Sjuggerud made a similar prediction that was supposed to occur in July 2014 that the US dollar would collapse.Here's his old prediction: I definitely would not jump at the opportunity, I made more than that last year when I was in Afghanistan and if I were to transfer over to a CIA/NSA position I would likely have the experience for a GS-12 which pays around $80k in my area and that's after almost 20 years of experience. $150k is the GS-15 pay which is the highest you can receive. A GS-15 would be management level, not the guy writing the code and handling the private keys making squat. Yes. Menu. Dollar just gained in value. The EUR/BTC price did not budge.
"Dr. Steve Sjuggerud" is saying the IMF will announce a new reserve currency on or around October 20th. Just putting that here so that when it does not happen you know to never listen to the guy ever again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BADgVB8OjIWatch the above video to find out who in this thread reads for content and those that only read the title. I did not realize that the IRS was a worldwide organization. I wonder if Kim Jong Un gets pissed every time he has to file his US income taxes. In all reality, CIA/NSA people don't get paid shit. So if he did work for those agencies you can damn well believe that he would have cashed out those early bitcoins years ago.It is more likely that he worked in the private sector and has previously created something that gave him enough money to enjoy a comfortable life where money is not that big of a deal.If it was a CIA/NSA project then that would mean multiple people would have access to those private keys. A simple act of writing down the key and sticking it in your shoe would allow you to retire from your shitty paying CIA/NSA job. I think I found your problem... Doesn't have to happen this year.Before the first halving the price was low even a month or two after the halving. Then the fun began.This time it may happen sooner because people are looking at the trend for the last time and might buy earlier in anticipation. If it holds in the 240 range for another 2 weeks or so we can officially declare the bear market dead. After that I ask her if she wants to come back to my place and see my private key.  I wonder how many bots include amount of blockchain transactions into their trading formulas. I pick up girls by saying:"Hi there, my public key is 19KJZ5aqWnrrCaNAS5Pbd4uknPFBxjALRt"Better than driving a Ferrari.Yes, I say it out loud...their knees start to buckle as I get to PFBx. Snowden was not a CIA agent.He was a contractor working on a CIA project. Here in Germany they go after BitTorrent by prosecuting the seeders. They get the IP address of the seeder then go to the ISP to find out the owner of that IP address (linked to an address). They then send a letter in the mail to the owner of that Internet contract telling them that they will be fined for illegally sharing copyrighted content. My former landlord received one such letter because "one" of his tenants, who shall remain nameless, was seeding. The fine was somewhere around 900 euros each for 2 different movies. Fighting it involves getting a lawyer and trying to get the fine down.When I was home visiting my mother she received a nastygram e-mail and phone call from Comcast because "one" of her sons, who shall remain nameless, just happened to have BitTorrent running with some seeded files. Of course, in the US there is no enforcement behind such notices so I told her to ignore it. I would not be surprised by a dip later in the day when Greece is given more money to save them from default.Or in a couple of days as they "iron out the details". Bitcoin, if it were to gain mainstream adoption, would be the end of the NSA/CIA/governments/wars/etc. I find it interesting but...why would someone pay for that content if they can get that same thing free from the same person?Does the client have some way of only allowing Bitcoin spenders to access that seeded content?I am sure this has been addressed since it is such an obvious aspect of torrenting, but I am curious how it works. I filled it with about $250 but the rate was 5% to charge it a few months ago. It took about 4 days to get filled. I don't see it as a solution. I pay for everything with cash so I haven't tried to use it yet. So it looks like we have a solid window between $240 and $250 for a while. 6 months If you ever use Amazon, converting to Bitcoin can give you an immediate 20+% profit on what you would have spent with fiat. During Cyprus it was a perfect storm. The block reward had just halved, the US FinCen released their guidance on how the US was going to treat Bitcoin and a few rich people were starting to find out about it (Winklevoss twins, Andreeson, a few others). Cyprus helped to highlight Bitcoin's utility during that time.Hardly anybody (see almost nobody) in Cyprus actually used Bitcoin at that point. As far as any thoughts of Greece abandoning the euro and adopting Bitcoin.1. Greece will not default, they'll get bailed out. Any hyped news is just posturing by one side or the other for leverage.2. Hardly anyone in Greece knows about Bitcoin. They are not a technologically advanced country where Bitcoin would be able to be of much use. Try telling the old Greek voter that they now have to use digital money backed by cryptography.
Gun control in many countries may also be why the women are more oppressed than in the US.Guns are the great equalizer. I know I don't even have to waste my breath on pointing out Trump's flaws. He will reveal himself easily enough. Imagine if all of the jews had guns. How many of them would have been swept away to the gas chambers by the thousands?The point of having guns is that the people should have more power than their government. Sadly that shift of power has long been in the hands of the US government over the past 130 years or so. The whole point of the right to bare arms was lost during the Civil War. That's actually a great idea on how Greece could get out of this.Stage a fake "regime change" with fake violence and everything. The leaders feign shock and disgrace and step down (retire to a luxury villa) and the new "regime" makes some superficial changes claiming that they are not responsible for the old regime's debts.Problem solved. Collectivism is something to be used to manipulate those that are less intelligent than you.When someone starts talking about some collective, it is likely that they are trying to take power from you. Gun control?You should use 2 hands. Ahh ok, good to know. Thanks.  People who actually have bitcoins don't really care about the upgrade options. It is being over-hyped by people that don't hold bitcoins and the usual alt coin trolls.We have seen many times in the past that the bitcoin code can be forked when necessary without any impact on 99.9% of bitcoin users.McDonalds stock doesn't swing based on an upgrade in the spices used in the McRib. No need to sign your comment. Your name is shown on the left side there. Truth Committee...sounds so official.What enforcement power do they have? Just an FYI for takeaway.com which points to lieferservice.de in Germany. lieferservice.de has stopped accepting bitcoins but said they plan on bringing it back.They merged with another company that didn't accept them and used the new company's payment processor. Ok, good to know.I was just looking at these parts:6.3. System withdraws the commission from the Users wallet.6.7. Mining pool maintenance fee is collected automatically only from the Users who have no less than one valid (not empty) wallet in GHS.6.8. Mining pool maintenance fee is withdrawn from the Users BTC wallet on the daily basis at the moment of mining earning accruals.

Just sign up on BitWage and your employer won't even know. If you can split your direct deposit between two bank accounts you can set the percentage yourself. Yep, that's how it works. Bitwage gave me a direct deposit number to give my company. My company deposits to that account and BitWage immediately converts it to bitcoins and sends it to my public key. I'm interested but this part of the Terms of Use are concerning:So do I have to pay a commission to have bitcoins in my wallet? I solved the Amazon Fire stick thing using bitcoins.Went to ebay and found a fire stick and the guy shipped worldwide. I ordered it for $43.97. I went to gyft.com and bought a $45 ebay gift card (found out later I could have saved $1 using egifter.com which lets you order down to the dollar). I put the gift code in and the purchase amount changed to $0. I still had to log in with my PayPal account to "pay" zero dollars.The fire stick showed up yesterday.I don't really want a PayPal account though. I just got charged over $100 for my Rosetta Stone subscription through PayPal. I thought it had ended.I get a few e-mails here and there from companies telling me that my credit card on file needs to be updated. A small charge here and there from some service I signed up for would pop up at times and I'd just live with it because it's always such a hassle to cancel a service. Now I can just let them send me e-mails.
I wonder if Mr. Combs will write one of his musical ballads to include Bitcoin instead of Benjamins. Magnr provides interest on bitcoin deposits. Xapo allows you to store your bitcoins in their vault. Web wallets allow you to store your bitcoins on their sites. Exchanges allow you to withdraw fiat. Some exchanges provide debit cards.BUT if a service is called a "bank" everyone's all "BITCOIN DOESN'T NEED A BANK!"I suspect half of the repeated comments on this thread (that haven't read any of the other comments) are signature campaigners getting their post numbers up.  Both are rectangles. If we can stay above $240 for a few weeks then we can officially put the bear market to rest and prepare for the long road upwards. Dude had a dream to grow a pony tail and he just DID IT LTC has usually followed the Bitcoin price.During the jump to $1200/BTC it got up to around $40/LTC. Crashed in the same way.I believe it is generally believed that if Bitcoin becomes a major currency, then Litecoin will be one as well. Just less so. I think a great thing for the Bitcoin community would be to have an annual contest where the highest concentration of Bitcoin tourism businesses in a 1-2 mile radius is rewarded (somehow).Something where someone can go to that town, have a nice weekend as a tourist spending only bitcoins.So it would need at least one hotel that accepts bitcoins. Transportation (if necessary, at least from the airport). At least 4 sources of food (2 restaurants that could be visited for dinner). Some activities (tour/excursion/etc) that can be done during the day. At least one night time activity (bar, club, etc). And one place to buy souvenirs.Maybe the reward could consist of publicity, money for advertisements, a year long designation as the "Bitcoin city", whichever... Or someone's bot broke. I'm not a big fan of such a huge rally based on nothing.While I believe the price should be closer to $400 I am skeptical of a 10+% rise out of nowhere.If it is based on the Grexit thing (as Reuters claims) then that just leaves the price to go back down when they bail out Greece in the next week or so.Regardless, I hope it stabilizes above $240 for a while putting a final nail in the bear market. It's mostly the racists that can't personally do anything directly to harm minorities that love taxes the most, leaving it in the governments' hands. They look at their paycheck and think "well at least my taxes are going toward putting some black person in prison on drug charges" or "I hope this gets some muslim killed in some far off country" or "If this was the 1940s the amount taken out of this paycheck could have easily killed 2 or 3 jews"  In the end people just love taxes. That's all there is to it.Without taxes, how would Hitler be able to fund his armies and gas chambers?I think everyone goes back to that thought when they think of taxes and are grateful that he was able to get the funding necessary.How would we be able to pay for drones to kill our own citizens? Would Bush have been able to bomb Fallujah with white phosphorous melting the skin of any women and chlidren within a few hundred feet?How else would our governments have had the money to fund ISIS?I think everyone looks at their paycheck and sees the portion of the tax money taken out of their paycheck and thinks "I hope that went to fund a terrorist this week."And what about the roads??? Right? Tanks and troop carriers can roll down roads a lot easier than some unpaved span of dirt.We can all agree on that right? This move is impressive. I don't see indicators that it will fall back down again. We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy but because it is hard. Free trade does not require a law to be passed. It looks like the movie they set this up for is about Bitcoin:http://www.thewrap.com/dope-to-become-first-movie-to-accept-bitcoin-for-ticket-purchases-exclusive/ And if they don't have your movie theater.https://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-cards/fandango/ Bitmit was a bitcoin based ebay and it had a lot of users. There is definitely a need. Others pop up here and there but without everyone rallying around one service it does not have the seller and customer base needed to take off. Welcome to the price of 30 days ago.Next stop:6 months ago Xapo anyone? They charge a fee to hold your bitcoins in a vault.Exchanges? They provide bank like services to get your fiat.Why is this seen as such a negative? We already have plenty of third party services that do many different things. Just because this third party service has the word "bank" in it does not mean that all of the sudden Bitcoin is not somehow controlled by bankers.What I can see a bank doing is providing things like direct deposit to your bank account with any currency being converted directly to bitcoins.I see debit cards that you can spend anywhere and it automatically converts it to the currency you need from your bitcoin balance.Other than that it will be like having your coins on any other web wallet.
Greece capital controls will not affect Bitcoin. Greece leaving the eurozone will wreak havok on the markets and more likely send more people to Bitcoin. So we don't like bitcoin banks but we're ok with bitcoin exchanges...Not much difference. F#@k that little mouse 'cuz I'm an arbitrage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bznxx12Ptl0 Ok, I think if I read over the white paper on that about 20 more times I might finally understand.I think the key for me is that it is using OP_RETURN to store the hash on the blockchain (if I'm reading it right), which means that it is not using some third party or a separate blockchain which was my main concern.I also found this site: http://coinsecrets.org/ which dislays all of the OP_RETURN data being inserted to the blockchain.It shows one transaction: https://blockchain.info/tx/9805d9729e86168c55575dd1cbcdd65737123eff924f3d409c24d8b77b408793?show_adv=truewith the OP_RETURN of " jWOW, WHAT AN ASSHOLE"wonder what that's all about...lol If it is established that the 1 share represents more than just the .001 bitcoin then that value and scarcity would give it added value.This 5 cent nickel was purchased for over $3 million. Ok, I've looked into the various different colored coin options out there and it seems strange that there should need to be wallets and protocols built around it.Couldn't I just declare an address as the source and any addresses transferred to from there are then colored?For example:I start a new company and want to use colored coins for stocks.In the company bi-laws, announcements, website, basically every official location for the company so that it is publicly available, we announce the starting Bitcoin address of:1NewStartupJsJFbfs2n243Jshayywem342Bart69and fill it with 100 bitcoinsThen we specify that every .0001 bitcoins is worth 1 share of the company.When someone buys 1 share then from the 100 bitcoins .0001 bitcoins is sent to a public key that they specify. They now own that share. They can now sell it if they want or just keep the private key and hodl.Since the blockchain keeps track of every transaction you could just have a website tracking that first 100 bitcoin address and any transactions from there. Any future share actions can easily pull up all of the addresses and their share amounts.Dividend payment would be easy because you just send it to each public key based on the balance amount. Someone might want to buy 1000 shares so they have .1 bitcoin from the source address. That address would receive 1000 shares worth of dividends.Am I missing something on why there would need to be a protocol built to do that? (I suppose I should just read the various different protocols to see what value they actually add).  Some smart person here needs to figure out how this can work for sending Bitcoins from a credit card.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX9cbxLSOkE The 20mb block size thing is just about coming to a decision on a Bitcoin upgrade.Bitcoin will still work the same whether there is an upgrade or not. A slow gradual climb is more healthy anyway. People can theorize that ISIS is willing to use Bitcoins for all of their terrorism in middle of the desert where 1800s technology is about as good as it gets. But Greece...with their Internet and electricity...no way. Too advanced. It is like offering someone a job in your porn video for free with the promise that "we will give you some great exposure....porn stars can make over $100k per year with some of the big companies"Actually that's the pickup line I usually use. There were a lot fewer trolls. We had a handful of bears that were not as optimistic that the price would go to the moon but they were here because they understood and believed in the technology.Occasionally we would get a Keynesian that took offense to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin.But it was typically a place where you could come with questions and get constructive answers because everyone wanted Bitcoin to succeed.Now half of the threads I visit are filled with ignored users. What kind of monkey is your mum looking to adopt?  lol EUR/USD is $1.11Yesterday it was $1.12more interesting volatility? Old Fiat car crashes in Bitcoin broker's office in Montevideo, Uruguay Imagine back in the day RedHat getting funding for Linux or Netscape getting funding for http.OpenBazaar did not get the funding but a company that will be using the OpenBazaar protocol. Made up mainly of the developers of the protocol, so they will be able to best tailor the protocol to their business requirements. If the media can spin a tweet about Bitcoin to ISIS as saying that ISIS is funding their recruitment and operations with Bitcoin then Russia making Bitcoin legal should be spun to imply that Russia is now running their full military and government on Bitcoin.Bitcoin is the new official currency of Russia!
Chart Buddy is broke, someone kick it. Like the over 400 million dollars they gained when they took over the Mosul central bank. So the media thinks.Except the part about ISIS being full of ignorant desert people that don't even know how to operate an American toilet. Much less scan a QR code. It would have been worse if he had aided and abetted them by providing them with weapons and money.What charges should be brought against those that do that? Except they haven't. The whole article is based on some 17 year old's tweet. At least we know our taxpayer money is going toward quality posts. Just another example of why you should not express your beliefs in public if you live in the United States.The Patriot Act might be gone but it was replaced by the Freedom Act which is worse.Treat your thoughts like your private keys and keep it in cold storage. Welcome to Bitcoin! They used this tweet as proof that ISIS is using bitcoins for recruitment and paying for their terrorist operations.The war propaganda machine is alive and well. preach on brother! Just about everything.See this link for a link of most of the sites I use:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0 I am starving. They need to start accepting Bitcoin again. Just like the douche who regulated Bitcoin in New York then quit to open a Bitcoin consulting business. There is work to put Bitcoin on satellites. Oh shit...a government profiting from Bitcoin.Russia's about to become the new superpower. I think everyone will just voluntarily give bitcoins to the government because of the love we all have for taxes and our great leaders.Without taxes we would have no roads.As Ben Franklin said during his emancipation proclamation speech: "Without taxes we will all be confined to our homes with no way to get anywhere, that is why we must have the 16th Amendment as part of our Constitution."And he was right.Most people love paying taxes, I'm not sure what you're talking about OP. You sound un-American and should have your door kicked in by our hero cops to drag you to tax prison. Earth is #1!!!!Woo!!!Earth! Earth! Earth! The next 24 hours are critical! Still am. I legally avoid income taxes by living outside the US. As for taxes on my bitcoins....ya, sure I'm keeping track of all of that because I love the IRS and think the US deserves as much of my money as they can get. I follow all US regulations and tax laws to the letter(to the agents that might read this thread). Accept they aren't. The article is fake.
Again, the article has no facts to back up its claims.I'm not one to say their aught to be a law but....isn't stating a falsehood and getting paid (advertising money from clicks) considered fraud? There is a US site:http://www.takeaway.comWhen I go to that site it allows me to choose the German site.Edit: My bad, I thought it was a US site. It's a UK site that redirects me. It says in their e-mail:"Since the companies lieferando and lieferservice became one, we just used the pay options from lieferando." I use http://www.takeaway.com for ordering food sometimes, lately once every Saturday when hanging out with friends.Being in Germany they redirect me to a local service (lieferservice). On Saturday I went to order something but found no bitcoin payment option to pay.I checked again today and saw that it was not available for other restaurants so I sent the site an e-mail to ask about it and this was their response:Glad to see that Germans are using it and willing to e-mail the company when the option is not available. If you use their "Vault" service which keeps your private keys in a very secure vault then you have to pay something like 1-2% per year. It's what Overstock CEO did. I have it on good authority that someone's team is pushing the bitcoin price this week. Wink It's 3% when you buy with bitcoins. Some of them also partner with companies and various other services.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=238637.0 His question was:"How are wallets (e.g. Xapo) actually earning money?" Could the answer be that Gavin keeps posing questions on what is the best solution?And then it is interpreted by everybody and their cousin that Gavin has proclaimed something. Xapo has a long term storage service that they charge their customers for. Added review of Gyft and added egifter. "Consider the fact that consumers are always paid in U.S. dollars"False"retailers are not providing visible bitcoin price discounts in U.S. dollar terms"False You would rather pay 1% to convert to fiat to pay directly on Amazon or Ebay as opposed to keeping it in bitcoins and saving up to 50% on Amazon or 3% on eBay by keeping it in bitcoin? What's going on!""?!I go to sleep and the price is $223 and wake up to $224!!??!!I will never go to sleep again, this is so exciting!!!?! The article has no facts which would demonstrate that ISIS is using Bitcoin.From the article:"It seems ISIS stumbled upon the most ideal form of currency handling platform  Bitcoin."link to -> http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36961/intelligence/isis-in-the-deepweb.html"Hidden services in the Deep Web also offer the possibility to download the mobile apps used by the jihadists to communicate securely and to transfer Bitcoins to terrorist cells in every place of the world."link to -> http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33598/cyber-crime/isis-already-using-bitcoin.htmlThe closest they come to having any evidence of "ISIS Moving Money Using Bitcoin Aiding Recruitment, Training..." is a forum post on one of their websites:"In a post called Bitcoin and the Charity of Violent Physical Struggle, the author argues such donations would be untrackable by Western governments."So there are at least 5 stories (now another here on bitcointalk...thanks OP) declaring that ISIS is using Bitcoin (because it is the best way to transfer money around the world) based on a single forum post by some guy that likes Bitcoin within ISIS.I work for the US Military. I post all the time about the benefits of Bitcoin on web forums. Why are there no stories about how the US military is using Bitcoin to aid in recruitment, training, etc? https://steambitshop.com/https://steamloader.comAs for Walmart, Gyft and Egifter stopped selling Walmart cards.I did find this though, I'm not sure how it works:https://www.cardflip.com/product-category/walmart/ Yes, through Braintree they indicated they would start accepting Bitcoin payments.http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/04/15/ebay-and-paypal-to-accept-bitcoin-payments-through-braintree/But what's the big deal of the extra step? Do people want ebay to accept bitcoins directly for some sort of publicity or just because the price?This is a major step toward the chicken and egg problem of "why would I get bitcoins if there's nobody who accepts them vs why would I accept them if nobody uses them".Getting 3% back by paying with bitcoins through gyft makes using bitcoins better than paying with dollars. What advantage would ebay accepting it give other than 2 less clicks? So I saw this:http://www.ebay.com/itm/100-eBay-Gift-Card-for-only-95-Email-delivery/261913083466?_trksid=p2045573.c100033.m2042&_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D31478%26meid%3Dd7effac689bf45b4b5782321f73c2cea%26pid%3D100033%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D4%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D261913083466It's a $100 ebay gift card for $95 that is emailed to you. So could you not theoretically go on egifter and buy a $95 ebay gift card and buy the ebay $100 gift card, enter your PayPal info and get your $100 ebay gift code in your e-mail...which you can then use to buy a $100 for $95 which you then use to buy a $100 gift card for $95 and on and on and on....?I tried it but PayPal asked me to verify my account with a text message to my phone and I don't have a US cell phone anymore. I use Skype and don't get text messages.
I knew about Gyft accepting bitcoin. I just had not seen ebay on there. Ebay has so many items that it would be difficult to find anything you wanted to purchase that you could not buy through ebay. You can even buy boats, cars...a house.I said 90% of the things I want to buy online because Amazon and ebay cover pretty much 90% of whatever retail goods you might want to buy online. The rest need to just start accepting Bitcoin so it's 100%.Oh and as far as having money left over on your gift card...using http://www.egifter.com you can buy a card in $1 increments. My purchase was $43.97 so my gyft card has $1.03 remaining on it but had I used egifter I would only be off by 3 cents. As long as I can use Bitcoin to buy things on their sites, it's no big deal whether they accept it or not. Nobody will buy bitcoins just so they can buy items on those sites. And you can get a discount already using third party sites so there's not much benefit for the buyer other than one or two less clicks. Looks like you can use egifter too. They look good because you can buy the exact dollar amount while gyft was giving me the price in $5 increments and over $50 it was $25 increments.https://www.egifter.com/giftcards/ebay-gift-card No TA on my part other than looking at those first 2 charts of the last large jumps and drawing what it would look like if it happened again.However if you go by my chart it will be another 2 years or so before we jump again. So be prepared for a long stretch of low prices. I just made an ebay purchase using bitcoins via gyft.https://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-cards/ebay/So now that I can buy anything on Amazon through purse.io and ebay through gyft.com that covers about 90% of the goods I could ever want to buy online. Both at a discount.  Several, until we are a world currency. You are scared because you don't understand something?Do you know an easy way to get rid of that fear?Don't only rely on other people to look into things for you, the best way to find the truth is on your own. This.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R8HG40yv20    Ya, the premine thing would be the main reason to go that route but it would require faith in people wanting to invest in it.I am mainly thinking about the mining portion, if a hurricane hits or Internet to the island is shut off for a short period if the majority of the mining is done locally then they can continue the chain with most of the transactions. However it is more vulnerable to a 51% attack if it stays small and localized.Like someone said, the infrastructure for Bitcoin already exists...focusing on the island structure should be the highest priority. You don't need to convert your bitcoins to real money. Bitcoin is real money and can be used to pay for things.Here is a thread showing where you can spend your bitcoins on day to day things (usually at a discount, and always easier than other payment methods).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0Don't be so quick to get rid of something that people are literally willing to spend more than their value to obtain because it is too difficult for them to do so. Hmm, I had not thought from this perspective. I guess I was focusing on the tourists. That does make sense. If they fall for it again you lose all respect?You give the American voter much more credit than I could ever muster. I was thinking Bitcoin would be good because the tourists can more easily find exchanges for their local currency to bitcoins while an Alt would likely require conversion to Bitcoin and then the Alt. Plus, as the Bitcoin price goes up globally, the small community would gain automatic wealth.But an Alt could fund much of their project by pre-mining. Ok, let's take a hypothetical island in the Bahamas with full Internet access via the US and the Bahamas mainland.Let's say that a group of investors wanted to build a small "libertarian" (still abiding by Bahamas laws) community on that island for tourism and living.If they wanted to use a cryptocurrency for their local economy, would it be better to just use Bitcoin or create their own alternative cryptocurrency?If an alternative, what structure would be best for keeping most of the mining income local? Rand Paul received 7% Here's a thread with links and reviews of every day sites you can use:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0 Then how would University professors get paid? Fox News at it again In 2140 I will celebrate the last block with a concoction of nano-healers and tell my great great great great grandchildren about how I was around in the days when you could get 50 bitcoins just for running a program on what we referred to at the time as "computers".
I am selling pre-fork coins for the new fork for only 10 old bitcoins for each shiny new fork bitcoin.I will even send you a new public AND private key for the new blockchain.Limited quantity, while supplies last. We could take the phased in approach of switching to XT which has the code to phase it in over time.which...when Gavin asked if that was a good idea he was labeled a heretic and every thread on bitcointalk suggested he was destroying Bitcoin I understand why you would want a Bitcoin business. I do not understand why anyone would choose to run their business in the United States. They are one of the top 5 least business friendly countries in the world. Ya, I could just have it sent to my mom's house but I'm trying to figure out something that will work repeatedly. I could order it on Amazon UK (and have it shipped to my German address) but the price is 1.5 times the US price. Which I can cut back down to regular price through purse.io. I guess you can buy iTunes codes with Bitcoinhttps://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-cards/itunes-code/Looks like I didn't search enough for Google Playhttp://www.yottaelectronics.com/products/google-play-gift-card Before it went down price was $235. Then when it came back up: I did not think of that. So without merged mining there would be 5 months of 1 hour, 40 minute blocks.I doubt that chain would succeed. And most likely other miners would bail to the point that it could be years of multiple hour blocks. This. Every time I have seen bitcointalk go down the price goes up. No idea why, maybe the signature campaign people are not cashing out their money. Updated my takeaway.com review after using it a second time.Has anyone else used this service and had something you put in the "remarks" box ignored? It might be a German thing or just based on each restaurant's system. If only 10% of miners are mining on "Blockchain B" then they will still have the same difficulty resulting in each block being found on average every 100 minutes for about 2 weeks.Who will still be using a blockchain where the block discovery slows by 10X? So the latest thing I ran into was that I wanted an app for my phone via Google Play. I could not find any way to pay with Bitcoin. I realized I still have money in my PayPal account so I used that.I usually like to e-mail companies when I run into something I want to buy that I can't pay for. After searching for the person that would be in charge of such matters I found Ariel Bardin was the one to contact. I shot off an e-mail to ariel.bardin@gmail.com to see if that's the right guy.One ship to APO company replied to my e-mail and said they were "keeping an eye" on Bitcoin for now. I just don't understand what they would be waiting for. Like something big will change where they need to jump on board. I'm still trying to figure out how to get an Amazon fire stick shipped to me. I don't see much reason to have a Bitcoin business in the US unless you are a business that goes back and forth between Bitcoin and fiat. My job will just change to programming the machines to do peoples' jobs. Yep, I am using his list for a while, quite handy. Just seems like quite the uptick in trolls since the hack. So instead of a bunch of 0 post trolls there are 60, 100, etc...The ignore list keeps growing and growing.Edit: as for price, I really don't care...I get paid Friday so I like the low price but I know it'll be back up by then anyway so no big deal A Bitcoin bank could provide currency conversion services so you can have a debit card, direct deposit, write checks, etc.You write a check for dollars, it gets cashed and bitcoins in your account are converted to whatever currency the check was made for. Same for debit cards, etc. coincidence?If only there was a Bitcoin Forum where only bitcoin users were allowed to post. Looks like the more centralized/scammish a coin gets, the faster the transactions.  I just bought 2 pizzas tonight with bitcoins so...rumors of Bitcoin's death are highly exageratted I'll just start posting the truth on all of these FUD threads.Here is Gavin's question on a discussion board:
I'll just start posting the truth on all of these FUD threads.Here is Gavin's question on a discussion board: I'll just start posting the truth on all of these FUD threads.Here is Gavin's question on a discussion board: I'll just start posting the truth on all of these FUD threads.Here is Gavin's question on a discussion board: I'll just start posting the truth on all of these FUD threads.Here is Gavin's question on a discussion board: I'll just start posting the truth on all of these FUD threads.Here is Gavin's question on a discussion board: I'll just start posting the truth on all of these FUD threads.Here is Gavin's question on a discussion board: Some people are even taking a discussion board post starting with "what do you guys think of this?" as some major announcement. I'll just start posting the truth on all of these FUD threads.Here is Gavin's question on a discussion board: List of countries where they jail non-violent Bitcoin users:-United States And nobody actually read his post.This is the biggest amount of FUD I have seen in a long time.Please point to the place where "Gavin Threatens to Quit Bitcoin Development and Join Hearn's Fork" His only consolation is that the US government will not last as long as his sentence. Or we could stay in a small range for the next year.   Some pictures were released: BitPools has a voting system set up which uses the blockchain. Electric water heater. You can milk a pig. Anything with nipples can be milked. You can have people voting on every single proposal that affects them. With their bitcoins. that's what she said About 98% of my wealth is in bitcoins. Other than home equity and retirement.If bitcoin went to $0 tomorrow I could still pay my rent, I could still afford food and gas. I live far below my income but am still able to travel and do other things I enjoy.But with the reward halving coming next year, I am fine with holding as many bitcoins as I can get at these low prices. My strategy is that if Bitcoin falls significantly, in 2 weeks I get paid again. And I will continue to get paid.
For online payments it is so much easier to pay with bitcoins.Though I do not get the chance to pay with bitcoins very often in the real world, paying with bitcoins is so easy. Take out your phone (which everyone carries now), open Coinbase...scan the QR code, hit send. Done. I don't give my phone to someone to take somewhere, I don't have to worry about what cards I have in my wallet when I leave the house, if someone robs me and steals everything (including my phone) I am not out any money or hassle with credit card companies and replacements. My phone is locked and encrypted so good luck getting to my Coinbase wallet before I change my password.Just took a trip to Lyon, France over the weekend. What I could not pay for with bitcoins I paid with cash (obtained from selling on localbitcoins). The only difference was when checking out of the hotel they asked for my credit card to charge the room. I assured the girl that I already paid. She told me a lot of people think they paid but only reserved the room with my credit card. I told her I paid with bitcoins and have no credit card so it was definitely paid. She pulled up my paperwork and sure enough, it showed the room was paid upfront via Expedia.  One of the videos they did, not sure if it's all going to be in the movie but it's pretty positive:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Pp7bJcn74As one Bitcoin documentary movie maker said, you can't just have a completely pro Bitcoin movie. His formula was to start out positive, have some controversy and then end it back on a positive note. Looks like they might be trying to do the same thing. I've been following them for a while, they were able to buy groceries at a local grocery store and I think they convinced a farm co-op to accept bitcoins. They were actually able to get quite a few local businesses to accept bitcoin so they weren't so bad off.One of the big ones I remember was their Internet and phone service. They were online paying people in bitcoins for minutes to add to their plan. Then they found a better alternative. And gas was tricky at first, they had to drive a long distance to one location that would take it.The kickstarter ended a few years ago. They used the money only for the camera crew and producing the movie, not for living expenses. Switching back and forth?Nope, converting to bitcoins and spending bitcoins. I sometimes need fiat so I sell bitcoins for a profit using localbitcoins.My next challenge is that sometimes I order electronics on Amazon through Purse.io and they don't ship to an APO address. So I have been using a ship to APO website (apobox.com) that charges my credit card so I can use a US address that they then box and ship to my APO address.I will put in a request at the various sites to see if they can add bitcoin as a payment option.  Just came out. Looks like it could be good:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmGDcDmu6ak Tell your friend to post a video with the sign. And post the picture from different angles and different sources.Anyone can photoshop a Bitcoin QR code. Imagine a major company actually keeping this currency: The price fluctuations are not that bad. If you are living paycheck to paycheck you may want to re-think your spending habits. If you are able to wait between the time you are paid until either A: the price goes up or B: you get paid again, then you will always be spending at or above the amount of money you earned on pay day. Do this long enough and you will eventually double one of your paychecks.For me it is ideal because I am paid in dollars but live in Europe. Selling bitcoins via localbitcoins I actually make a 10% profit on every euro that I convert. By doing this I am basically getting at least a 10% raise plus the amount of extra value I get by only spending when the price is higher or equal to the amount of my paycheck (the price does go up between paychecks at times as well).And if all you do is get paid in bitcoin and don't try to time it by spending when the price is high you are essentially dollar cost averaging, so over time your pay averages out. Through brawker.com this was already possible. Unfortunately they are no longer around but it does create a vacuum that needs to be filled.I could see this being done using OpenBazaar and maybe a browser plugin. And yet people continue to give these people power through their tax dollars.Giving someone power then getting upset with them for abusing it is not the path forward. The first step is to figure out how to stop giving them power. One of the European card swiping machines (Indego?) had the software capability added that allows for paying with Bitcoin. Apparently the retailer just has to add that functionality (like downloading an app).I can easily see a future where card swiping technology just includes Bitcoin payment software as a default. The retailer might not even know or care, it'll just be another payment method on his machine. Anything from the book is probably less information than you could get from reading bitcointalk for about an hour.Here is an article by the book's author last year:http://tech.mit.edu/V134/N5/wire1.htmlLooks like he just regurgitates the obvious. It is most likely geared toward the non Bitcoin user. Never knew of the ability to give your private key on MtGox. Seems like a ridiculous method of deposit unless they immediately moved the coins to an address that they fully controlled. And only verified the funds once those coins had moved.You do not own coins unless you (and only you) have the private key. If your employer pays you via direct deposit you can use Bitwage to get paid in bitcoins.I have been getting paid in bitcoins since the beginning of 2015 via Bitwage. As for price fluctuations, I get paid every 2 weeks which is good for dollar cost averaging. On top of that, usually if the price goes down after I get paid I hold off on any spending I can hold off on for those 2 weeks. If the price jumps up quickly I buy those things I've been putting off. Congrats on your investment into some alt.Good luck reaching the network effect somewhere so you can become rich. Don't invest more than you can afford to looose. price up 25 cents todayDa moon!!!?! I have an Esso card through the military instead of needing to go on base to fill up.As for ATMs, I think there are only 2 in Germany and they are only for buying bitcoins. Last week on Facebook: Ok, a few people asked for me to update with any difficulties I run into with this.I usually do not buy bitcoins through localbitcoins but I stuck an ad on there anyway a long time ago at a percentage that I did not think anyone would ever take, and since Germany blocked localbitcoins I cannot edit my ad so everyone in Germany is locked into how we were in December. (I probably shouldn't be saying on a public forum that people can still get to those ads...so shhh).Anyway, I get a message from someone who really needed some money. He arrived in Germany to work and the ATM ate his card. He tried to get his wife to Western Union him some money but he had a hard time finding one and the fees were more than my ridiculous exchange rate (20% discount). So he contacted me and I really could not pass up such a rate so I gave him all the cash I had available. I had deposited a lot the week before so I only had a few hundred euro available. I had a few sales so I had some spending money again but he contacted me again a week later. He was moving into an apartment and needed some money. I again gave him everything I had, only a few hundred euro. Long story short, I was starting to run out of food and money for spending. Usually I have cash around so it's no big deal. I finally had to go into my big pile of coins that I've been amassing since I arrived in Europe. Fortunately they have a 2 euro coin and I just throw those to the side like they're quarters. I was fine but that was the first time I felt the pinch of not being able to access my money and taught me that I need to keep some reserves around just in case. Fortunately rent is not due until the end of the month and I have enough people buying bitcoins that I am caught up now but that gave me a flashback to the college days of scraping up change for food.The problem I see now is getting dollars. I work for the military so I can use the Commissary to buy cheap American food but they only take dollars. I also fill up my gas card with dollars which gives me US prices at the pump. I did fill that up with $200 last month and I drive a Smart car so I should be good for about half a year. I was thinking maybe I could buy popular gadgets for 35% off on Amazon through purse.io and sell it to people on post for dollars through the local craigslist. And I think it is better that I not eat American food anyway, it's probably healthier to spend the extra few euros for German food. I just need to get used to less preservatives means cooking things quicker.I am looking to go on a vacation in France next week so we'll see how that goes.   Interesting, I bought a car in Germany last fall. I had no cash and to transfer that much over would have taken days. I could take money from my US bank account at the ATM at a heavy conversion and ATM fee which had a limit of 4-500 euro per day so it would have taken me 10 days of doing that to get the cash. Instead I went on localbitcoins and got 5000 euros for my 12 bitcoins (price was higher at the time) and paid the private seller in cash. It is probably different for me since I go through the military for registration. That was a hassle of its own.What part of Germany are you in?
funny, you proved my point We should have nanosecond confirmations.I want my block confirmed before the transaction. That can only be done if we move to nanoseconds.Whoever suggests anything else just doesn't want Bitcoin to evolve. That's probably why Satoshi left. I was thinking of this. I saw a cop talking about skimmers where someone can get your card info and then program a card with another device to have all of that information.What if such a programming device was small enough to fit in your pocket and bluetooth enabled. When you want to pay for something you send bitcoins to a site that charges a card with that exact amount and then sends that card's data directly to your card device. You pull it out and pay for whatever. Then you put the card back in and it zeros out the card info.Bonus if the device was card sized and fit into slots. First thing I thought when I saw that was...why is the only useful thing to do with Dog coins is to give them away.They're so worthless that the most join you get from them is by getting them out of your wallet as fast as possible. Ok I see colored coins and counterparty working toward this.Are there any others? I am working on a startup with a team right now and would like to propose to the others a viable solution that uses the Bitcoin blockchain.About 100,000 shares, $100 each. https://youtu.be/4hjLgXA-MZY?t=23mIn this video Peter Thiel is talking about technology and why the Internet has been largely unregulated and he mentions"My experience at PayPal where we created this new financial service which attracted a great deal of regulatory scrutiny, it happened so quickly that the regulators were too slow to respond. We went public in February 2002, there were some people in the state of Louisiana who wanted to shut us down because maybe we're doing illegal banking. We called up the bank regulators in Louisiana and said there are 100,000 people with PayPal accounts in the state of Louisiana 3,000 small businesses, does Louisiana really want to get the reputation as a state that's technologically backwards and hostile to progress. And the answer was "No we don't" and so we were able to keep going..."   "I think there is a velocity of it that is very critical..."We need more people using Bitcoin regularly so we can stay ahead of the regulatory wave. If New York had 1 million people using bitcoins in their daily lives do you really think they would have any support when it comes to regulating it and possibly disrupting those million people's daily routines? They would be worried about the backlash. But by only disrupting a few people and businesses early on they have all of the advantage to do whatever they want with no major backlash.Start using http://www.bitwage.co, get part of your paycheck converted to Bitcoin (even if it's just 5%). Start using it for most of your online purchases. Use it when you order pizza or takeaway. Use it at Starbucks. Even if it's just a few bucks a week. Become a Bitcoin user. Not just a hodler. First is whether or not they accept a US citizen on a foreign exchange. I found only one in Europe that allowed me to trade and that was after many e-mails back and forth proving that I am legally allowed to do so.Second is deposit/withdraw. If I can't get my money in or out, it is useless. If it costs money to get money in, that detracts.Third is the cost per trade.Liquidity helps but if you have time you can eventually convert your fiat to bitcoins even with low liquidity.Security is a given. If you lose peoples' coins, your business is likely done unless you have a clean track record and immediately rectify the situation. Even then it is a ding that would warn me to stay away. That looks like yet another "We like the blockchan but not Bitcoin".I don't understand why people would not want to incorporate into the Bitcoin blockchain considering it is the most secure ledger in the world.In the news: NASDAQ blockchain taken out by a 51% attack Or learn a trade. Start a career. Hmm, I am a bit skeptical on the 21 Inc thing. That article just screamed of vaporware. A whole lot of ideas of what can be done with Bitcoin just like a bunch of people posting ideas on here.Great ideas and all...but it sounds like marketing pitches to VCs that could easily just be cashed out and the company closed while the owners take the money and retire.It would be like me going to a VC saying "Bitcoin can be used for voting, microtransactions, be your own bank, crowdfunding...now give me money and be part of this exciting company of the future! What have I done to make any of this happen? ... The blockchain!". Forget online. Sign up for localbitcoins. Buy/Sell bitcoins locally for a profit. Undercut everyone else in your area and instead of driving to deliver pizza, drive to deliver bitcoins. The transfer of value does not take 10 minutes.Should we just post this every 5 posts on every confirmation thread on the board?Bitcoin transactions take seconds. Bitcoin confirmations take 10 minutes.Credit card transactions take seconds. Credit card confirmations take 180 days.Confirmations != transactions Report: off topicThings are going to start happening now... Ya, that's why I don't see the confirmation times as that big of a deal. As long as the transaction went through, it will be confirmed eventually. If it's down to a minute and people start requiring that you stick around for that first confirmation because "it's only a minute" and then it actually takes 5 minutes people will be on here bitching about confirmations taking too long. You did or did not have to wait?Even if the confirmation takes that long it should show up as a transaction. For breakfast they should not be worried about confirmations. Satoshi said that after a few seconds it becomes very difficult.You would probably have to initiate a simultaneous spend on the other side of the planet and hope that the miners there find a block before the miners near the transaction find it. Strange, like you're going to attempt a double spend on a few dollars at a newspaper store. Most merchants use some sort of third party service like BitPay that mitigates the risk. Cool that she's old school but she should know she doesn't need to wait all that time.She doesn't keep people there 180 days while their credit card transaction becomes non-reversible. As someone who lives almost exclusively on Bitcoin I have not once had a problem due to confirmations taking 10 minutes.Most real world uses of Bitcoin I have been able to send my Bitcoin transaction in seconds.Transaction time is in seconds, confirmation time is in 10 minute blocks (for those who still have yet to figure this out).Just like your credit card takes a few seconds for the transaction. But the credit card confirmation time is 180 days.Some websites require that you wait 3 confirmations, but if you order something online what is the big deal with waiting 30 minutes? Is your order going to be shipped the next day 30 minutes slower? You order it, send the bitcoins and walk away (I usually check blockchain.info to verify that the transaction is on its way).With localbitcoins I usually send via localbitcoins which is instantaneous. The few times I have had someone want me to send it to his wallet, it took seconds for him to see that the transaction went through. The reputation system discourages me from attempting to reverse the transaction.The one time I had a guy that wanted to wait for a confirmation it was reasonable. It was a fairly large transaction and we were chilling in McDonalds so it was no big deal, he even bought me some McNuggets for the wait.So...have you ever had a real world situation where you actually sent your bitcoins with the transaction fee and were inconvenienced by the 10 minute confirmation? Price is up $1.Da moon? This:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vlbgt/strip_club_in_portland_accepts_bitcoin/Andhttp://cointelegraph.com/news/112825/its-raining-bitcoins-on-strippers-in-tampaKasmir Hill on her week living on Bitcoin went to a strip club ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/05/11/living-on-bitcoin-a-year-later-all-grown-up-and-a-little-naughty/ ):
Gavin has put a date of March 2016 to upgrade the block size to 20Mb. During the year 2020 the price will be over $1500/BTC. I think those that are worried about 10 minute confirmations are mostly people that don't use Bitcoin very often. "10 minute confirmations!?! WTFOMG!! I won't wait that long at a fast food restaurant!"transaction time != confirmation timeBitcoin is faster than dogecoin and litecoin because of the amount of nodes. Looks like an IP block. I can still access it from work on a US system. I will not advertise how that is working out for them  https://btcjam.com/https://bitlendingclub.com/https://www.bitbond.com/https://btclend.org/https://cryptostocks.com/http://mpex.co/http://www.bitpools.comhttp://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-media-after-death/http://www.coindesk.com/how-block-chain-technology-is-working-to-transform-intellectual-property/ Ok, I've read several mentions of it and listened to some talk of it but I would like to know a bit more about how using the blockchain would work as a public ledger of stocks.From what I am understanding, in theory, I could take maybe 1 bitcoin and split it into 1 million bits with an address for each one designating it as a "stock". Then take that list and make it publicly available. If you want to buy a share, say for $1 per share the company would send you the bit to your address and thanks to the transparency of the blockchain, since you know the original address, you can track any address it transfers to. You can then sell your share to anyone else by sending that bit to someone else.Is this how it works?Does colored coins make this simpler? I am sure there are other things that came out that do this as well that I heard about.I'm not looking at creating a separate blockchain since Bitcoin has the built in security of petabytes of computing power behind it.  Had a dream last night that the price was $252, I was sort of disappointed because I sold a few coins on bitquick and was ready to buy back in on another dip. http://www.billpayforcoins.comthey allow you to pay your bill just like a bank bill pay system, and I was told the fee will come down this week after they roll out a new feature that will make it easy for everyone to do the same thing I'm doing Rally time If BitWage has any problems I would know about it within hours of missing my paycheck. My paycheck is every other Friday, I usually get an e-mail about 6-7PM on that day with the amount of bitcoins deposited into my account and the rate. If this did not happen I could call them, if they give me the run around I would call my company and have them reverse the direct deposit(which would be a hassle, but possible). And from there I would certainly drop them. So at most, one paycheck is lost if they go under. They don't keep peoples bitcoins though. I gave them my bitcoin address that I have in cold storage, they send to that address immediately once the direct deposit goes through.For localbitcoins I am getting 10% above the market rate, I get enough for spending money and rent each month.As for taxes, yes I am avoiding taxes...legally. I live outside the US working for a US company. If you live outside the US for more than 330 days out of the year you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion. This means that the first $100k of my salary is tax free and I can write off any housing costs. My situation is unique in that I work as a contractor for the US military so I do not have to pay taxes in the country I live in (I can even avoid paying VAT, but usually don't bother with the process).  Having a bank account is convenient...for the government to track every transaction that I make. For the banks to control who can and cannot have access to that "convenience". They are a third party holding my funds. If you don't own the private keys, the money is not yours.I have found Bitcoin to be so much more convenient than my bank account. I must have had at least 3 different e-mails telling me on the 1st of the month that my card on file had expired. Companies that could withdraw funds from my account. My friend at work just had over $800 taken out of his bank account this week for his phone bill that was linked to his account. He was having trouble with his phone plan so he switched to a different one on the site. He did not realize that the new plan charged 40 cents per kB of data while all of the plans he used before had data included. I've had so many automatic fees taken out of my bank account that I've had to dispute. One that charged me $50 per month for over a year that I could not get the right number or department to turn it off, finally going to the bank to get them to block it.With Bitcoin I control my money. My hosting service charges me monthly in bitcoins. If I want to stop my service I stop the payments. If I stay at a hotel and they want to tack on some fees after I've left...they cannot, I paid with bitcoins. I don't have to worry about insufficient fund fees kicking in because of a bad ordering of payments which then snowball for a bunch of tiny purchases. I don't have to pay yearly credit card fees or interest payments ever again. I can get paid in bitcoins from my US company and sell those bitcoins for a profit in euros to spend instead of paying for a wire transfer and currency exchange fee plus ATM fees to get the money from my paycheck.That is convenience. I am looking at somewhere around 40 foot catamaran sailboat. I would just live wherever the weather is nice. Though I am looking at seasteading options. They will likely have the first one up in a few years. I will buy it. If Bitcoin is over $1k I will pay the guy with bitcoins. Otherwise I will sell my house and pay for it.As for asking where I got the money...I will likely be buying the boat in a foreign country, most likely registering it under a bahamas flag. If I do pay with bitcoins I will do my darndest to pay the appropriate income taxes because I love the IRS and want to have sex with any agent reading this. I see. I have used cheapflowers before. But I think I'm ok with ordering her some hot sauce and habenero seeds. She loves spicy food and gardening. It won't get there tomorrow but they're usually pretty quick.Good to know though, thanks for the info on the other options. I like following Dave Ramsey's advice on living debt free. Only buy what you can afford, work hard to pay off your debts so you can let your money work for you.My co-workers are driving around expensive Camaros, the latest BMWs, etc. I could afford just about any car I want but I bought a 5000 euro 2006 Smart Roadster. I enjoy driving it, it has great fuel mileage and runs great. I paid cash for it. If the bitcoin price wasn't so low right now I'd be putting more toward paying off my mortgage, I was putting $4k per month toward it last year when the price was high, now I'd rather have that extra money going toward cheap coins. But I should have it paid off in the next couple of years. Then I will be truly debt free and free from the chains of the banks. Being the horrible son that I am I waited until the last minute to order flowers for mom. I usually use cheapflowers.com because they accept Bitcoin but figured I'd try out 1800flowers.com after seeing an article about it on a google search.http://www.coindesk.com/1-800-flowers-com-latest-retailer-add-bitcoin-payments/I went to order something and there was no bitcoin option. I'm too late anyway. Looks like mom will have to get some hot sauce from pexpeppers a few days later. I'm certainly not the first to drop my credit card. Dave Ramsey encourages people to drop their credit cards and switch to cash all the time. Plenty of people do it all the time. Getting rid of the bank will be different but I don't think impossible. As for buying another house, my next permanent home will likely be on a seastead or sailboat. I left the US and do not see returning unless they have a USSR moment.Rental car will be difficult, most places I have traveled to in Europe I opt out of getting a rental and just get a hotel in the city and walk everywhere. I always book my hotel rooms through expedia which accepts Bitcoin so there's no problem there.For things online that require a credit card, I used to rely on brawker.com but now I need to figure out a new way. Hopefully the Bitcoin community fills the vacuum that them leaving has created.. As nobody was forcing them one way or another, technically it was the free market.Voluntary trade may be a foreign concept to most people of the world. But some people actually prefer it.
This isn't an every day site but I used it so I'll give it a review here.http://www.pexpeppers.comLiving in Germany they think ketchup is spicy. I like some of my food to be spicy. I have Tabasco but that's just a flavoring. I ordered the Killer Swarm: https://www.pexpeppers.com/product/pexpeppers-killerswarm/It does the job. Made with scorpion peppers it has a good kick to it. I added it to some wing sauce and it was quite tasty, I just added a few squirts to about 12 wings to it wasn't too hot. But I tried a plain finger dab when I first got it. At first I didn't feel it but then it kicked in good. Some good burn, but not overwhelming. Someone already checked on direct deposit from their tenants, bitwage.co will convert those to bitcoins. There are no fees but I have noticed the price they use for paying me is about 1% above the price on most exchanges so that is probably where they are getting their cut. Great service though. I'm currently paid 100% in Bitcoin through bitwage.co.  I pay for as much as I can using bitcoins. I actively sell bitcoins on localbitcoins so I usually have plenty of cash for buying food and paying rent.If they shut down my bank account I can probably have my tenants direct deposit directly to my bitwage bitcoin address and I am looking at billpayforcoins.com to see if they can handle my mortgage payment. My goal this year is definitely to go into 2016 with no bank account. I have confidence in the Bitcoin community filling the final pieces necessary to do that. When posting polls, who tends to be listed first? My Amex card expired last year, they may have sent a new card but I don't live there anymore. I'll get around to officially turning that one off, I've had an Amex since '97. I called a few months ago and cut off my Mastercard and verified that my Bank of America card was turned off.That left me with my bank's debit card. That expired at the end of April.I still have my bank account, I have my house rented with direct deposit into my bank account and I turn around and pay my mortgage from there so I haven't taken that final step to close that account. Plus I figured I can just use my bank account to buy/sell bitcoins until they shut down my account like they do with so many people.I do have a deutsche bank account card that I use to deposit cash into my account. I tend to get more through localbitcoins than I spend so I just convert the extra cash back to bitcoins so I don't have to turn people away who want to buy bitcoins with cash.Here's the thread with links and reviews of places I use regularly that accept bitcoin: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0 If the credit card thing works the way that it works for my bank account I buy bitcoins at a set price and it takes a few days for the money to transfer over. But the price is locked in when you buy. Thank you guys, I used the service and updated the OP. Pretty cool ordering food with bitcoins. So you're buying at $225 selling at $228...you make a few trades maybe get back a few percent on your investment. Then the price drops to $190 and you think...oh shit, this is it, Bitcoins is done for...better sell! It goes to $180 and rebounds going up to $250..oh shit, can't miss out on it going to $1000 again better buy...price drops back down to $225. You now have half of what you started with and are wondering wtf just happened.In poker if you sit down at the table you can usually tell who the fish is. The guy that everyone else is there to take money from.If you sit down and don't see the fish. You're the fish.Convert and spend. In my travels around Europe I always try to find a place that uses Bitcoin when I visit. When I was in Amsterdam in the fall I went to one bar and had a beer because they accepted Bitcoin. When I asked to pay the waitress had to ask the bartender, the bartender pulled out an iPad from under the bar. It was dead so he needed to charge it up to get it going. I don't remember what the final outcome was from the iPad but he couldn't get it to work so I just paid in cash.I went to London for a Bitcoin conference and there was only one Bitcoin place in the area, a hamburger restaurant. I couldn't really tell if it was at a location or if it was a lunch truck. It was not open on the weekend that I was there.In Vienna the restaurant near the hotel accepted Bitcoin but it was a very high end restaurant with a long waiting list and the food they served was not all that appealing to me anyway so I did not try it.I did find a great bar in Budapest ( http://www.ankerklub.hu ) that I was able to pay at the bar in bitcoins and they even gave me 10% off of the bill for doing so.In Milan I went to a pizza restaurant run by a Chinese family that accepted Bitcoin. I had to help the guy a little bit to show the cashier how to use his BitPay app.I might go to Belgium this month, I heard something about Bitcoin in one of the towns there. I'll have to check it out.No definitive hub yet that I have seen. I would like to be able to go to a tourist town and say I have only bitcoins, give me an itinerary for the weekend where I can eat, sleep, buy a few souvenirs and do a few tours paying for each place with bitcoins. Supply and demand. There is a limited supply which is all taken up.While a small country's economy could run on 1 bitcoin with its divisibility, that would mean anyone else holding 1 bitcoin can now buy the economy of that small country. And 25 of those are created every 10 minutes. The last halving was November 2012.Here is what happened over the course of the next few months after the halving. (the price going up to the halving did not go up much because there was a lot of uncertainty of how it would affect Bitcoin) It's not like this is that big of a stretch in a prediction. He is talking about 2017/2018.It is very likely that the price will rise in much the same as the last halving. The next halving is toward the end of 2016. After the last halving it took about 4-5 months to go from $12 to $266. It is not unreasonable to say that the next halving will have a similar response.There is also a good feeling that the price has stopped falling. Not that the price is about to shoot up but most likely we have seen the bottom, which is encouraging. Look at the order of the results. Is it alphabetical? Based on the numbers? That ignores the fact that China was the initial exchange in most major price movements. And MtGox de-coupled from all of the other exchanges when it came to price. Everyone knew that it was not real. People were even paying 10:1 for "MtGox coins" toward the end. They tended to be 10-30% higher price than all of the other exchanges. Also this: 21  So you invested in an altcoin. Bully for you.Go discuss it in the alt coin section. There has to be a way with today's social media to track down the guy that puts up the charts and ask him why he chose that order for the graphic. They've started already. Looks like we know who Fox News is pushing for this election season. Money laundering laws are another way of saying "we want to track everything you do with your money, if you don't comply you support terrorists".
Thread #29801 trying to push alt coins with less security. This is why I burn CDs to move files from cold storage. There are some interesting tidbits in that article. One interesting part I noticed was this:"But Casares noticed that every time he helped another one of his wealthy friends start buying Bitcoins, prices rose, suggesting to him that they were responsible for much of the increase. Over the course of March, the price of a single Bitcoin nearly tripled, to around $100"All of the charts and trend analysis cannot predict some guy encouraging his wealthy friends to buy a lot of bitcoins. It also cannot account for someone who has a lot of bitcoins that needs to sell them all to pay for a house or yacht. We seem to still be in the place where the price jumps by a lot all at once, which is likely these types of scenarios. But over time with more money on the exchanges hundreds of thousands of dollars will not be moving the price as much as it does right now. Bitcoin is meant to be inflationary in its first years. We are going from $0 worth of bitcoins to billions. The initial goal was to try to hit that sweet spot where new money coming into bitcoin matched the mining costs going out.One example of money coming into Bitcoin is something like bitwage. I am currently converting all of my paychecks to bitcoins every 2 weeks through bitwage. Let's say that I am bringing in 10 bitcoins worth of pay every 2 weeks (it's actually a bit more but we will go with 10 for ease). That is fiat currency being converted to bitcoins. Essentially money flowing into the bitcoin economy.With 3600 bitcoins being created each day, that is 50400 bitcoins created every 2 week pay period.If only 5040 people do the same as I do with their pay, then all mined bitcoins leaving the bitcoin ecosystem have an equal amount of bitcoins entering the ecosystem. That one action cancels out the mining costs.At the current price, there are about $25 million worth of bitcoins "leaving the ecosystem" (if you go with the horrible assumption that bitcoin miners have no interest in bitcoin whatsoever) monthly.That is peanuts in the world of finance. That amount of VC money flows into Bitcoin companies regularly. I know they are not buying bitcoins but they are investing in the technology which then makes Bitcoin better and encourages even larger amounts of funds to flow into Bitcoin.And think of all of the people who say that Bitcoin is used just for drugs. The world drug trade is currently over $300 billion per year. If Bitcoin made up just .1% of the world drug trade, all mining costs would be paid for (just from that one industry).The remittance market made over $600 billion last year. Gold value is in the trillions, e-commerce, currency exchanges, etc. etc...Worrying about the tiny cost of Bitcoin mining compared to the incoming flow of money is like complaining that the cost of paper for $100 bills is going to tank the dollar.Will the mining cost prevent Bitcoin from being worth $1 million/BTC any time soon? Sure. That is the built in inflation of about 12% (next year, 6% and 4 years later 3%...). But the money flowing in is why we are not at $1/BTC anymore. I have met several people who still have not heard of it.  They are looking long term to make a business out of those bitcoins which would pay out more over time than what they could sell them for. I am willing to sell my bitcoins to anyone at $50 below the $1750/BTC value.PM me for this exciting opportunity, first come first served, while supplies last. Thanks for testing it out. I added delete and edit functionality. We heard the same stuff before the first halving. Miners would stop and the difficulty would be so difficult that it would never adjust, blocks would take years to complete.It was all true. Bitcoin ended that day. The bears won. I dumped all of my Roth IRAs years ago. The promise is that any earnings on the Roth will be tax free when you retire.I do not see that being case in a few decades when I retire.I doubt we will even have the same government in a few decades when I retire. Many would agree that Henry Ford was a fascist/socialist. He came up with a great idea, implemented brilliantly bringing the Model T which was ahead of its time. He also invented the production line which was also brilliant. I grew up admiring Henry Ford for those very things. Upon further research I found that his socialist/fascist tendencies tended to get in the way of being competitive moving forward. He just wanted to keep churning out Model Ts forever with the focus on making more, cheaper. He did not, however, focus on improving his design. Competitors caught up and surpassed his original vehicle and his son had to fight to push new model vehicles out to keep up. His father just focused on building larger factories and pushing out more Model Ts. Converting those large factories for military vehicles is probably what saved the company from bankruptcy.As for Hitler, I will admit that I just threw him out because he was a member of the National Socialist party, not because I believe he was some huge bastion of socialism like Mussolini. But socialists (I will avoid saying communists because I know you prefer the term progressive or socialist these days) tend to blame the leaders who gain power in such regimes only to "not implement socialism right".But, like I tell my conservative friends who complain about welfare programs, you gave them the power. Your system helped to grow the government to the point that they can do whatever they want. If a thief robs you and spends your money on drugs you shouldn't be upset that he spent the money on drugs and go on a tirade about how he should have used the money for food. He took your money.Socialism takes power from the people. Those that believe in the ideal might think that the perfect system would then be to distribute that power equally among all of the people. But guess what? Too late. They took the power. They could give a rats ass about what system gave them that power or what they promised to do with it. It is now their power and they can do whatever they want with it because you were too stupid to protect that power. So socialism is the best breeding ground for people like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Che, Mussolini, Bush, Obama, Clinton etc. They will take your power and do whatever they want with it.  It is up:http://www.bitpools.com/forumI have been focused on improving the startup capabilities so I have not done much on the forum side of things other than cleaning up a few bugs here and there. This has been answered.  He gets status points which can be redeemed for dinner party and conference invites.It is a very competitive world to get such valuable points. I spend about half of my life on pro-socialist forums like hitlerpraise.com and stalinforums.com talking about how ridiculous they all are and that their ideal of everyone making the same pay for different levels of work will never succeed. I do it for the children.  Those that complain about the miners selling their bitcoins are the same ones that put their heads in the sand when it comes to the halving next year.If all of the miners are selling all of their bitcoins right now and we are maintaining a stable price even with that happening...what happens when that $800,000 per day being converted to fiat is cut down to $400,000?  Ya, I learned early on that I am not good with day trading. Lost about 400 bitcoins doing so.Fortunately it was when the price was under $10.If you are not a day trading expert, just buy and hold (better yet, convert and spend). Start to worry when the socialists start to like Bitcoin.I am just fine with reading HuffPo and Salon and seeing all of the liberals talking about staying away from Bitcoin.The best path forward is if they are all stuck with their fiat. The best thing for the world is for them to all be in fiat.  Nah, Proudhon believed in Bitcoin he just thought the price was too high.Then he revealed that he was actually bullish after the price dropped but didn't want to break character.
We should also figure out how best to build cars and houses for dinosaurs. You are free to check the source code to see Gavin's contributions. I had considered this as a way of buying bitcoins with credit cards.You go to the site, you buy your bitcoins with your credit card. But because a purchase can be reversed up to 180 days you would not actually get bitcoins, you would get a token that represents a bitcoin until it "matures" after 180 days. At that point actual bitcoins replace your token.People could trade these tokens if they wanted to and would likely sell for less than their value before they mature.Why would anyone do this? Bitcoin drops 20-30% in a few hours and you believe it will bounce back. You don't have any money on any exchange, you don't have any money in your bank account but you have a credit card with a high limit. You buy knowing that in 180 days you can sell those coins or use them at a higher value. this One of the partners is a developer who has done similar projects and is very active in the seasteading community. He has been working with the designer to come up with something within the goal.We are not looking at US prices and labor costs. The initial floating platform costs were low but I am sure we will likely see many more costs when the Bahama government comes into the picture. We are still in the pre-announce stage but the design and location are taking shape.We are shooting for a cost of around $5 million offering 50,000 shares of $100 each. The initial businesses on the platform will be part of the company and boat slips will be paid to the company with the profits going to the shareholders. This song sums up the 1st of Mayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCbD8nsxcd8&feature=youtu.be Definitely, it takes a lot of work to keep track of the market and buy at the right time and risk to keep me employed.And the American voter who votes for more taxes to give government more power so they can pay for the military which keeps me employed. Thanks for taxing the rich American voter! I sent a card to the CEO of my company thanking for all of his hard work which keeps me employed.It's all about thanking the workers today. The main location we are looking at is Cay Sal Bank just south of the Keys, north of Cuba within Bahamas territory.More than likely the restrictions will be the same as living in the Bahamas. Our initial step is creating a viable business and creating a launching platform for seasteads as opposed to actually being a seastead so it is not about politics during this phase.There are no sand banks in international waters. The best I have found during my search has been a sea mount that is 100 meters deep.I doubt we could get much investment capital for Sealand. People want something in a warm climate. More people need to start using bitwage.co to convert all or part of their paychecks to bitcoins.We need a viable replacement for brawker.com. Possibly via OpenBazaar? Bitcoin's problem is fiat. And people don't care because they want higher fiat prices. I care about women in space.Can they breath? The pressure? How did they get there? The pilot project will likely be built in the Bahamas with permission from the Bahamas government. At this phase we are looking at a hybrid seastead to be built on columns in shallow water which floating platforms and boats can attach to.More of a marina as a launching point.One of the partners is working with the Bahama government, introducing it as a research project.A used cruiseliner was what Project Blueseed tried. They also tried to fund it via donations, we will be selling shares and be getting revenue from the marina businesses. Different differentiations of power between the people and their governments.Some people have been able to keep their government power in check. Others have lost control thanks to high taxes. I am not sure that another jump like the rise to $1200 is in the cards.The huge jumps in the past were based on the idea that we were going to reach critical mass.I think we have reached it and the adoption rate is steady. We have had so much good news this past year that I can't see anything that would rally people to believe that the price will be several times higher than its current price.Though I can see a price discovery point when the mining reward halves. I have seen a large thrust in the US to get rid of any amount of being a man that they can find.Every sitcom shows the man as a dope who just needs to get out of the way while the woman handles things.The idea that a new industry can be dominated by capable men goes counter to the storyline and needs to be squashed. I am so glad that it is a big world and not all women are American. Collectivism. That's all it is.It is about taking away the idea that we are individuals, but instead that we belong to some sort of "group". It serves the author's agenda to make people think of themselves as a collective. As long as they can put themselves into a high position among the collective by creating articles that bash those outside of the collective. Same thing is done with race, sexual preference, wealth, etc. So the bear/bull fight comes down to whether we are hovering around the $220s or whether we are hovering around the $230s.Quite the battle. A midget gif is a valid response to a $10 jump.It is a valid response to just about anything actually...
 Modern scientists do not use raw data, they use editorialised data that supports their conclusion.Just look at the global warming myth. So how else am I supposed to convert my US dollar paycheck to pay for things here in Europe where I can get 10% in additional value when converting bitcoins to euros?Should I just stick with the bank where they charge me a 3% conversion fee and $40 wire transfer fee?Just because someone is being called names? There are also large institutions in play that cannot invest outside of that little world. This is their window into the Bitcoin world. Does GBTC make it possible to convert your 401k to bitcoins? This would be useful. Though ANX already does this. Competition is always good though.  If you truly believe this is what is happening right now then you should be buying as many bitcoins as you can.If this much money is leaving the ecosystem each day and the price is still maintaining its relatively steady state, then next year when the mining reward is halved that would mean that the money leaving the ecosystem that is currently maintaining stability will be cut in half.That is a lot of money not leaving Bitcoin. Thus it is certain that the price will rise by that much money every day.So consider these low prices as a great thing. You get to buy more bitcoins between now and the halving. That is always a risk. That's very progressive of you, I am sure the ladies will appreciate the effort to empower women. You could follow the lead of many journalists who are just merely writing books about how Bitcoin will fail.The key is to one-up the other socialists in demonstrating your loyalty to the party line. This gives you more credibility within the group and gives you the all mighty status which is the quest of all socialists.It might be difficult to compete for such status, but with the free market of competition you should be able to come up with a new and more ingenious way of getting your message of Bitcoin hate to the most people so that you might gain that status income so you can be the most status wealthy person among your peers. Maybe take advantage of new technologies to give you a competitive edge against your status competitors.Professor Bitcorn may have had a failed prediction but he gained much status among his fellow socialists. He was invited to many dinner parties and conferences because of it. But he had the advantage of first out of the gate status, that tends to help against the competition. Yes, there is a coin called Bitcoin that has transaction times in a few seconds. You may want to give it a try. Before starting with bitwage.co I used to convert every paycheck to bitcoins. That would be thousands of dollars per month. I also have used it for localbitcoins just because of the convenience of their QR scanner.Looks like I'll have to move those few bitcoins I have on there to a mobile wallet.Getting euros to pay for things through localbitcoins is "personal use" for me. I would sell all of my bitcoins if someone was paying me twice the current price and I could easily get that money back on the exchange so I could convert it all back to bitcoins. It did push Bitstamp up a few bucks. Shenanigans claim verified. A socialist professor? Wow...how rare  Enjoy your microcosm. Try not to get burned too much by the exposure to the real world.Your fellow "intellectuals" will welcome you home with open arms though if you run into any trouble.If you really want to impress the echo chamber you should come out with a hard hitting article about how bad Bitcoin is. Make a big claim about the price dropping below $10 before some future date.Then sit back and await the dinner parties and conference invites. Yet another liberal who is not able to imagine a future where a technology improves things. What a surprise. Sending from the same address gives it more "priority". I'm done helping you promote your signature campaign.
Actually, if bitcoin is able to keep up with the dollar this year it is doing better than 99% of world currencies.When I arrived in Germany last summer the rate was $1.35 / euro. Today it is $1.08.The dollar is exceeding other currencies because the Fed plans to raise interest rates while other countries are planning on pumping more money into their economies.But I can see the dollar triggering some very bad economic moves when they do raise the rates later this year. Very cool, I had always thought that an open source exchange was needed so that people all over the world can open a local exchange with very little up front capital.Thank you. BitPay does not hold the private keys of the buyer. It converts bitcoins to fiat for the merchant. https://blockchain.info/tx/ed451475658e223faa12782abdd73eed08e0ed7f1a34799076cefa0104662aa3it was posted in this thread...  Most merchants use BitPay. BitPay handles transactions just like Visa handles transactions.  http://www.google.com Or, like anywhere else, you use a third party that handles that trust for you. The dude actually posted a link of his transaction. A place that could be checked in less than a second. That does not exist on HIS COMPUTER.Do some reading. 0 Confirmations is as reasonable as trusting your credit card transaction that takes a few seconds.A credit card transaction can be reversed up to 180 days after the transaction. A Bitcoin transaction can "theoretically" be reversed up to a few minutes after the transaction.Most transactions are between people voluntarily doing business with each other. A business that is mutually beneficial and includes a relationship of trust. If you do not trust the person you are doing business with, then you either need a mechanism to handle the trust or you need to wait 10 minutes. Bitcoin is not a community. It is a technology. It works with or without the community acknowledging anything. I was responding to an implication of BS.Why does confirmation matter in your case OP? Confirmation did not matter. We met through localbitcoins. I have a 100% reputation with over 50 trades. For me to reverse the transaction on someone and sacrifice that reputation would be stupid.Even when I sold a rather large amount of bitcoins to someone they were ok with just the transaction going through. We had traded before and we both understand that we want to continue trading in the future for our own mutual benefit. I sold someone some bitcoins last night. From my phone to his it took about 15 seconds before the transaction went through. I'm not waiting for anything. I'm converting and spending. The dollar is in the past. Isn't LGBTC that BitShares scam?edit: Oh, I see...BitTrust not Shares. Good news then. Glad my bitcoin paycheck went through today. This very whiny article ( http://fusion.net/story/124655/why-bitcoins-male-domination-will-be-its-downfall/ ) says that there are not enough women using Bitcoin. So, just as most stupid reporters that talk about "inequality" and other collectivist drivel, they would likely want the government to step in and do something.What do you believe the punishment should be for women who do not use Bitcoin which would satisfy the reporter's thirst for government power? The nice thing about Bitcoin is that it gives Darwinism a shot in the arm.Let them believe what they want. You may want to check these guys out: https://www.bitrated.com Just ordered a bottle. I appreciate that you ship to APO. It's hard to get spicy in Germany. A Roman walks into the bar and holds up two fingers and says:"I'll have five beers please."
It seems like every little thing that has to do with someone interacting with money recently is being interfered with in the name of "money laundering" laws.Why are we just accepting the idea that money needs to be controlled so that the "bad guys" can't use it? Putting restrictions on every little thing in the name of whatever Money Laundering laws are supposed to be fighting?Don't those laws make the dollar less fungible? Pretty much destroying the currency?$1 held by a drug dealer no longer equates to $1 held by a liquor store owner. The drug dealer needs to pay extra to get $1 worth of value from that one dollar.Louisiana used "money laundering" to pass a law against using cash to buy used stuff ( http://liberty247.net/its-now-illegal-to-use-cash-to-buy-used-goods-in-this-state/ ).They use it to make sure every bank has tons of information on us, every Bitcoin exchange needs to know all about us. It makes it harder to move your cash around, giving Bitcoin a huge advantage over holding dollars.When the money the drug dealers hold is worth less than the rest of the money it actually funnels more money to drug dealers since they can charge more and they need more to work within the black market. That is why they end up with stacks and stacks of money. It actually gives them an advantage over everyone else in the world of cash.It's just insane. Coinbase is the easiest in the US. You can have your Coinbase account linked to your bank account in minutes and make the purchase. I suspect it is because you are pointing to the 0.8.5 version for the 12k number. You may need to add the statistics for each version to get the new total. There was always a lot of discussion on ronpaulforums about alternative currencies. He is right that most people focused on metal coins due to the Austrian economics.I probably chimed in with my idea of putting advertising on the coins to pay for the minting so that the currency was at the spot value. Ya, I pulled out "all" of my coins when Dwolla dropped them. .4 was some left over dust I just filed through Kraken. It was pretty easy.Kraken may have set up a simple user interface to get customers to sign up with their service. You have to have Tier 2 authentication with their site before you can move forward (which I already had).Hopefully I can get my .4 BTC back. I am pretty sure that Congress does not use Federal Reserve notes for their spending. Their money is a mutation of the actual dollars we hold.So there are intermediaries between your dollars and what Congress eventually spends.Does it matter if another intermediary takes bitcoin and plugs into that conversion process? Good idea on different types of platforms depending upon industry. Plastic is not good for the ocean due to the saltwater but that could change with technology. There does seem to be a lot of algae science that people bring up. Looks like some great potential.I will be presenting a capsule type of design to the Seasteading Institute in about a month. The building materials for the smallest living unit (dorm room sized) should be under $2,000 which could get the price between $10-$20k for a finished unit. With the price coming down over time with mass production. Full disclosure, today I used some dollars to buy a hot dog and chips. It is the first time in weeks that I have used dollars. I won a hundred bucks on our office Super Bowl pool so I sometimes spend that money on small things like that. But that money will likely last me at least a year.I get my dollar based paycheck converted to bitcoins using bitwage.co via direct deposit.I get euros via localbitcoin to pay for things like rent and food (though I just found http://www.takeaway.com and will give it a try this week). Though I am slowly working on getting my landlord to accept bitcoins. Brawker going away has been the biggest hit for me. That is awesome how you have experienced everything.What parts of the world did you enjoy visiting the most? How many Asian countries did you get to visit? Bitcoin has replaced the dollar for me.So, is it possible? Yes.Is it likely? No.Does it matter that idiots will continue to use fiat? Some people still have landline phones. Doesn't bother me. This site is pretty awesome. They have service here in my small town in Germany too. They will even deliver beer. I will definitely give it a try this weekend. So many people are trying to convert their fiat to bitcoins.You already have bitcoins. Spend them. Put them to use. Bitcoin can be used to pay for startup companies.Just one more thing that Bitcoin can be used for. https://www.bitquick.co/ allows you to get cash deposited directly into your bank account for your bitcoins. Of course you need to give your bank account number but only the site and the person buying will see the number.http://www.cheapair.com allows you to book your flight using bitcoins.http://www.expedia.com allows you to book your hotel room using bitcoins.Unless you are doing something in-person, someone is going to need some information when you use the Internet to buy something. Updated with my AnxPro debit card review. Looks like I need to consider other cards. Yes, like RocketSingh said. This has been done at BitPools.com though not for the purpose of national elections. I would rather move forward than focus on making a failed system of governance more "efficient". Using the blockchain for electing new tyranny is like using the blockchain to improve banking operations.With BitPools voting, we take a group of people voting on something and provide them with proposals. When a proposal is submitted for vote each person in the group has a public address assigned to them.The list of all of those public addresses is then encrypted into a single file and released to everyone.Once the vote date passes, the decryption key is released as well as the unencrypted file with all of the public addresses used for the vote.Then it is just a matter of tallying the vote from the list of addresses on the blockchain.If you wanted to do this for electing your new master you would just need to ensure that each person is given their public address for voting in a way that people don't see what address they are given. Some sort of automated hologram sticker thing could probably work. http://www.thelocal.se/20141012/sweden-close-to-being-cashless-society-reportSome countries will be cashless soon enough. Not just from cryptocurrencies. A paper contract on its own is of use.I have a piece of paper that says I own the earth.The only way that becomes true is if an entity that owns a lot of guns recognizes it as valid. There are already a lot of people collecting bitcoins:http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=casascius+coin&_sacat=0
I live in Europe. I am exempt from US income taxes and have the bonus of being exempt from the VAT (though I have to fill out a form to do it). While this is a much larger project than we are working on, we are using this type of design on a smaller scale:Concrete is brittle, that is why rebar is used, I have built some floating prototypes with concrete with no support and you are right, they fall apart after a few weeks. And concrete actually hardens more when in the water under constant pressure. There are many examples of concrete structures in the ocean. Some WWII structures are still standing.Here is a very detailed engineering report done addressing most of the engineering challenges:http://seasteading.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DeltaSync-Final-Concept-Report.pdfPersonally I will be submitting a design that will get the costs down less than $10k for a small living environment (about dorm room sized). The Seasteading Institute ( http://www.seasteading.org ) is doing a design contest in June which should result in some great concepts.I agree that being in a harbor under the laws of another country are certainly not ideal. But what we have right now are zero seasteads. This will be the first one. The Wright Brothers' first airplane had terrible food service, the bathrooms were quite uncomfortable and the in flight movie selection was pretty much non-existant. But they had to start somewhere. United States highest tax rate: >60%Caymen Islands highest tax rate: 0%You have a company that can be placed anywhere in the world. Which do you choose? So you are resigned to the idea that Earth land is the last explored place to live in the universe? Like those car phones. I didn't really have time to do much with this but from a quick count, there are 24 flames on each side, 2 layers each...that's 192There are 9 rows of 7 squares inside. That's 63.192+63 is 255 (256 bits in a private key).The flames can easily be 1s and 0s based on height. Some are obscured so you will need to brute force those. The pattern of counting would start in the top right going counter clockwise according to the drawing in the corner. The inner square would start in the bottom right going clockwise according to the drawing in the top right corner.Not sure of what the binary pattern for the checkerboard would be. Maybe they are 1 or 0 based on the colors unless the square contains a leaf. Yes, I have an updated release that is pending. I locked down the site this past few months so good that I locked myself out yesterday when I went to put in the update. So I have been working with the hosting service to restore access. Ok, while many solutions are discussed ad nauseum among seasteaders and no one solution is the best I will address what you listed:We're not talking about a boat here, we're talking about platforms (around 50 to 100 meters wide) that can interlock and expand to a city sized seastead.The popular consensus has been that it should be built out of concrete. This will last hundreds if not thousands of years. One of our experts has built similar structures and there are many working examples of floating concrete platforms (one even has a landing strip on it).Cost is certainly a factor. You could buy something in middle of the US but the first million dollars that your community brings in will get the attention of the government.Our initial estimates on cost using concrete are fairly comparable to oceanfront real estate. As the platform can float and be located anywhere we are looking at affluent harbors where real estate prices are in the millions. That makes our housing options very competitive giving a good return on investment.The seastead will be far more than 20 people. The investment group has planned to build at least 6 businesses into the initial structure with one business actually being the building of more seasteads. It will likely be a tourist destination which will provide plenty of monetary inflow.The initial seastead will not be remote. But we have certainly discussed such a thing down the line. The seastead community will need to be large enough to warrant such a move which comes with several costs such as breakwaters, mooring and several other factors including establishing a trade route. The popular opinion being that we should position it within an established trade route and take advantage of that as a hub.Waves and saltwater are the constant issue being addressed when it comes to engineering. Like I said, the initial one will be in a harbor because we will be focusing first on engineering and a viable business model. Breakwaters and designs to minimize wave impact are a constant discussion.It is our hope that a medical facility will be one of the main businesses providing medical tourism. People are willing to fly to foreign countries for lower cost medical treatments due to a lot less red tape and more freedom. Medical advances will likely thrive on a seastead.Entertainment will be abundant. Swimming, fishing, SCUBA, nightclubs, concerts, boating, jet skis, you name it. There will likely be different political structures for each seastead. Initially we will be under the laws of whichever nation we fly our flag under and whichever nation's harbor we are docked in will have limited jurisdiction, there are many legal issues that have been discussed when it comes to nation laws and distance from land. When it comes to seasteads outside of the EEZ, each seastead will have to come up with the societal structure that they like best. And with multiple of these, we can essentially have government startups. Some will succeed, others will fail. When you can float your house away to another seastead, there will be competition to keep people.While we will not be settling in in heavily pirate populated areas, there will be no shortage of guns owned by seasteaders.Just like with trade routes, ideally we would set up in a place where we can become an Internet hub with underwater cables. As most telecom people can tell you. It is not the cost of the fiber that is expensive but the cost of laying the cable (government fees, regulations, lobbying, etc). There can also be satellite which is more expensive and not good for real time streaming but will be good for redundancy. In a harbor we will likely do a microwave type of setup, wifi and underwater cable.Power will be abundant with the power of the sea. OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion), wind, wave power, solar, hydrogen producing algae, etc. Many people suggest selling electricity to the host nation but I think we could use any excess electricity for cheap mining operations.Yes, solar panels are usually rated for 20 years. It would be unwise to pay for anything that does not give a return on the investment over its lifetime. But the price has come down quite a bit on those.Housing will likely not be your typical square house with slanted roof. Most likely dome shaped or containerized housing units (CHUs, which they use in Iraq/Afghanistan) or some other design. OTEC provides fresh water and air conditioning as a bi-product, using the cool water from lower depths will make housing very comfortable.Like I said, there are many solutions so the ones I listed are just cherry picking from several discussions. We have the expertise and our builder does not see any issues in getting the initial platform built once the design is in place and the investment is finalized. That is what we are working on now.I am dedicated to making this happen. I have already left the US and have downsized my lifestyle so that I can pick up and go at any moment. I will definitely be one of the first ones living on the seastead so I have made sure to have my input when it comes to design so that it will be a liveable environment with everything for daily living addressed. Before you say you know what I have not thought of, I have been involved in the seasteading community for almost a decade.We will have a seastead, we have a path forward. It will happen.Everything you listed has been addressed long ago (other than the every woman being crazy thing). This is what I like about the low price right now.People can start coordinating now with a set amount of bitcoins that are reasonable for the average person. Then as the price grows, the opportunities for success grow with it.For example, the initial seastead platform is estimated to cost about $5 million. If the seasteading pool can gather 100 people with 10 bitcoins each (at current prices that is about $2200) they can plan and coordinate their preferences. When the bitcoin price reaches $5k, those 100 people have the funds to execute their plan.Same for any other project that requires time and coordination. The ultimate goal is a sovereign nation.As the technical adviser for the project on all things network related I have made it clear that the seastead has to be able to have access to Bitcoin and most people are ok with Bitcoin as the seastead currency.However, the first seastead will not be sovereign. Our goal for the first project will be to address the engineering hurdles and the business aspect of it. As such we will likely be located in a harbor where real estate values are very high (and under the legal jurisdiction of the host country), essentially creating real estate in an environment where every square foot is expensive. This allows for the capital to succeed and the ability to replicate the process for more seasteads which can then become their own sovereign entities.One of the main businesses will be a data center where the cooling aspect of the sea can be used to cool the computers (and using several options for cheap energy). This will be very useful for a mining operation. There will be different minimums for different discussions. The sitewide minimum is 1 mBTC (about 22 cents).The shills tend to be invested in alt coins or have no bitcoins at all.A Bitrated  link to user profiles will help as well. You are correct, the pool does not hold any money. Using the blockchain we can verify that you hold the funds.We currently only allow one address but multiple addresses is definitely in the works. I don't claim that people will be willing to part with their funds, just that they have the funds available. There is a reason that people go to Shark Tank and pitch their ideas in front of rich VCs instead of pitching to random people on the street.I don't really feel betrayed, that was 10 years ago, it was no big deal. It was just an inefficient way of doing things and a waste of a lot of peoples' time spent dreaming. No plans for implementing signatures. The goal is quality discussion, not a race to get as many posts as possible.If that means less posts then that is ok. Not at all. You just have to have 20 cents in your cold storage wallet. BitPools uses the blockchain to verify that you have a bitcoin balance.The story I use to explain this is a project I was involved in called the Free Town project. There were about 40-50 of us with the same goal, to buy some land in New Hampshire and set up a small community with the goal of liberty. The idea was if we bought a large parcel of land we could get the price per acre down and people could put in something like $5,000 and get around 5 acres.After months of discussion of every little thing from the best location, the rules of the community, how the land would be divided, etc. we finally had a real estate investor set up a corporation for us and he began going to different locations for us and gave us a report on the site. It was nearing the point when we needed to put in the money. Myself and another couple signed a contract and sent $10,000 each (10 acres). Everyone else fell silent. Nobody had that much extra money put aside for the project. They were all talk, more into the idea of a free town than actually putting any money toward it. Myself and the couple got our money back after a few months of waiting for anyone to participate.A lot of time could have been saved if we could have verified up front that people actually had the funds for the project that they were involved in planning.BitPools solves this. And now there is a forum which will allow for communication among people with different levels of Bitcoin involvement. Cold storage is the best way to use BitPools. You just have to move them once to verify your balance. Once everything is loaded for the first time it should be very fast as everything is running on your computer. Updates:Seasteading project name chosen: Marinea http://www.marinea.coForum software up and running at BitPools.com As I mentioned a few months ago here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=959464.0I said that there would be something big on April 15th so I will cut right to it.From the post I purposefully posted  with a capitalized "NO TROLLING". This is the first part.The Internet and especially Bitcoin forums have their fair share of trolls, from the Buttcoin people on reddit to the many people who are heavily invested in their own alt coin that they believe the best way for their coin to succeed is to knock Bitcoin out of the game (so that their cryptocurrency can become the target for the next round of alt coin trolls). There has even been evidence of paid trolls and with the amount of trolls and sock puppets on bitcointalk I would not put it past them being paid as well (see the influx of trolls that will surely join this thread).http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/11/internet_trolls_pose_a_threat_internet_commentators_shouldn_t_be_anonymous.htmlI have been involved with Bitcoin since 2010, back then we were mainly a group of people who wanted to see Bitcoin succeed. Sure we had one or two people that would try to spread FUD to make the price drop but they did so because they too believed in Bitcoin, they just wanted more at cheaper prices. You could go onto the forum and ask serious questions and get serious responses from people who had a similar interest in making Bitcoin grow, and we could coordinate our efforts to further Bitcoin's progress. Now it becomes a matter of trying to play whack a troll with the ignore button.So I came up with a solution. Utilizing the Bitcoin balance verification functionality already built into BitPools I have developed the BitPools forum. http://www.bitpools.com/forumEach forum can be set to require that you hold a minimum amount of mBTC to post in the thread. From as little as 1 mBTC (about 20 cents) to as many as is desired by the group of posters. There is already precedent for this with the Whale Club on teamspeak where people have to prove that they have at least 500 bitcoins to participate. Each forum will obviously not require so many bitcoins but it will at least ensure that everyone involved in the discussion at least shares the commonality of having some bitcoins.A sock puppet or paid trolls will likely be put off by needing to hold so many bitcoins for each user to the point that they hold many of the coins they wish to discredit.The BitPools forum has been built from the ground up with Bitcoin in mind so it can evolve more easily and effectively to meet the needs of the Bitcoin community. There is no need to wait for a new release from some forum software company or deal with the difficulty of trying to put custom features into something that is not built for Bitcoin. While it is in its infancy right now, I have tried to make the functionality and look a cross between bitcointalk and reddit with threads and forums in an easy to traverse tree structure.Now to the second part. In building the social media aspect of BitPools into the forum I have also included it into the Pool functionality so that different projects can more easily coordinate their efforts towards the goal of successfully funding their projects.This brings us to the significance of April 15th.What if April 15th was just another day? The whole point of BitPools is to replace the outdated concept of governments taxing people to pay for their projects. Instead, it allows groups of people with common interests to pool their money and vote with their bitcoins on the solution that they desire.Toward this end, BitPools will be hosting the coordinating efforts of creating the first ever seastead (Marinea http://www.marinea.co). A project to create a self-sustaining town at sea with businesses and housing which will be open to investors who will get a share of the infrastructure. The project has been coordinating via Skype, e-mail and other tools bringing together a very knowledgeable global team of experts around the effort but will more easily be able to coordinate using BitPools social media and voting functionality.Working with the Marinea project, BitPools will be adding functionality as the need is identified which can be used for any project that requires such coordination. This includes Project management tools, Gantt chart tools, chat functionality, file share, calendar and more.By working with the Marinea project, BitPools can demonstrate to all those involved, just how voting with your bitcoins can work toward achieving project goals which can hopefully translate into a new era without taxes and a voluntary society on the seas as a demonstration to the rest of the world that there is a better alternative than the outdated systems we have now.Finally, BitPools will be utilizing Bitrated (https://www.bitrated.com) as their API allows for third party coordination so that all contracts can easily be escrowed with trusted arbitration for the most fair means of funding projects. It will also make available the use of Bitrated trust within the user profile and forum software to further help with interaction without the random troll or sock puppet steering the discussion.It is BitPools' goal to help anyone with a project in mind to most effectively coordinate their efforts toward achieving their goals. Go try it out at http://www.bitpools.comtl;dr  A new Bitcoin forum with bitcoin balance features to discourage trolling and the first ever seastead will be using BitPools for coordination efforts.
It is morning now, I will let you all know this afternoon.The two key things have to do with this: (I did not mess up the capitalization)and this:Fill your cold storage wallets with bitcoins now while the price is cheap. Wish I could buy...but I will continue to HODL! I know you've heard it before from other people trolling for attention when they don't really have anything. But I'm NOt TROLLING. There will be something big on April 15th, I'm sure most people get the significance of that date.Until then... That would have been the case had they not needed to update their submission last summer and then again in January. https://www.mobileshop.ph/ for top up worldwide. Hmm, I did not realize that so many people were paying cash directly to the wholesaler. Do you mail the cash directly to China, maybe overnight it in an envelope or do you fly directly to China to buy your merchandise with cash?Or do you use a third party service like PayPal or Visa on a third party middleman that buys from the wholesaler and sells to you? Or worse, a website that has many retailers that acts as yet another layer between you and the wholesaler?In the beginning it was a chicken and egg thing. No merchant accepted bitcoins so nobody spent bitcoins but since nobody was spending bitcoins no merchant was willing to accept it.Now you can buy practically anything on the Internet with bitcoins but no...not good enough still, you have to buy directly from the wholesaler with bitcoins and the wholesaler has to keep the bitcoins, oh and that's not good enough still because he might live in a country that doesn't pay taxes in bitcoin so he will eventually convert some of your bitcoins to fiat to pay taxes so you will wait until some country accepts bitcoins for taxes, pays all of their public services in bitcoins and never trades with any other country that might want to convert those bitcoins to fiat.Even then people won't be satisfied because the company isn't big enough, they want a big company to not only accept Bitcoin but advertise Bitcoin (would a 10 minute Superbowl commercial suffice?). Because that gives Bitcoin "credibility". Not so you can actually spend it, just so the price will go up so you can cash out to some fiat currency (which you claim to not want any part of during your purchasing experience).So yes, let's refuse to use any third party service to spend bitcoins (at a discount). Instead let's use fiat currency while we wait until we can use bitcoin in the most optimum way possible. Amazon? I bought my last video game from Amazon via purse.io. Actually the price had dropped from over $1200 to almost $850 (MtGox price, which is what CoinBase was using at the time).I think I was lucky enough to buy under $900 before it went back up over $1100.It was certainly a great time to buy.I only wish my phone didn't screw up when it was at the low. Why don't you tell us which alt you invested in think will finish the race? Holding all through this next big run. See you on the other side. Yet another "Bitcoin is terrible" thread...by someone who just so happens to be pushing Alt coins.Mwa mwaaa Just saw that you can rent from http://www.9flats.com for something like AirBnB. I haven't used it but it looks promising.Got that from this link from a guy living just on bitcoins:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2w4dnw/ama_i_have_been_living_almost_exclusively_on_btc/ War hurts everyone. I'd like to be able to buy or top up a Rewe or Real gift card online so I can use brawker.com to essentially buy groceries. Doing a search I see that they sell gift cards for other companies but do they have gift cards for groceries? I think registration is just an e-mail confirmation.You put in a link to the product you want, then you give public details about what you are buying. You put your address and other info in the private area.Then you choose the amount of discount you want. I got 10% discount on a 120 euro purchase, 5% on a quick 30 euro purchase I wanted (I was willing to get less of a discount because I needed it quick).Then people bid on your purchase. You choose the bidder you like and send your bitcoins for the purchase to a multi sig address.Once you get your product you release your coins and give a review of the buyer. Looks good. A lot better than the Alt coin conference I ended up at.It appears that there will actually be Bitcoin stuff being presented. If all you have are apples, that would be pretty useful. I think this is key. Most people think "Wall Street people will be getting into Bitcoin". But the big deal is all of us sitting here with our 401k filled with dollar denominated stocks when we do not have much confidence in the dollar. It is one thing to say you may some day start saving 5% of your savings towards Bitcoin. It is another to take 5% of your $100k+ 401k and move it to the Bitcoin ETF.My 401k already consists mainly of foreign investment funds, that is how much confidence I have in our debt laden dollar. A Bitcoin ETF will be an even better place for some of my retirement. I predict January 2016. What ever happened to that ImNot...something or other. I forgot his name but he used to troll on here a while ago.He was getting paid like 10 cents a post, did his employer fire him for not being a very convincing troll?
"A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a mental or behavioral pattern or anomaly that causes either suffering or an impaired ability to function in ordinary life"Fiat is used to extend and promote wars, which tends to result in suffering. Thus, people who use fiat (behavioral pattern) cause suffering. Thus they are, ipso facto, mentally ill. No matter what a human does.They are still humans.I know it is easier to think of other individuals as less than human. But they are not. They are individuals, they have human emotions just like you. They eat, breath and deal with every day things.Several individuals executed other individuals for their own individual reasons, as humans. Does your petrol station use a card that can be filled online? Or your pharmacy?When I was looking for a car here in Germany I found a car I liked and e-mailed the dealer and said I would buy it today if he would take bitcoins for it. I did get a response but by then I had already decided on another car. I am sure if there are several choices and you tell the dealer you will only pay Bitcoin, they will do what they can to accept it. I'm in Europe and I use http://www.brawker.com and http://www.purse.io for my online purchases.The Bill services are in the US, Canada and Australia...we need one in Europe and Asia now  BitSquare  It is getting to the point where the amount of things you cannot buy with bitcoins is easier to list than what you can buy with bitcoins.Considering that using bitcoins you can buy anything online, you can buy gift cards for most places in the US with bitcoins, what can you not buy with bitcoins?I will create a list and we can mark them off as we go through 2015.Anything on Amazon.  http://www.purse.ioAnything else online. http://www.brawker.com http://coinsfer.com/Bills. https://billpayforcoins.com/ https://bylls.com/ https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.comRestaurants. http://www.gyft.comGroceries. (Your grocery store gift card via http://www.brawker.com if available)Gas. (Your gas card via http://www.brawker.com if available)Income taxes.Car dealerships or houses.? ? ? We are reaching the point where it is easier to list the things you cannot buy with bitcoins than things you can buy with bitcoins.It is a currency, it works as advertised. </QED> Right now if you buy bitoins, you give someone else your dollars and they give you bitcoins. That guy then takes your dollars and spends them, they circulate in the economy and keep the old war money economy going.Jesus said "give unto Caesar what is Caesar's". What would be the closest point where we give our Federal Reserve Notes to the Federal Reserve in exchange for bitcoins?Ideally everyone selling their bitcoins would sell it to pay off any debt that they have. If everyone did that and used Bitcoin for everything else, the banks would have no use for their money, they would not borrow from the Federal Reserve and the FRNs would be useless.Or is it the income tax that is the closest our money goes to the Federal Reserve? If it got to the point that the only time dollars were used was an intermediary exchange that got its dollars from the Federal Reserve and returned those dollars to the Federal Reserve and the rest of the economy was in bitcoins then the dollar would just be a novelty. But, of course, it will not be to that point for a long time. What is is the closest we could come to that though? Two words:Network Effect</QED> I would not spend 50% of my money on something, but once I can buy this with less than 20% of my holdings I will pay the owner bitcoins for it: OP: I think http://maidsafe.net/ will come out just in time. I currently work in Germany but am making sure I visit one new place each month at least while I'm here. I've been to Amsterdam and enjoyed the Netherlands, I would definitely like to visit Arnhem at some point. They estimate the 250k jobs from the amount of VC money that poured into Bitcoin businesses in 2014:"Given that $314 million were invested in various bitcoin related businesses in 2014, it is roughly estimated that these bitcoin investments have created more than 250,000 jobs during 2014 within various sectors related to cryptocurrencies."Original article:http://www.lazynews.tv/did-bitcoin-create-more-jobs-than-the-us-federal-government-did-in-2014/ So you still bump this "BREAKING NEWS" thread from a year ago? About something that never happened... This was actually just about $10 off. They reached it in the UK though. So no business will ever accept bitcoin?Really...?Reallybtw, had a great meal in a Milan pizza place this weekend. Paid for with bitcoin.Paid for the plane ticket to Milan...bitcoin.Car parking at the airport...bitcoin.Tour of the Last Supper....bitcoin.Hotel? Yep, you guessed it. Bitcoin.As for Amazon...I use bitcoin to purchase things on there all the time. It's nicer to save 10-30% for each purchase though so who cares if they don't accept it? Most did not see that thread because OP is a troll and likely on many ignore lists. If I could go back in time I would go some time after the 2008 elections and write up the code for a cryptographic currency, being from the future I would not want my identity figured out and mess with the space time continuum so I would make up a name...something Japanese maybe to throw everyone off. Maybe use British words to make it even more difficult to figure out my identity. First step, dehumanize people. It allows for inhumane things to be done.Worked well for the Nazis.
Bitcoin is already well regulated. This. Is how they want us to react.Please send more money to your masters to fulfill your request (and enslave you more). And CIA funded terrorist attacks.CIA hasn't been made illegal yet. btw...ISIS stole over $400 million from an Iraqi central bank.They can use that much easier than Bitcoin among their non-technical brethren. It probably would only be a blip on the news but there would be about 3 or 4 threads on bitcointalk about it constantly bumped into infinity.And they would find out that the bitcoins weren't actually used in the attack, just that one guy in the organization got some bitcoin donations and that same organization conducted a terrorist attack. The bitcoins used to buy drugs for the opium they bought to get high the night before the attack. We need BitSquare Satoshi is from the future.  2100That is the goal amount of bitcoins I am shooting for.I don't know what I would sell into though...what am I going to hold dollars? Maybe at that point I start buying gold or something. I'd still use bitcoins as a currency though. Having the private key in stores makes it way too prone to abuse. The store manager would go to the card rack only to find they've all been scratched off and the coins gone.A deal between the merchant and company is the way to go, they either have codes corresponding to the bar codes already loaded or they get paid upon sale electronically and are given a code. There's not a lot of up front cost if you don't buy the bitcoins until the actual sale. And it allows for people to buy it at market value at the time of purchase.A receipt with "You have .12312809 bitcoins waiting for you at bitcard.com/IF3392J29LP" Here in Germany you can buy a phone card with a bar code.When you make your purchase a code is printed on your receipt. You then take that code to the online phone website and get credited for the amount.It avoids people stealing the cards. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=883213.0Finding Satoshi Do you use war money to buy sodas?What is the difference between that and not buying bitcoins with that money? This and the 2 other "Bitcoin is used by terrorists!" threads bumped by: MasterCasino, BigGameCAsino, JohnsCasino (see any resemblance?). This and the 2 other "Bitcoin is used by terrorists!" threads bumped by: MasterCasino, BigGameCAsino, JohnsCasino (see any resemblance?), all started and bumped by Dondie. I spend it all the time. Anything you want online you can buy with bitcoins.This weekend I'll be taking a trip to Milan and plan on visiting a nice pizza place that takes bitcoins. This and the 2 other "Bitcoin is used by terrorists!" threads bumped by: MasterCasino, BigGameCAsino, JohnsCasino (see any resemblance?), all started and bumped by Dondie. If you have bitcoins...do you ever buy anything online?Do you like getting discounts when buying things online?Why sell when you can just spend it at brawker.com or purse.io and save money? You can get bitcoins via paypal through brawker.com It's been a day and I have received no free coins.Is this the type of person we need in our 'community'? Promising free coins and then not following through. 
Well, they're in cold storage so it wouldn't be worth the effort to get them out, download the wallet, wait for it to load up and import, move to the exchange, etc...If they're worth anything maybe I'll pull them out. I just wanted to own 1000 of a crypto currency since I wasn't able to do it with Bitcoin   Greece comes down to one thing.In 2005 their debt/GDP ratio went over 100%, within 4 years their economy was in a freefall. By 2010 they got bailed out by the EU but the debt/GDP is still over 100%. Not much you can do until that is fixed (or they go bankrupt which is more likely).Btw...the US debt/GDP ration went over 100% this year... Even though I have 1000 PPC from years ago I keep meaning to get rid of them. I did not check them out enough before I bought them to see that there is no hard limit on the amount of coins. The logic:My bitcoins yesterday < my bitcoins today = richer Bitcoins man...they keep getting cheaper and I keep getting richer. Thanks, I just used the site for the first time and was pleased.  I calculated it back in 2011 when MtGox released their numbers and it was easier to calculate from a single exchange. It might not be the same number now but I don't see it being much higher (back then about the only thing you could do with Bitcoin was hold it or trade it on the exchange. They also treat Bitcoin as a currency. Which comes with complications. Imagine for a moment that those 20,000 people are paid on a weekly basis. Half are paid on Friday night, half are paid on Wednesday morning.Now imagine that on average it took a half a week for people to spend all of their bitcoins. For simplicity, they spend all of their bitcoins a half week after they get paid.So the Friday night employees spend all of their bitcoins on Wednesday morning and the Wednesday morning people spend all of their bitcoins on Friday night.This would mean that at any time, half of the 20,000 people have all of the bitcoins they were paid.This is the equivalent of 10,000 people holding bitcoins. Or 20,000 people having half of their bitcoins.This would be $500 million worth of bitcoins at today's prices.From my own experience getting paid in bitcoins I tend to wait to buy/pay for things until the price goes up. I don't buy things right when I get paid. And I make a lot more than the household income in the US so it would not necessarily need to be 20,000.But if you say that people will be paying for things with bitcoins that are converted to war money...then there would have to exist a market that accepts bitcoins. The more places that accept bitcoins, the more people will be willing to get paid in bitcoins. The more bitcoins will be held and not immediately converted to war money. The closer that number of bitcoins held gets to 14 million...the higher the value of each bitcoin. Umm...there are no words...People honestly believe that if euro or dollar did not exist we would all be trying to figure out what someone's salary is in Bitcoin?Just like how we price gold in dollars...if there were no dollars then the price of gold would be unknown, people standing around with gold coins dumbstruck as to what its value is. Can it buy a piece of candy, a house, pay for a whole country? Who knows...there are no dollars to price it in. Is that about how it would work?     Imagine if, when the Internet came out, people just bought all of the domain names and held them without doing anything with them*. They knew the Internet would be successful so they figured they'd just buy domains and wait.Imagine if everyone did that.All waiting for someone else to make the Internet useful.*(I know there are domain squatters)You're not cheap...just useless. It would be an expensive lesson on "protect your private keys". I don't mind one bit staying in this $200 to $220 range, it is building a solid foundation. The only wavering have been jumps upward before coming back down. That tells me the direction it will be heading. Or, like the last hard fork, the price jumps up because everyone's confidence in how resilient Bitcoin is is boosted. You should PM it to me to see how trustworthy I am first. Bitcoin will just be over $1,000 by then.A hundred thousandaire. You know someone is completely sane when they spell it: CrAzY What community are you talking about? There is no community, just a lot of individuals with their own thoughts and ideals who happen to share an interest in Bitcoin. Exactly, I don't have a few million dollars to manipulate the price for a profit. So I just get paid in Bitcoin and spend it. Ahh, I did not notice that. I will be waiting too.
They will find out quickly that the charge backs on that currency are insane. Considering I have a US bank account and German bank account I wonder how much easier it will be to move dollars to euros and back using Coinbase.If it is easy and cheaper than current bank transfers, a lot of people in my office will probably start using it. Very nice, I will definitely see if their rate is better than AnxPro. I would imagine they'd roll them out in the stores that have a kiosk that allow you to order on a touch screen. That is just a matter of using BitPay and tweaking a few lines of code. During college, as a computer science major...there would be maybe 2 girls in the class of 30-50 guys. One asian and one ugly but with a boyfriend. Hold on now, if you're from the future who's the president? Since many of his posts were probably deleted for the page 10,000 deletes (maybe off on holidays?) he likely averages 20 posts per day, which is 10 war dollars per day.Not a bad racket, it requires absolutely no mental ability whatsoever from the looks of it so hey...free money. This is some seriously bullishness coming from a troll. Acknowledging Bitcoin usefulness.He has come so far. well at least it acknowledges Bitcoin's relevance when you could hardly buy anything with Bitcoinnow that you can live on bitcoin it must be even more so Don't be surprised if you get burned.Never sell bitcoins for a transaction that can be reversed. PayPal allows someone 180 days to reverse a transaction. Looks to be gone. Thanks. trolltards gonna troll Assuming posting 7 days a week, every day of the year...19 posts per day.And not a single one of them in any way useful to anyone. Your activity is 420.That is all I want to add. Ya, I think it will start out as an option for a percentage of paychecks. The way bitwage does it is through the payroll companies so it is simpler for the companies to provide that option. Gyft is good too. 3% or 30%...other people are losing money using their war money for those services instead of bitcoin. It is simple, it is how I am paid. Taxes are taken out before my paycheck is sent to me. No judicial disputes, I get paid my usual pay...just in bitcoins.This is already happening. Do you work in the US and get direct deposit? So if war money did not exist and all we had were bitcoins....how do you think they would calculate pay?  Do you ever use Amazon? Do you like losing money that you could be saving by using purse.io?
This thread is also a good demonstration of the fact that people only read headlines and ignore every post in the thread before posting something in that thread. I think any industry with a billion in revenue per year is something the market will respond to and service. The price would need to rise 6 times to accommodate the demand.Yes, most merchants do tend to convert immediately to war money but unless you immediately spend all of your money, you will probably take the length of your pay period to spend the money which means that on average you are holding bitcoins for half of the pay period. Over the course of the year you have held bitcoins for half a year on average. This still equals have a billion in bitcoins every year. That more than covers mining costs.Which means more adoption, more people paid in bitcoins and more spending. No matter if merchants keep it in bitcoins or not, that steady stream incoming will make up for any conversion by the merchants.Only about 1/6th of all bitcoins is traded on the exchanges. So those 20,000 would be sucking out over 220 bitcoins each (at current prices) while only 110 bitcoins per household would be available on the exchange. Accounting for only holding half of the time means that those 20k households would be buying every bitcoin on the exchange at current volume and current prices. That's not counting other investors. If Bitcoin took over, the Fed could print an $18 trillion bill and pay off the debt and none of us would be affected (except those that have treasury bonds in war money). The economy would continue in bitcoins without a huge war money debt hanging over our heads.Countries would not be able to print money to go to war, they would have to spend only what they have so the wars would turn into small skirmishes. Ahh, so you use the phone line for Internet?I'm just saying, most people just use their cell phone as the main line. You could just unplug it. Once we reach 20k households getting paid in bitcoin I believe at that point we will have reached mass adoption.20,000 households in the US at an average household income of $50,000 would be $1 billion each year flowing into Bitcoin. And that's just the United States. Current mining cost is $300 million and next year it will be $150 million per year. To match that there would only need to be 3,000 households.I could see us getting to 1,000 people using bitwage.co by the end of the year (at least getting a percentage of their checks in bitcoin). 3,000 easily by the end of next year.As someone that gets paid 100% in Bitcoin I compare it to the day I decided to drop my home phone and live off of just my cell phone in the late 90s when it was not quite ready to do yet. I had to make some adjustments and "cheated" a little by using my office phone and needing to wait until after 7PM to make calls on my cell phone and little things like that, but it was possible. The same with using bitcoin as my primary currency, I have to "cheat" by selling some at localbitcoins to pay for local things and narrow down my selection of websites I use but it is possible. And, like my cell phone, it will get better and easier to the point that everyone will eventually do it and just like those people with land lines, they will be in the minority or have niche reasons for doing so.Do you think we will reach 20k households getting paid in bitcoin? What is stopping you from trying it out with something small like 5% of your salary? I already use cheapair.com for my flights paying with bitcoins but it sounds like this will allow for many other ways of paying and will give bonus miles for using bitcoins. Prescott benefited off of the alcohol prohibition much like drug dealers benefit from drug prohibition.If you think a drug dealer is a hero then so was Prescott Bush. Curious...why do you still have a land line? OpenBazaar will make that point moot. I finally got my euro order through so now I can stop being such the bear I have been the past few weeks. Just looked at a few people's trust scores. Looks like it is made for giving people good or bad ratings if you like them or not.I don't use it and don't plan on trading with anyone on here so no big deal. I'm sure I'll say or do things that will offend people but don't plan on begging them to change their mind. They are free to disagree. Getting 10-30% off of your purchase should motivate anyone to switch to spending bitcoins online even if they don't like Bitcoin. Most things I would want to buy are available on Amazon. Everything else online you can get a discount through brawker.comA lot of people go to retailmenot to get a $5 coupon before purchasing something. Putting your order on a site like purse.io or brawker isn't much more difficult. Ya, I was trying to see if I could make one troll free thread in Speculation. It ended up being too much work deleting endless sock puppet troll posts. Well if Bernie Sanders says it's right then it must be. Where do I make the check out to? He'll probably be pissed when he gets home and sees flour and food prints all over his keyboard from the bitch leaving the kitchen to post on reddit.  I did see this: https://billpayforcoins.com/A Bitcoin Bill Pay service but I think their 3% fee is a bit steep. But it might be useful for someone.Update on this site: Interesting.Meh, no big deal. Even if Greece leaves the EU it won't be an immediate domino affect, it's not like other countries will see it the next day and decide to leave. They will have to go through their own government procedures and votes and all of that. The confidence in the Euro will take a hit though. I keep looking up at the date of the OP and am baffled that the thread is from 2015, I was thinking it was 2014 or 2013 asking if anyone is using Bitcoin for every day purchases.I get paid in Bitcoin and use it all the time. If you buy something online there's no reason you should be pulling out a credit card if you have bitcoins.Here are some useful day to day sites for spending bitcoins.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0 I deleted someone's off topic post in a self-moderated thread and he gives me a negative trust rating. Isn't that rating for people who exchange goods or something?
Homeland Security is just yet another task force for the Drug War. The people working there now will just move to the DEA. Yes, trust is an issue for OpenBazaar too. They are working to address that with a decentralized WoT type of setup.The guy with the 1000 iPhones would likely either be paid per shipment (a handling fee) or get a cut from the retailer of each sale. The investors do the least amount of work but get the most reward precisely because of that risk. The lower the risk, the lower the return, and the distributor would likely get more money for lowering that risk.It would be great if distribution was wide enough and organic enough that you could have next day delivery from source to the door for many things including food from the farm. Every decade has its radicals. We had no department of Homeland Security less than 20 years ago. It will not be missed. That was early December when that happened.They were hoping to have it back up in January but it looks like it will not return. The worst that could happen is they disappear in that brief window from when I get paid and they send my bitcoins. If that happened then I'd be able to have my company reverse the transaction.But that window is very small. A matter of hours. It is better than an exchange because once they have my money it is immediately converted to bitcoins, sent to an address in my cold storage. I live in Germany, where localbitcoins is banned. Before it was banned I was getting almost too many people wanting to buy bitcoins because it's so hard to get them here. I charged 10% and that was undercutting other sellers so much that people were driving hours to buy from me.Now that they shut down access in Germany I have 3 or 4 people that I traded with before that contact me, usually just a bitcoin each time they get paid which is enough for me to pay my rent and some spending money. I actually prefer this because I did not want to start turning people down for trades and risk my localbitcoins reputation but I was getting too cash heavy and am not comfortable dropping more than 10k euros in my bank account. I meant to use it as a way to get cash for bitcoins, not turn it into a business.

Yes, I tried this yesterday. They ask you to pay when you arrive. http://www.ibtimes.com/free-mcdonalds-how-win-pay-lovin-currency-1803124The currency was "Lovin".Yet Another Alt Coin (YAAC) Or it allows people to go from casual holders to active Bitcoin currency users. I could still provide a credit card when I arrive like I do with some hotels to cover any overages.Hopefully my AnxPro bitcoin debit card arrives this week then. As long as someone has more power than you or your group, they can control your life. That includes making you give them money.If you sit down in a park and open a bottle of wine a man with a hat and a gun might come up to you and say you are not allowed to drink that there. Fortunately you have a gun so the two of you are of equal power...but he gets on his radio and calls his friends who also have guns. You have some friends with guns too and you call them and they come to protect you. They see this and they call some guys in big trucks and riot gear. You call your militia buddies who are trained for this type of thing. They call friends with helicopters and tanks. And on and on it goes, them bringing out jets that you have no response to.Which gives that man with the hat more power than you sitting in a park. So you have to do whatever he says.Survival of the fittest. Everything else "government" and procedure and elections are just a show to make it easier to take more power from people without them resisting. In an anarchist world people would still be able to combine their power, use that power to control others and the group with the most power can control the most people and influence other groups of power.Call it government or not, it is the same thing. Expedia only does hotels, btctrip only does flights and hotels, CheapAir does flights, hotels and car rentals but when I went to book a car rental it said I must pay when I get there. Paying with a credit card when traveling is chalk full of fees I would rather not pay. Are there any other options for paying with Bitcoin? Meh, we live in an anarchist world already.The "governments" just prove the power of the fittest theory. They have the most power so they have the most control. So it was the vaccine that brought the numbers down?Cool story bro. Of those 100 people affected by Measles in the news, how many died?Could it be that our sanitary hospitals and better medical practices have surpassed the need for injecting poisons into babies?  And how many deaths from Measles in the US in the past decade?How many deaths from the Measles vaccine in the US over that same time?
This. The others had a big target on their backs and could be taken down. And were.Why did Napster fail while Bittorrent has not? You can now vote securely, anonymously and transparently using the system setup on BitPools.But it is not set up for today's government elections. Wasting time on that would be like Satoshi creating Bitcoin to make it easier for banks to transfer fiat amongst themselves. No, I am not from the television. It looks like OpenBazaar is on the right path as a decentralized retailer. But could it be used for decentralized distribution?Say someone has a big empty garage/basement and some free time. They could put an advertisement out as a distribution for a certain sized order and charge a fixed amount for handling.This way you might have some investor that's willing to buy 1000 cell phones at $100 each wholesale, they have the boxes of cell phones shipped to the distributor and a retailer on OpenBazaar sells them for $200 each. If they each take a 33% cut, they make $33k each. There would just need to be a mechanism for distributing the funds for each sale.You could even use BitPools for the investors, have 100 people invest $1000 each into this and get $1333 return once all are sold.And no I'm not talking about distributing illegal items, people would know in advance what they are distributing.I know plenty of people that would love a work from home job and this would be a pretty simple way of doing that. You could even have multiple distributors and ship from each based on location and shipping costs. Even having a distribution to distributors to the point that you have a distributor in every city, then you could provide same day delivery. Maybe even have a decentralized method of delivery, someone with a truck willing to go between two cities on a regular basis with cargo. Mind you, some believe that Mechanical Turk is exploiting workers considering it usually pays below minimum wage. But people in foreign countries take advantage of it because a few bucks a day is worth it. And to convert it to bitcoins on purse.io will take a significant cut. Again, something someone in a poor country does not mind.But I heard that the transcribing tasks pay the best which would be easier for an english speaking person.

This idea that people new to Bitcoin should hold it instead of spending it is strange. Do we not want Bitcoin to catch on and have people learn to use it so they see the advantage of having and spending bitcoins?Or is the price the only thing that matters for Bitcoin? http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/cryptocurrency-round-ibm-samsung-develop-blockchain-technology-facebook-tipping-1484019 I'd be curious to know if anyone else has set themselves up on bitwage.co even for 5-10% of their pay.I hope they are successful and get 10,000 people to do the same.10k people making on average $50k per year would be $500 million coming into Bitcoin each year. That more than makes up for the current mining costs of $300 million per year (until it halves next year). Ya, those batteries can take such a beating though she had to put some work into getting it, you can't just open the top and poor it out, that's water. I could see if it was hydrochloric acid since people have that in barrels if they have a pool. I was given several free cans of chew on spring break. And gum and video game samplers. Battery acid does not seem like something easy to obtain. That's one crazy bitch.Even though he can't have sex anymore at least he has a taped memory of when he could. And do I have to be the first to say "video or it didn't happen"? Dude, don't even joke about Miley Cyrus. That shit is real. What planet do you live on?As I suspected...Aliens I would say it was unlawful restraint as opposed to kidnapping.Here is a definition (Texas) of kidnapping:KIDNAPPING. (a) A person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly abducts another person.(b) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that:(1) the abduction was not coupled with intent to use or to threaten to use deadly force;(2) the actor was a relative of the person abducted; and(3) the actor's sole intent was to assume lawful control of the victim.When I was in high school there was a knock on the door, my mom said it was for me so I go to the door. Two big guys from my high school grab me and drag me to a van and throw me in. All while my mom and sisters watched. I get in the van and see another girl from our church. It was a kidnapping church retreat for the day. They told her in advance so she knew what was coming and made sure I was home at that time. That was an abduction by someone who was not a family member. But their sole intent was not to assume lawful control over me. And I didn't really fight back since I knew the guys from church and my mom was just watching like everything was ok.I also remember seeing an old episode of Gidget where her friends kidnapped her and took her to a kidnapping party.  Back in October we had Ebola shoved down our throats with the 24 hour scare networks making everyone believe they would catch Ebola if they went outside.Now they're doing the same thing with Measles.I'm thinking that they had some vaccine ready to give out and were using the Ebola thing to scare people into getting it but something must have happened to make that batch not work.So, maybe they have it working now and instead of pulling up Ebola again since people didn't fall for it, they're pulling out Measles which as the "expert" on TV said the other day is so much worse than Ebola (even though nobody has died from Measles in the past 20 years while 100 people have died from the Measles vaccine).Thoughts? Are they putting something in the vaccines? Just a money making scheme? The credit card companies were giving away free stuff all the time.Here's a free candy bar, all you have to do is sign up! I have 5000 euro on a small European exchange. The current price is 195 euro. If I were to buy bitcoins with those 5000 euro I would drive the price up to 210 euro. This is what causes price swings.If, however, people were going short and long on margin my measly 5000 euro wouldn't make a dent.
You can borrow 50:1 already. Maybe we should have guys with guns in every city that oversee every Bitcoin trade controlled by a central entity to make the rules of how bitcoins can be traded.That would be ideal. Maybe then we would have a useful currency.And if someone tries to make a trade that doesn't follow the rules...shoot them in the face.  Amazon Mechanical Turk -> Amazon points -> purse.io -> Bitcoin One blockchain for currency is ideal.If you want other blockchains, there are plenty. They are called alts.I like Bitcoin for the BitPools voting because it is the most secure protocol in the world. That is kinda handy for voting.

Even with this, Somalia is better off now than when they had a government. http://www.coindesk.com/ingenico-adds-bitcoin-option-to-pos-terminals/So this news came out a few weeks ago but I have not heard much about it since then. From the article it appears that Ingenico terminals use some software and they allow "apps" on their terminals.Would this mean that a merchant in Europe using an Ingenico terminal can just install this Paymium app to accept bitcoins? Or does it install automatically? I will keep an eye out for any of these terminals to see if it has options on there for payment.Is there a site that will show us which merchants are using this app? I'm not sure what the country is used for.As long as you can get Amazon to ship to you, someone else can get Amazon to ship to you.I had problems getting them to ship me a cell phone to an APO address but many Amazon merchants for that phone did not ship to me. But other things went through fine. Ya, they change the UI sometimes. As long as it works.Does Amazon ship to you? That should be all that matters. And the strange numbers?A human would type 1.8 and 193.4 or whichever So is it mainly bots trading on these exchanges?I just bought a lot of bitcoins at just over 193.4 euro in 1.8 bitcoin increments.I have been waiting for something under 194 and saw that pop up so I bought it.Then a few seconds later another 1.8 popped up for close to the same price. So I bought it again. And it popped up about 6 more times and I snatched it up each time.But the numbers were different each time. 1.79871374  193.310981.79279944  193.42050etc...numbers like thatwhat's that all about? I'm glad someone did that, if I were to buy that many bitcoins at the current volume I would have driven the price up to 200 euro.  You have bitcoins? You're half way there.Do you like to save money on things you buy?Use http://www.purse.ioThen wonder why your friends pay full price for things using their fiat money.

The guy, Abu Mustafa who allegedly posted a Bitcoin address on some ISIS forum was a prisoner in Abu Ghraib.http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/12/abu-ghraib-remains-scar-on-u-s-war-efforts/So maybe the story should be that the US horrible treatment of Iraqi prisoners has caused them to join ISIS.Maybe the anti-Bitcoin reporters would like to report the anti-war story about how our attacks actually turn people into enemies.
Check localbitcoins. Yes, as the OpenBazaar paper says, this is the main thing that needs to be addressed:"In decentralized systems, Sybil attacks [Douceur] make this situation particularly more challenging and without an easy way to resolve."They go into a lot of different options to address it including proof of burn.

So...you want to drive up the price of nuclear armaments which would be followed by an increase of supply to fulfill the demand? Well, as miners are paid more and more and use more electricity it could get to the point where infrastructure is created to pay for mining and our daily electricity will just be an overflow of what they're not using. Whole communities that have major mining farms could get cheap electricity from the remaining output. Even Ron Paul's plan of cutting a whole lot of spending including ending the wars and bringing all the soldiers home would only balance the budget after 4 years and begin paying off the debt during his second term.If we wanted to pay off the debt in 30 years it would cost at least an extra $800 billion per year.

Wrighthttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=309409.0Bye bye bitcoinThat last one was October 11, 2013...Bitcoin price was $125 The docs I found are on their GitHub page. Here is one about the web of trust: https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/blob/develop/docs/02%20Web%20of%20Trust.mdAs for BitSquare's centralization. I do see that they have 10 arbitrators that are queried upon a problem with an arbitrator. But they are not a static 10, they are the 10 highest rated arbitrators and that could change daily. If they abuse their power, their rating goes down and they are no longer the top 10.That is why the rating solution should be solid and decentralized. So that there cannot be abuses of the ratings in order to try to get to the top 10. And even if you reach that top 10, people choose from among those 10 to resolve disputes with their arbitrator. If the arbitrator is found to be in the wrong then they lose some of their initial deposited funds. I only read the OpenBazaar paper on it. It looked quite decentralized. I need to read more on the BitSquare setup. Bitcoin is not a community, it is a currency. It is math.If you were looking for something more from math like companionship you are not getting in the real world, you are in the wrong place.Maybe you should go to a liberal community like moveon or huffingtonpost where people will give you kudos or pats on the back. Or stick with Facebook and accumulate many 'Likes'. They will be worth a lot some day. Even if the price goes down to $1, having more options for spending your bitcoins is always good news.At least for people that actually use bitcoin as a currency instead of those people holding bitcoins hoping that other people actually use it as a currency. But the arbitrator is decentralized. Anyone can become an arbitrator, all they are doing is confirming a transaction just like a mining computer would confirm a transaction. Actually, if I have something that can wait I do not buy it with bitcoins until the price is higher than what I was paid that last paycheck.My last paycheck came in at $230. I am planning a trip to Milan so I bought my plane tickets using Bitcoin when the price was as $235 (coming down from $240). Now I need to book a hotel but the price is below $230 (currently $225) so I can wait until either the price is back above $230 or I get paid again.Unless I have a pressing bill, spending this way will always have me spending when the price is higher than what I was paid. And if the price jumps up a lot, I buy things I've been putting off for a while. So, get paid directly with bitcoin using http://www.bitwage.coOr even a percentage of your pay. Just as Bitcoin was above the linear trend line, it is below it now. Great time to be buying bitcoins. Over $300 yet?Hmm, nope.Hold.

From reading up on OpenBazaar and BitSquare they are both using arbitrators and are trying to come up with their own way of rating users (akin to an e-bay rating for a transaction).From the options I saw that OpenBazaar is taking they do not look very promising with the frontrunner being burning bitcoins to rate someone. BitSquare allows for a third party rating system which would be good if they could tie it into OpenBazaar.I think the solution would be to have mediators that are paid to resolve conflicts in ratings, similar to arbitrators resolving a payment dispute.You could do a multi-sig sort of transaction for rating. If all goes well, person A rates his transaction with person B, person B accepts and the rating is fulfilled.If there is disagreement, the mediator is person C and can side with person A or person B.By using a sidechain, the rating can be stored in a side blockchain designed specifically for rating people while still having the value of Bitcoin backing it.And there should be more than just ratings of a person of 1 to 10 or 1 to 5 or whichever. Someone might be great at buying items but when they go to sell they are scammers. Or an arbitrator might be good at buying or selling but make piss poor decisions when arbitrating.This is just an observation as someone who has not worked on either of these projects so it may have already come up.What are your thoughts on this?

I would rather use Bitcoin as a currency. The low price right now is actually pretty great. But that was the next sentence. Gavin used the word 'fail' within two words of Bitcoin....TWO WORDS!!!

I realize it is just starting out so they need to charge more but with competition and more use I'm sure the price will come down.They may want to check out MyCheckFree who offers free bill pay services (in fiat).From their site: That's a good question. I have not been able to find whether the source of Japan and China lending is the government or foreign investors in those countries.  Japan's economy is so screwed up though who knows what they're doing. The volatility actually helps in the long run.I get paid once every 2 weeks. If the price drops during that time I cut back on my spending. If the price goes up I spend more (pay my monthly bills, pay for trips I'm planning, buy something online I'd had my eye on).Over time, doing this is better than just dollar cost averaging.(I just wish I was at home to pay my hosting service when the price jumped up over $300, by the time I got home from a long flight the price was back down)The price is up over the $231 rate I was paid on Friday so I will probably plan my Valentine's weekend trip today.

If I'm in Michigan and get pulled over the cop can ask for my license I can present my Florida drivers license. I am a licensed driver.Coinbase is licensed. I am sure they can prove it easily, they just have to prove it for one state.Their website showed that you can use the exchange in California because they fulfilled all requirements for that state (which does not require a license).Everyone knows that the licensing requirements are different for each state. That is why there is no US Bitcoin exchange. They can act as money transmitters by registering with FinCen but need to meet the various laws of each state.Either way. I will leave this to the lawyers that thrive quite well in the US, especially in California where you can just get your law degree online. I'm glad I no longer live there and would never think to set up a business there. Something they never announced. And since California does not require a license to exchange bitcoins, there is no license to acquire.Even the California "warning" said Coinbase didn't have a license, and they are considering what such a license would look like were it to exist...which it doesn't.I didn't get a license to buy soda this morning at the store. Now, just because I say that does not mean I am licensed to buy soda at the store. And if I say that my drivers license allows me to buy any drink in the store including alcohol, it does not mean I need a license to buy soda as well.The store owner putting out a press release stating that I "do not have a license to buy soda" at the store does not change one bit that I can buy soda at the store.And I can see why you would rather settle out of court. The mere threat of a lawsuit is always good for a few bucks from a company trying to hold a good reputation that has a bit of money. No, I doubt it is any government conspiracy. More than likely people who's livelihood relies on the current financial system and see Bitcoin as a threat.If Apple had a web forum you'd probably see Micro$oft people on there trolling all the time, even from work being encouraged by their co-workers to do so and tolerated by management. Why do you need it to be seen as a viable currency? If you can spend it now, why worry about how others see it? If you hold the value of 3 internets you are the richest person in the world. I agree, and I would love to have gold at that time. But Bitcoin is much easier to use in such a situation. Thanks. I'll have to keep that in mind if that ever comes up again.

Post here if you have some useful sites for every day Bitcoin spending (not obscure "you can buy knitting needles at this place online" links).http://www.purse.iohttp://www.bitwa.lahttp://www.cheapair.comhttp://www.expedia.comhttp://www.steampowered.comhttp://www.localbitcoins.comhttp://www.gyft.comhttp://www.egifter.comhttp://www.anxpro.comhttp://www.bitronictech.nethttp://www.takeaway.comhttp://www.bit-x.comhttp://www.bitrefill.comhttp://www.billpayforcoins.com DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!Purse.ioI love this site when I need to buy most things online. If you can buy it on Amazon.com you can use purse.io. Purse.io allows you to buy anything on Amazon and get around 8% to 30% off, every time. Even if you don't use Bitcoin for anything else, it is a no brainer if you are going to buy something on Amazon to use purse.io.How can they give such big discounts? Amazon has this thing called Mechanical Turk, people all over the world can do simple tasks that computers cannot yet do and get paid a small wage. People in poor countries will do this and make a few dollars a day. But they get paid in Amazon points. It takes months for them to get those points turned into their local currency.Purse.io allows people to buy your Amazon order for you and they get paid when the shipment arrives. If you're worried about people using stolen credit cards or anything for the purchse, Purse.io has a $10,000 guarantee that they will put toward any problem with your order.BitwalaPay your bills with bitcoins in Europe. It allows you to make a SEPA transfer paying with bitcoins and the recipient receives the payment in euros. They charge .5% for the payment and the exchange rate they use is close to the EUR/BTC rate on most exchanges. You can send up to 200 euro per month, 500 with a simple e-mail verification and 2000 euro with utility bill scan and passport scan. I used it to pay 500 euro of my rent and am waiting on verification of my documents to pay the rest. I will also be able to use this to pay the many speeding tickets that the cameras like to send me. Cheap AirI use this site all the time for booking my flights. I have compared the prices to other sites and their price is usually within one or two dollars of the cheapest site. It's easy, convenient and you can pay with bitcoins. One cool feature they have is that if your fare drops any time after you buy the tickets before your flight, they will give you a voucher for the difference (up to $100). I used it once and was quite pleased.Expedia HotelsThough I do like using airBnB for some of my stays, they do not accept Bitcoin so I tend to go with Expedia. You can book a hotel room and pay with bitcoins. There are some hotels that do not have Bitcoin as an option (I'm not sure why) but about 90% do accept it. I've built up gold status on there and while it gives me a few perks on hotels it is not as good as some hotel reward programs that I have used (like Holiday Inn and Marriot rewards programs). But I did get a $150 coupon for a hotel stay by reaching that status and some hotels have VIP status that gives me stuff like a free bottle of wine or candy in my room.SteamHaven't used this myself yet but it appears to be working well for people to top up their steam accounts using bitcoins. You can't pay exactly for the game, you choose your amounts (like a gift card) but it should get you close enough. Great place to buy video games.LocalBitcoinsThis is very useful for me, my paycheck is in dollars converted to bitcoins through BitWage but I live in Germany where they spend euros. By selling my bitcoins on localbitcoins I am able to have some cash to pay for local things like food and restaurants. LocalBitcoins is actually banned in Germany but I still talk to one or two guys that are willing to trade so I have enough spending money for rent and food.GyftI used this site to buy an eBay gift card. It was pretty easy to sign up and buy a card with bitcoins. Right after I bought the card I received the coupon code. I then went onto eBay and plugged in the code and got the discount (the site says to wait up to 4 hours but it took it right away). On eBay I still had to "pay" the $0 charge with PayPal but that was just a matter of signing in and accepting the $0 fee. Everything beyond that was just like buying something on eBay. For that card I could only choose $5 increments up to $50, then the increments increased. I actually chose an item based on the fact that it was $43.97 instead of a more expensive version over $60 because of this. I received some "points" for using bitcoins which I assume will go toward a discount on a future purchase. I believe it is 3% back for bitcoin purchases.Gyft and Egifter have around 100 or so businesses they sell gift cards for from Home Depot to Applebees, Chilis, Lowes, Amazon, TJ Maxx, Burger King and on and on...if I was in the US I would use this a lot.EgifterEgifter is similar to Gyft but I was able to buy an eBay gift card in $1 increments, I purchased a gift code for $95. With this one it took a few hours before I could use the code on eBay but it worked the same as Gyft taking the purchase price to $0 before asking me to pay with my PayPal account. Gyft and Egifter appear to have about the same amount of stores, they could be off by a few I'm sure. Egifter gave me some points, more than Gyft but I have not explored how to use them yet.BitWageIf you are working in the US and you get your salary direct deposited you should try this site. They work with payroll companies to convert your paycheck to bitcoins. Most companies allow you to break your paycheck into multiple direct deposit accounts with a percentage in each account. I suggest you try the site and at least do 5-10% of your paycheck converted to bitcoin to see how convenient it is and useful for having bitcoins to spend.ANXProANXPro is an exchange but they offer a debit card that you can fund with bitcoins. I received my card and am a bit disappointed by the charging cost and the delay. When I received and activated my card I went to the site and chose the option to fund my card with bitcoins. The site converts your bitcoins to dollars, the bitcoin dollar price when I went to charge the card was about $246. They charged the card at a rate of $235/BTC. So they are basically taking 5% to charge the card. So then I went to the store and tried to use it and it was declined. It was not until about 3 days later that I received an e-mail that said that my card had been funded. So as of right now, though they offer a solution, I do not see it as very useful. I would rather not lose 5% in purchasing value, and needing to charge the card several days in advance means I am not really converting my bitcoins to pay for a purchase, but instead just converting my bitcoins to dollars and funding a debit card (which could likely be done quicker and cheaper another way).Bitronic TechI use this site for my hosting service. They have good rates, they do a lot of different hosting configurations giving you a Linux server of whatever variety you might want. I like that I can pay their monthly bill in bitcoins because throughout the month if the price goes up a lot I just pay my monthly hosting bill before the price settles down. And the fact that I pay in bitcoins means I can drop them at any time (just by not paying) and they won't keep charging my card until I jump through hoops on the phone to get them to drop me.Takeaway.comTakeaway.com is a great website for finding a local restaurant (mainly pizza) that delivers or offers take-out. You give them your zip code and it gives you a list of all of the restaurants in the area they support. It has reviews of each restaurant and the minimum required purchase for delivery. It even has a good timer to show if it is open or how long from right now it will be open. When you click on a restaurant it gives you a simple menu to choose from. You choose your food just like you would buy anything else online, putting it into your cart. When you check out you give your address and phone number which you can create an account to save for you. Then you just choose payment in bitcoin and send your bitcoins. Very simple. I ordered a hamburger and some dessert last night from a local burger place. Everything went smoothy, I received an e-mail when my bitcoins were received and one acknowledging that the restaurant was working on my order. I'm in Germany so I was redirected to www.lieferando.de but they have sites all over the world doing the same thing. My order went well, I won't critique the meal because that has nothing to do with the site. But I like that I can buy food with bitcoins. Update: used this a second time, for both orders I tried to add a message to the "remarks" box and both times the remarks were ignored (no onions on pizza, etc), just an FYI.Bit-xBit-x is a debit card where you load bitcoins and upon purchase with the card the charge is converted to the currency used by the merchant. As of right now I only used it for one purchase so I will go by that. When setting up the card you choose the currency you want the card denominated in. Being in Europe I chose euros. I have not yet used the card in europe but when I was in the US I was at a restaurant that did not accept cash so I pulled out this card hoping it would work. Surprisingly it did even though I forgot the PIN (used it as a credit card). From a quick glance at the balance the card converted my total from bitcoins to euros to dollars. The euro/dollar conversion looked legit (not an outrageous conversion rate) but I did not check for exact numbers so I'm not sure if they add an exchange rate per purchase. I will likely start using it more and check the numbers for rates. But all around it is a decent card and works as advertised.BitrefillThe phone plan I use uses prepaid cards. My carrier is 02 but this site covers dozens of prepaid phone choices. It conveniently just asks for your phone number then finds your carrier for you. Then you provide your email address and choose the card amount you want to buy. Simple QR payment and 10 minutes or so later your phone is topped up. I used to have to go to the store, buy the card, get the number on the receipt then go home and go the the 02 website to give the card number and wait for the phone to top up. This so much easier.BillPay For CoinsThis is a bill pay website where you enter the address of your payee and they send the payment for you. I am still in the process of trying my first payment, I will give more information on how it goes. The current fee is 1.99%DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!Suggested websites in the thread:http://cardflip.com - huge discounts on some gift cards, plus 3% more with bitcoinhttp://egifter.com - similar to gyfthttp://whollyhemp.com - soap and other productshttp://inyfootprintcoffe.com - coffeehttp://bitbrew.net/ - coffeehttp://www.bitcoinshop.us - several itemshttp://bitstickers.net - stickershttp://allthingsluxury.biz/ - luxury goodshttps://www.namecheap.com/ - hosting servicehttp://www.9flats.com - rooms for nightly renthttp://www.newegg.com/ - computer stuffhttp://www.tigerdirect.com/ - computer stuffhttp://www.dell.com/ - computershttp://www.microsoftstore.com/ - microsoft productshttp://www.overstock.com/ - online storehttp://www.rakuten.com - online storehttp://www.pexpeppers.com - hot sauce and honeyhttp://www.cryptosextoys.com - sex toysCanada:https://bylls.com/ - pay your billsPhillipines:http://rebit.phhttp://bills.ninjahttp://mobileshop.ph - top up your phonehttp://piiko.com - top up your phone What? No. Anything you want to buy online can be done with Bitcoin now.I could care less if Bitcoin goes mainstream. I actually welcome people to stay with their fiat, I have told my family and people that I care about how to buy bitcoins and continue to do that for them (I wish they had listened to me at $17/BTC). But the same losers that vote for Obama and Romney. The same people that have destroyed the US. They get what they deserve and they deserve to be late to Bitcoin.If Bitcoin usefulness as a currency was frozen to its current use, it would still be 10x more useful than fiat. But I know there are thousands of people out there working to advance it.Right now it can be used to pay for anything online, can be used for remittance, used as a store of value, can be used for gift cards for most major retailers in the US. The two things that would make things easier for me personally would be a Bitcoin bill pay service and hopefully this Indego point of sale service working out where over 25 million retail shops in Europe will be able to accept Bitcoin. You have explained it well enough. You lost $200k on an assumption that was not presented as a fact. If I can sue for every news article that gets things wrong about Bitcoin I will be bitcoin rich in a month. Case in point.ignore
Yes, Bitcoin is actually a very useful currency.We may need to leave bitcointalk behind to the trolls soon but there will be an option for Bitcoiners to discuss Bitcoin without the constant trolls. I know for a fact this is happening.Someone sent me a PM about something and I responded to him with something nobody else could know.2 other trolls that day brought up that information in response to a couple of posts of mine. Either they are sock pockets or they all sit in the same (chat)room. I had to do this once for a localbitcoins transaction. Buyer did not have a QR code for me to scan. I typed it in from reading it, then he read it off, then I read it off.When it happened again with someone else I realized he could just copy and paste the address to me in a message. "If you are a user of Coinbases Bitcoin Exchange and have information that may be helpful to our investigation or would like additional information regarding this investigation, please contact us"In other words..."We have no clue what to actually go after them for but we see that they have a lot of money so let the lawsuit commence! Please give us information on how we can justify this lawsuit."btwNowhere in any press did CoinBase claim that they had a California Bitcoin license.They are a licensed and regulated exchange ... in California.California coming out and "clarifying" something that did not need to be clarified is pretty lame.That is like me coming out with a statement:"BayAreaCoins is not actually a lawyer that can give out legal advice!"Then people reacting with"What?!? He's not? But I thought he was! I spent $200,000 to file a lawsuit based on that assumption!" I got the idea from this:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_indicatorAccurate 80% of the time at predicting the direction of the DOW.Though looking at all of the past bitcoin prices there was no huge swing, just slightly up or down. All coincidental. I was able to manipulate the PPCoin market early on with as little as $1000. I see no reason why someone with a few million dollars is not doing the same with the Bitcoin price.That is why I do not trade, I just use Bitcoin as it is intended, as a currency and store of value. You can't actually use alt coins. They are for purely giving money to the next guy that promotes his alt enough to get rich. 2011: Price down(ish)     NFC wins2012: about the same     AFC wins2013: Price up               AFC wins2014: Price down           NFC winsSo, if the pattern holds, if the Patriots (AFC) win, the price will go up (or maybe stay the same). Seattle (NFC) wins, price goes down.Based on this, who will you be rooting for? From the show: "Even the people in Bitcoin aren't going to say it's better than gold"I travel a lot, move a lot and consider myself more of a global citizen where I do not plan on living in one place for too long. So I live in a temporary apartment, I can fit everything I own in a carry on and backpack.If I had as much gold as I do in Bitcoin I would have so much difficulty doing anything. This past summer I traveled with all of my belongings from Afghanistan to Dubai to the US then Turkey and finally settling in Germany. I carried everything I own to each location. I could not imagine going through so many airports with over 100 oz of gold. The weight alone would have been difficult, going through security would be crazy and the customs would be tedious. I would worry about someone at every border taking my gold, staying in hotels I would be paranoid about leaving the room (they could steal my laptop with my private keys but they would need 5 different difficult passwords to get to my bitcoins so that getting stolen would only inconvenience me).I'm in an apartment where the landlord comes in and cleans once a week. I can't imagine hiding a bunch of gold in here. Or going into the woods and burying it. I have no idea how to get a German safety deposit box if I wanted to go that route.I like gold but there is no way I can buy any. Sure, it is useful in computers until they figure out something cheaper.I spend my bitcoins. I get paid in dollars but spend euros so being able to use bitwage.co to get paid in bitcoins and spend it for anything online and sell it for euros locally is much better than somehow getting paid in dollars then buying gold then looking for a way to sell gold locally or somehow spend it online.I can pool my bitcoins with other people and vote anonymously, securely and transparently using the blockchain. To do that with gold would require some sort of gathering in a room, maybe some blindfolds and secret marks on each coin...I don't know how it could be done with gold.I never thought gold was very fashionably pretty, I just think of a 70s pimp or Mr. T when I think of it as jewelry. I much prefer the look of silver.So...tl;dr "Bitcoin is better than gold." -Elwar He's all about gold.When gold shot up, he was the man and predicted everything.Not so much now.He started accepting Bitcoin on his website by the way. I went on one of those mortgage calculator sites and plugged in our current $18 trillion debt.With a generous rate of 2%, if we stop borrowing more and start paying a mere $800 billion per year toward the debt we'll have it paid of in 2045.With annual income tax revenue of $1.3 trillion, that leaves us $500 billion for everything else (including our national defense which we currently spend $526 billion on).Maybe we can save money on earmarks which cost around $1 billion per year (don't laugh, that was John McCain's entire economic strategy). BlindMayorBitcorn: Gavin wants to know what has to happen for people to agree to it - he isn't trying to force it through without consensus You keep buying more coin and you'll be a free man.Especially during the upcoming shekel war. We need a chart showing the price going up every time bitcointalk is offline.Also, if you want to know how low the price will be in euros just ask me how much I have a buy in for and it will not go any lower than that.I even tried to make my order look like all the rest to sort of "blend in":0.63176306    190.25000That sat there most of the day even when the USD price went down below the exchange rate for that price. It seems I can only sell my fiat when the price is crashing quickly. I could have started buying at 196 but I have a lot I need to buy and I would have been paying high prices to plow through all of those bids. One guy on a US website puts a Bitcoin address on a terrorist website and now somehow ISIS (the whole organization) is fundraising with bitcoins?First of all, the address is open for anyone to trace.The ISIS in Iraq actually get their funding by going into a city and stealing whatever they can by force.The ISIS in Iraq is full of people that have no clue about technology and cannot even figure out how to flush a toilet (don't ask me how I know this).Donate to this link and I will donate it to the US military:12gbHZgcq26ecTUvJf3LVgyLrYdKtb7vDTUS Military fundraising(Bitcoin) in US 50 bitcoin of blockchain?No reason to sell at that price since you risk not getting your money and by the time you get the money the price will have probably popped over $250 a few times. I think everyone is still wondering. What are we supposed to be pissed about?It's actually pretty exciting, we have a bitcoin exchange in the US. Good luck with your gamble to bully Coinbase into settling with you to avoid bad press Bay. I hope your lawyers are typical lawyers that do not worry about the law getting in the way of a good steamrolling, and you better hope they don't take it to court. Or worse, counter sue and steamroll you in the battle of "which lawyer is better".I can see Coinbase's rep on the stand:"it says in this article 'Bitcoin prices spike after news of first regulated U.S. bitcoin exchange'.""Are you a bitcoin exchange?"Coinbase Rep: "yes""Do you follow any regulations?"Coinbase Rep: "yes, as a US business we face many regulations""So...what the fuck does this BayArea guy think he is doing?"Coinbase Rep: "I have no fucking clue, we are counter suing him for being a dumbass"Judge: "Case dismissed, counter suit awarded in the amount of one billion dollars (to be paid in bitcoins...Bitcoin to da moon!)" If Ron Paul were elected in 2012, we would be seeing budget surpluses in next year's budget which could be used to start paying down that debt (It would not be $18 trillion either). When paying the interest on the national debt is more than our budget...it will cause some problems.Current interest payment is $430 billion.The proposed Defense budget for this year is $526 billion. We will soon be paying more in interest than for our national defense.If some politician says they have some plan for fixing the budget and it does not include addressing the huge debt, they are feeding you a pile of shit.
I think he is hoping that with enough yelling he can create some sort of buzz and somehow sue CoinBase for his bad investment then hopefully get a settlement.Completely ignoring the whole "buy on rumor, sell on news" aspect of trading. It is usually the case to sell on the news because it is not as exciting as the rumors make it out to be (in this case, though CoinBase is licensed and regulated as the rumors presented, it is only regulated in 23 states). Crypto holder I read your sig pushing an alt before I read your comment just to see what approach you were going to take to bashing Bitcoin. You did not disappoint.For every person who says "Alt coins don't hurt Bitcoin, it is a free market and they create a great field of experimentation", I just think of how many trolls each alt coin creates thinking their coin will be the next Bitcoin...if only we can destroy Bitcoin first. Looking at Q3 2014 it shows that the debt to GDP ratio is over 100%. This is when bad things start to happen.Greece passed 100% in 2005. The first austerity measures were implemented in 2010 by the EU to save the Greek economy.The United States does not have an "EU" to implement austerity measures. The United States issues Treasury Bonds. Anyone, including US and foreign citizens, can buy those bonds. Some foreign governments also buy them for the stability of the investment. It is strange that that map says the US debt is $14 trillion. It is over $18 trillion by now. I sent 100 bitcoins and got this pic:So worth it! And that is the main decider, at what point do we plant our flag and say "at this point on we do not kill"?I would think that most of us would not kill a monkey that can actively speak sign language just to fill our bellies.Even vegetarians choose at what level of life they are willing to kill. Do you swat at a mosquito or step on a bug? What about living viruses? Do you bring out the holocaust inducing bleach to eradicate bacteria and other living organisms? Is there a certain configuration of living cells that is ok to kill and not ok?You might plant your flag and say that anything with a smaller brain than maybe 1000 cells can be killed but anything more than that is off limits. This is the same as a meat eater saying we will not eat something with the intellect of a monkey or horse or house pet, but beyond that everything is fair game. Or being willing to kill a human based on some pre-defined justification. First the ability to do so needs to be established, then the willingness to do so. What is stopping you from becoming the CEO of your own business right now and growing it to multi-million dollar status? Based on your post that you will be suing them, I will be sure to short Bitcoin because I believe in my heart that you will do so and this will bring the price down some. No problem, the argument can also go the other way. Us libertarians complain about the government and yet we are willing to use force against those that have less power than us (animals). It makes you wonder, if you were actually in charge would you do anything differently? Especially considering you already have that choice and you choose to use force.Something to think about. I will not try to justify my eating meat. I can probably count the number of vegetables I like on one hand and those are mostly of the potato chip/nacho chip variety. I know it is unhealthy but I try to expand my tastes as much as I can hope to. I have also at times phased in meat substitutes but those processed frankensteins are probably not all that much healthier than the meat version. When you can amass power then you can have control over everyone else.Those 85 people control the most guns which keep the rest of us in line.And by guns, I mean the governments that keep us in line.And yet, so many people believe that the solution to such a wealth distribution is to give the government more power (through taxes/stealing). When all that does is give those people in charge of that power even more wealth. It is called survival of the fittest. That is what our world revolves around.Our governments have more guns, that is how they are able to tell us what to do and jail us if they want to jail us or kill us if they want to kill us.Humans have more power than animals. That is why we can kill them and eat them.If you are outraged about this, are you equally outraged about our governments being able to steal money from us and kidnap us?If animals had more power than humans, then things would be different.We live in an anarchist world, if you want to protect animals, protect them with guns from the other humans (or convince those with the most guns, ie the government, to protect the animals from humans). So Coinbase launched and the price dropped, then you bought on the news you read on WSJ?What I saw was that there was rumor of Coinbase becoming an exchange, then the price went up over $300, then when they launched the price came back down to sane levels. Are you saying the news came out before the launch?Do you have an article where Coinbase stated that they were licensed in California? Technically they are a licensed and regulated exchange in California. I checked, they are licensed in 14 states.That would make them a Licensed and Regulated exchange.Where are they located?  (hint: California)I would not get your hopes up on suing on the theory that it was that news that made the price go down from $300. People bought on rumor and sold on news. A 20+% rise in one day was bound to have a lot of sell off. I would have done the same had I not been traveling. No matter what the news was.You could just as well blame the trolls in the Speculation forum for losing you money with their FUD. It is just as viable. That about sums it up. That was the first conference I had been to so I didn't have anything to compare it to but it does not motivate me to go to any more conferences, it is certainly not what I had expected.Though to be fair, the second day they made seating available and the microphones worked for the most part. If they have at least one license, and they (like all businesses) are regulated. Then they are a Regulated and Licensed exchange.Did someone at Coinbase claim anything more than that? Probably for the millions of dollars worth of licensing and regulation requirements for each of the 50 states in the US, which is the reason why there has not yet been a major Bitcoin exchange set up in the US. Quoted.Hammer ordered through purse.io The java wallets that are available for cell phones are an implementation of that. It has been around for years.
From the White Paper:https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf8.Simplified Payment VerificationIt is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keepa copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by queryingnetwork nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branchlinking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction forhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is morevulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verifytransactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricatedtransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy toprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalidblock, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions toconfirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want torun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification. Gen 2 Social Media like Chicisimo, Google+, Yelp are sure to replace the outdated Facebook considering they offer something better.How much have you shorted Facebook? The only person who does something...is the person that does something. Page 31  all true Tinfoil body suit wearer not affected. There is a Linux distro set up specifically with Bitcoin tools. Some predictions are educated guesses. They are saying that 400bn is if it becomes a payment method replacing services like Western Union, etc... If you read the OP in the "Bitcoin is dead" thread, he is posting the bitcoin obituaries, which is a joke making fun of the many people who have called Bitcoin dead since 2011. I think 25 million Point of Sale terminals given the ability to accept Bitcoin is kinda exciting.http://www.coindesk.com/ingenico-adds-bitcoin-option-to-pos-terminals/  Remember what who did what now? "We've never sold a Bitcoin. We're in it for the long haul," Camerson Winklevoss said during a presentation at ETF.com's Inside ETFs Conference.  I have just had a vision.There will be a great battle between two houses. The evil lord with marks on his body shall be the first to bite. The clouds will burn red. Serpents will strangle the outliers. The grass will be black.Dolphins will fly. Hmm, I saw that but do not see anything on her wall. I would say maybe she has something blocking people from sharing on her wall but I see other people posting on her wall and nothing shows up on my activity. It might be the end of days, but perhaps a new unit will be used. Kinda like the metric system overtaking feet and pounds.When this happens, it will truly be the end of days. I think the most important thing we all need to think about here is that chicken just tastes good. If prepared well, it is just downright tasty.If not for the fact that meat tastes really good and I do not like most vegetables, I would also be a vegetarian. But this fact remains, so it is so. So how does this work for Facebook?I just sent a tip to my sister via Facebook for her birthday.I check her wall and it doesn't show anything, on my ChangeTip page it shows "Out for delivery". Is it supposed to show up on the person's wall? I see, I was more focused on the "They don't seem to have much interest in promoting Bitcoin" part.I would say owning 1% of the currency provides some interest in promoting it.
I use Bitcoin for most of my spending. I think over time with the price rising and falling and my spending reflecting the rise and fall I will be better off over time. I need to verify this before I go into it further. The rate jump to $300 was too quick...it needs to slowly rise to that amount over the next 2 weeks to be a viable climb like in the past. The current price point is a healthy rise. They previously met the federal requirements. Now they are meeting state requirements which require millions of dollars and a lot of time to obtain.  You could always sell your bitcoins via CoinBase in the US. You could also always buy.But this allows investors and traders in the US to more easily get their money onto the exchange to do more day trading. You missed something. I should have added bad for alt supporters too.Price before rumor of Coinbase news:$230Price today:$260Price at the bottom: $152We are on our way up. The bottom is in. Bell had the advantage of a patent which allowed his company to be the only telephone company for several years. Being first has huge advantages. Bitcoin does not fill your body with poison and weaken your immune system making you more susceptible to disease.Though, just like with vaccines, if you do not use Bitcoin, you are not harming someone who does use Bitcoin.http://ow.ly/HXaRt It is called the Network Effect.The key is to reach mass adoption such that they system feeds on itself to grow perpetually. The classic example is the telephone. The more people who own telephones, the more valuable the telephone is to each owner. This creates a positive externality because a user may purchase a telephone without intending to create value for other users, but does so in any case.Do you think Facebook has value because of the code behind it that lets you post pictures and text on a website? Will Facebook lose value because of all of its competitors presenting better solutions any time soon?An alt coin can rave about its great advantages over Bitcoin. Which blockchain do you believe will reach mass adoption first?When Alexander Graham Bell (Elisha Gray) invented the telephone, within 10 years there were over 100 telephone companies in Ohio alone.Which one of those companies became Bell Telephone? Good for Bitcoin.Bad for trolls/bears. Keynesians and their "I like the blockchain technology but not Bitcoin" views in 5...4...3... We all learned that we have seen the bottom.I think it went up way to fast but if we continue this trend upwards it will be an exciting month. *yawn* holding still At the London conference someone mentioned that they will start allowing you to hold dollars in your account and it would be FDIC insured. I just want to thank the Bitcoin Expo folks for letting me give a talk on BitPools. I enjoyed meeting some nice folks and checking out London, they even helped to give me time to go tour the city by having a few hours of Altcoin talk.You may want to re-name your next conference to the Crypto Expo, or Altcoin Expo though.  Might be because people are worried about Florida laws on selling bitcoins since those two guys were arrested in Florida for selling bitcoins without a license.Florida is a big fan of arresting people. Where is this from? Pretty good start to the conference. Roger Ver gave a good talk.I'm kinda frustrated with no wireless access, being in a foreign country with no phone service makes it difficult to spend bitcoins.If you're at the conference, I'm wearing a dark blue shirt (light brown pants). I'm sitting in the "VIP" section up front, stop by and say hey. Where is the ATM? Does it take Bitcoin and issue pounds? Predicting $304 by Feb 13.At that point I will...hold
Ya, then don't put your life savings into Bitcoin.Seriously. Just buy gold and spend it online. FBI would hate the idea that the power to overthrow a government's leader is in the hands of the people. Someone who lies (commits fraud) in order to get money/power/anything from you. Hey guys, with the site losing some posts I just checked and one of my posts on here was lost so I will repeat it now.Bitcoin to da moon!!!  Woot!(Actually I am not completely sure if I said "Woot" or "Woohoo", I submitted a support request to manually retrieve my post just to be sure) $2.3 million to $1,000 on Stamp.That's the lowest I've seen since the price was over $750.Something's happening. I read somewhere that everyone in Estonia has Internet access.They call it e-stonia. Why is the price going up in reaction to good news?Is the topsy turvy world being flipped right side up? I'm not going to use Bit-x if they think we shouldn't invest in Bitcoin. You can even use short wave radios to send a transaction. I thought they put into the code that Janet Yellen is not allowed to use Bitcoin.It locks her out saying "go print some more of your own money Yellen, don't mess with ours". http://www.coindesk.com/bitwage-launches-international-bitcoin-payroll-solution-us-employers/ He doesn't admit to using inside information. He admits to using BitFinex where he has access to accounts and databases.I would use my own exchange to trade if I owned one. I trust that exchange and believe in it. The dots show buys, even while other people may be panicking or over excited, they purchase at regular intervals no matter the emotional state of the market. Doing so gives you an average price you pay out over time.Here is one with the words dollar cost averaging in it: The title is misleading...the merchant needs a net connection. After reading more about this, I found the title confusing. I assumed the merchant could somehow process a payment without a web connection.But the merchant needs a web connection and the user can sign a transaction and pay without a web connection, sending the signed payment over Bluetooth.But if you have a cell phone, it is very likely that you already have an Internet connection.If it could be done where the merchant does not need a connection, that would be revolutionary. I have no idea how it would be done though. A lot of short sighted theories by people who don't actually use Bitcoin regularly. OpenBazaar will be that type of site and it will be better than eBay.But I am sure early on it will take a while for it to build up to the point of having a large customer base. There was a Bitcoin type of eBay and it had a lot of traffic but the guy running it shut it down. Perhaps you missed it going back and forth between $212 and $213 for a while...then up to $214, now back to $213?Hold onto your hats gentlemen. It requires people to keep investing their money for it to continue. Jeff Bezos could take all of that money and they would be left with nothing, even if they paid for a yearly subscription.That is more of the definition of a Ponzi than Bitcoin which would require every user to sell their bitcoins (to people willing to buy them), or however they figure Bitcoin is a Ponzi. Washington Post revealed: a Ponzi scheme for distributing wealth from many liberals to Jeff BezosIf Washington Post were a newspaper, it'd be the worst-performing one in the world, worse even than the New York Post.But Washington Post isn't a newspaper. It's a Ponzi scheme for distributing wealth from many liberals to Jeff Bezos. At least that's all it is right now. It's always been a way to distribute liberal wealth. Politicians, for their part, are quick to point out that it used to be a useful tool for information, like the early internet, and its underlying technology was once useful. Also, they've bet hundreds of millions of dollars on it through advertising.But that's not much of a consolation to anyone who buys a Washington Post expecting any useful information. Even paying $1 to $1.25 on weekdays and Saturday, and from $2 to $2.50 on Sunday, a 25 percent increase. That's because Washington Post has not had any useful information for the past decade, maybe even longer. It's too bad Washington Post doesn't spend their money on reporters that have a clue.
Are we over $300 yet?Nope...still holding. The price will react on its own.I am sure as bitwage.co gets more and more people switching over to people getting paid in Bitcoin the price will have to rise to accommodate the demand. The illegal drug industry accounts for $500 billion in total worldwide per year.If Bitcoin was ever used for more than half of illegal drug purchases the price would have to be over $250,000/BTC.So, is Bitcoin a major player in illegal drugs? If you believe that, then you also have to believe the price for bitcoins will reach 6 digits. What's wrong with drugs?I am told every day that they can help you. I will do this but not just randomly. Maybe as a congratulations or a happy birthday. It is probably best to tip someone who is having a good day.People tend to like something if they experience it on a good day. It's called dollar cost averaging. I have a hard time following the logic when people make a statement that all fiat currency will replace Bitcoin.  In my world view, they coexist and will continue to coexist.  I can see where some Bitcoin functionality is adopted by fiat services, but not on a global level.  Your thoughts? 1 Satoshi will equal 1 Zimbabwe dollar. Holding bitcoin does nothing for Bitcoin.If 1 million people hold 10 bitcoins and do nothing with it, it only affects supply.But if people use Bitcoin by spending it, it might get converted right back to fiat but by doing so you are helping to expand the Bitcoin economy.The larger the Bitcoin economy, then instead of 1 million people holding 10 bitcoins you might have 10 million moving bitcoin through their hands for a tenth of the time but it would affect supply the same way. But that economy would grow and become more useful to the point that it does not need to be converted right back into fiat and a large supply of bitcoins simply stay in the Bitcoin economy.Do not focus on price, focus on what can be done to expand the Bitcoin economy. Price is down 5% from a few hours ago.    Is Bitcoin done?   Don't trade. Convert.I lost about half of my initial 800 bitcoins when I first started by doing daytrading.There is a saying when it comes to poker. If you sit down at the table and you do not see the fish, you're the fish.Do you see the fish to take advantage of when trading? Price was $220 Friday. Price is $220 today.This is the most stability Bitcoin has been in weeks. Are you claiming that you blew up Bitcoin with some rare stability? Holding like a boss. ^This is the guy that said that thing last week.I forget what it was about by now. You could always write a script on your server to send out automated payments. You may want to check out Brawker. This guy was able to pay one of his bills through there:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn90C5tV2JM&feature=youtu.beBasically put the explanation in the additional details portion and get it paid. I still need to test brawker.  I am sure it is just paid out the same day the checks are sent out.Instead of a check for $1000, the price is $200/BTC so employee gets 5 bitcoins.Might even get to them faster than going through their bank. That part being the key here. Don't worry if you cannot understand this chart, those that do TA on a daily basis might be able to decipher it. Either way, it means something pretty big. With dollar cost averaging if I were to spend the exact same every paycheck then it would even out.But, with volatility I am able to re-think my spending based on the price. If the price drops I might avoid going out to eat that week or hold off on a big purchase. If the price goes up I can treat myself to a nice night out or something I have been wanting for a while.But I do not live paycheck to paycheck, I did this knowing I have enough to last me about a year or so. My only bills are my rent, my mortgage (which is being paid by an incoming rent check) and gas/food. My rent is about $1k euro which is nice since the euro has fallen a lot against the dollar. Gas costs me about $50 per month, food about 200 euro. My monthly income is over 5 times those monthly bills.If I want to play it safe, I spend my bitcoins as close to payday as possible. I bought a video game yesterday and by spending bitcoins I got an 8% discount. The price was down about 5% from Friday, so I still come out ahead.
Someone must've forgot a decimal when buying.Oops Too lazy for any To da moon pics this morning so I will just post this:->  O I thought it would look pretty cool but then: If this is the same guy that predicted a big announcement on Friday, then the announcement was that he was taking a nap...then he has less than zero credibility. derp So much activity only to troll. Why would I not want to spend 1.20 bits on a burger? I think more people spend time concerning themselves with the price that figuring out how to spend it on a day to day basis in their own lives. When I first read about Linden dollars and Second Life I read about how the dollars were distributed. I saw that it was issued by a central entity. The article I read said the rate was just over 1 Linden per dollar (or whatever ratio it was), so I did a quick search for the conversion since the article was older. The rate was 2 Linden per dollar. I could see where that was going. No need to touch a currency that could be issued by a central authority at its own whims. Never played the game but did have a job interview from a company that wanted me to develop for them. lol...irony much? How much of Ripple was pre-mined? Umm, so the dude says "Yep... Only two more days till Friday, All the #bitcoin Heads are gonna turn! Epic shit on the way. The Current Roller Coaster is Nothin'"Then come Friday...nothing "I'm going to take a nap".Now he's some sort of marketing genius?This is what is known as fraud. The best way to deal with fraud is to make sure that for any future interaction with the guy, everyone knows the past frauds he has initiated.Then again, we all knew of his previous frauds of spamming people with phishing links. So fortunately nobody made any major purchases or sales based on the news. What do I care of the majority? The majority voted for Barack Obama, the majority spends money at Starbucks.I can use Bitcoin to buy things that I need. I can get paid in Bitcoin. That is all I need. As long as all of the services that exist right now do not go away, I can survive on Bitcoin with no need for centralized, government controlled fiat. We have reached that point. And new services pop up every day, like being able to use Bitcoin on ebay.currency: noun, plural currencies.1. something that is used as a medium of exchange Going back and deleting every post of mine in this thread but this one (I suggest you do the same): They ask for a payroll company. They work directly with payroll companies. not during Beta  I bought a bunch at $850, but that was after selling over $900. I bought in at $17 then did some day trading (losing about half) down to around $3.50. Or that they are actually pushing the price down pre-ETF so that when the price comes back up, their first year portfolio can show a 200% increase. Thus triggering more investors after that, and on and on..
The stories I read said he killed a bear with a knife and there was a song about him..."Davy...Davy Crocket, born on the wild frontier.."I guess old politicians used hype of their childhood to get elected like Washington and the apple tree and such. I started doing this when the price was $22/BTC. Unloaded about a third of them on the news that the US Marshalls were going to auction the Silk Road coins. Bought back in in the $400s.Not in AF anymore, but now instead of converting each paycheck I use bitwage.co to do it for me. Are you talking about the communist theory that if humans are subject to socialism for long enough, then we will evolve to the point where nobody will be greedy?I wish humans would evolve to the point where nobody would ever use force, but I'm not going to hold my breath or subject someone to a system that they do not want to be a part of in order to achieve that. You wouldn't need so many words if you just followed the Keynesian mantra on Bitcoin:"I like the technology of the blockchain, just not Bitcoin."You may also want to try Freicoin. It does what you want and is a total and utter failure. Not useful to who? The people who use it?I use Bitcoin all the time. Are you telling me it is not useful to me? They were giving out the first 50 for free as a proof of concept.The terminals are a plastic housing holding a cell phone. The 3D printing of it is probably more expensive than if they would mass produce a plastic mold. Got paid at a rate of $212/BTC this paycheck. Needless to say, my bitcoin amount was much higher than last paycheck. This is gentlemen!!!! Watching the Euro drop vs the dollar is more interesting.http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=EUR&to=USD How many Euros was in your account? How do speculators not provide price discovery and liquidity? Ya, I guess it's not the big news.Big news for me though. I have more shopping options. For me, that's all that matters with Bitcoin.  The price has been holding at $220 all morning.If it stays this price all day it will be the most boring day to "keep watching the charts".  Adam Guerbuez @AdamGuerbuez  ·  17m 17 minutes agoDat OkCoin Doe..... #BitcoinAdam Guerbuez @AdamGuerbuez  ·  4m 4 minutes agoAre we having fun yet #bitcoin keep watching the charts boys and girls.....  If people start using their API for their databases it creates intrinsic value for Bitcoin.  True, this would likely be common.  Ya, I'll still start small. I've used purse.io and it sounds similar but with more functionality. Looks like it is about Factom: I paid in Bitcoin but tipped the guy in fiat (I figured the owner was likely paid the bitcoins directly so it would skip the server). I got a 10% discount for paying with bitcoin though 
Looks like it is about Factom: Wow...so nobody actually read the article?The agent said that he had considered Mark Karpeles might be running Silk Road because it would be a good way to keep the Bitcoin price under control.So, an agent has a theory a long time ago, backed up by his own opinion for a short amount of time.The defense is trying to create reasonable doubt. That is like having a murder trial and asking "did you have any other suspects? Oh, you suspected the husband!?!...very interesting...." Saw that, I think I will hold off on a mortgage payment through them until I have used them for a few small things. Bitcoin -> Gyft -> E-bayhttp://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-cards/ebay/Gyft and Purse.io for Amazon, Gyft for E-bay You can now buy anything on E-bay with bitcoinshttp://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-cards/ebay/ Oh wow, so it looks like it could be possible. I'll look into this. Oh I'm long...ladies, you know what I'm talking about I have paid for beer (actually I think it was cocktails) with Bitcoin.Why do people who don't use Bitcoin think they are experts on Bitcoin?You go up to the bar, the dude types the price onto his tablet, a QR code pops up. You scan the QR code. A few seconds later "Transaction complete".Done. Even if there were only 1 miner, 3600 coins would still be generated daily (give or take 1 or 2). Everyone knows that Davy Crockett is made up. I used to watch TV shows about his character when I was a kid. I don't know if it's a currency or not, but I get paid in Bitcoin and I buy things with Bitcoin.What should I call it instead of a currency? Tell that to the Keynes mouthpiece, Paul Krugman. Current estimate is July, 2016.http://bitcoinclock.com/ the other one is lame, the cool kids post in this one  $200 on the way to da moon!choo choo! I wonder if this article will legitimize Bitcoin for those libertarians that were on the fence. When I am on my computer, I can just pull up my online wallet. Do a copy/paste of the bitcoin address I need to send to and click send.With my credit card it's usually in my wallet, if I'm at home I have to go to where I put my wallet, get my card, set it down on the laptop while I try to type, then get up again to put it back in my wallet. If I forget I have to get the card to my wallet later.I can also go to something like Purse.io and get a 20% discount if I'm shopping on Amazon. Anything else on the Internet I can use Brawker.Doing it in a restaurant is just fun scanning the QR code and hitting "send". So easy.And I like that my money is under my control. Not the whims of banks and governments. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=889040.msg9802412#msg9802412The killer's name is Quentin Capobianco, the victim's name Jesse.OP's e-mail is:  qtipcapo@aol.com The 3D printed device seems to be a stand for a cell phone.Nice but still like many stores that have a dedicated cell phone or tablet sitting somewhere that is pulled out on the rare occasion that someone wants to pay with bitcoins.
Nice try. I'm not selling. Ahh! it's going down!Everything said today is a lie and everything said yesterday is true!oh nooos!  I get it.So you are saying that we should buy rocks? I chose wtf is going on!! I think the article says more about the end of the Washington Post than it does about anything else. They hate us because they ain us  Not everybody I believe the total amount of days allowed for credit cards to reverse a charge is 180 days...Would someone be able to set up a site where you can buy bitcoins with a credit card, you can see your bitcoin balance on the site. But the coins are not released for 180 days.This would be good for someone who might want to buy immediately upon seeing a low price, or someone who likes Bitcoin, wants to invest but is not worried about spending in the short term and wants the easiest way to buy some.The merchant could even put the bitcoins in an address that the user can watch. And they would have to have a lot of credibility and transparency to keep from jumping ship with people's bitcoins at 179 days. I think there will be a lot more activity after it goes above the $315 price we all started with. Only 8000 bitcoins to $1000/BTC Ya, so it was a lot more than just about Bitcoin, drugs and a relationship were probably the main contributors.As for the hammer, ya it was probably part of a bigger fight. The fact that it came to the guy holding him at gunpoint to sell his bitcoins sounds like they had a lot of fights over money.Though if they did drugs...I would think they would want to keep their money in bitcoins so they can buy from Silk Road. It was likely in December. His posts ended on Dec. 10th.From the looks of it, his roomate (Jesse) was on him to give him money for some reason. The dude comes on here to try to get a loan (either to just pay the guy or use it to make money via localbitcoins), nobody gives him the loan so his roomate tells him to sell the 20 coins he does have. Dude says no so Jesse ties him up, puts a gun to his head and forces him to cash it out.Guy breaks free, bludgeons the guy with a hammer.Or it could be something else entirely that happened. Or you could put me on ignore like I did to you.To da moon? So...mining costs are $80-$120?But..."miners have to sell all of their bitcoins to cover their costs" -Every bear ever (even when the price was $1000) Holy shit, this is insane:http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150113/long-island-city/bitcoin-trader-accused-of-murder-was-tied-up-coerced-sell-stocks-dahttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=889040.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=400875;sa=showPosts Holy crap, this guy must have really needed the money. Sounds like his roomate was on him to get some money.http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150113/long-island-city/bitcoin-trader-accused-of-murder-was-tied-up-coerced-sell-stocks-da I tended to keep an eye on the cost of going to $800 on BitStamp over the past year. It was usually around $9 million, went up to $10 million at one point, was around $7-$8 million for most of December.Now it is at just under $3 million to $800.I suppose it could just be that many people who had their asks before just haven't gotten around to putting them back up, or they moved their coins out maybe putting them on another exchange.Either way, it is quite a large drop.(I started watching when the price was in the $600s...the amount did not change a whole lot. I would say it was a thought experiment by Socrates. Philosophers can more easily get their point across when they talk about a society in a bubble. Because when you add external influences things become more complicated.So, he creates this mythical city under the water in middle of nowhere when talking about his ideas and thoughts.People usually talk about some "island" when trying to simplify a societal thought that they are trying to get across. It makes things easier.
So Martians are finally getting into the game...to da moon! Bitcoin started with 1 user. Now it has more.I am not sure if every 100% of people in the world uses Bitcoin or not, I cannot verify this.But the theory is that the rate of adoption might be higher than the rate of inflation. But if we are at 100% adoption then the rate of inflation is like 10% per year that the price will need to go down, until next year where it is 5%.Has anyone looked at the stats? Are we at 100% adoption yet? Because the price is way undervalued right now. Mine just went through this morning...what happened to the reasons the price went down yesterday? Umm...3600 coins per day! Ponzi? Failed experiment! Come on guys...panic sell again already. One of the last things I need to cut off my bank account is the ability to pay my mortgage in bitcoins. I currently pay via an automated bank check sent out each month.I like Brawker how they do a multi-sig setup for paying for things online based on a web link to the item.I would like something like that where you give the bank info and customer number with the amount you want to go out and someone sends out the check for your bills. Then when it is verified that it is paid the funds are released.Bonus points for allowing for the ability to set it up to repeat monthly. Same argument was being made at $5 per bitcoin when it was 7200 per day. It is real With the illegal drug trade being 1% of global trade, if Bitcoin was used for just 1% of all illegal drug trade the question should be...Is 3600 coins per day enough?$20 trillion in global trade -> $200 billion in illegal drug trade -> $2 billion in Bitcoin drug trade per year.3600 * 365 = 1,314,000 per year$2 billion / 1314000 = $1522 Do people use bitcoins for drugs? Spooky rumor is that the blockchain is haunted. OP has not responded since his initial question. Something tells me the first 2 or 3 pages may have contained the answer to his question. I see, so it is a concept that is useful for talking among college professors and politicians but not useful in the real world. Understood. It is useful. I use it as a currency. Most things I buy online I can use Bitcoin. And I just read up on Brawker and it appears to cover everything else online. At a big discount. So there's that...Does anyone spend money online? Ding ding ding!!!And there is the whole point of the PoW threads.Hawk your alts.No thanks, I would prefer the most secure network in the world.Next! But it is currently inflating more than the dollar and yet spending has not increased.Can Keynesians ever be right or has there been any instance throughout history where they have been right? Other than 600 years ago when tulips happened. Once. We have laws also. Some people might think that those laws determine what is right and wrong (moral). Actually I have spoken to many people who believe that laws are the definition of morals. Or maybe change the wording of it and talk about Proof of Work. Nobody has addressed that at all anywhere.And be sure to let us know which alt would provide the best solution. That is always helpful to know. Gavin was working on Bitcoin long before the Bitcoin Foundation was created and I do recall he was the one that made the announcement that they were working on creating the Bitcoin Foundation. The Bitcoin Foundation is nothing official, just a club with members. I can create the Bitcoin Club tomorrow and name myself Chief of Knowledge. But why? It should be brought up at least twice a week so that people will finally listen! Maybe once a day for emphasis.When people realize that the cost of mining is the exact same as the price per 3600 per day, no matter what the price and no matter what the real hardware and electricity costs are, it will blow their minds!When the price was $1,000 per bitcoin, the hardware and electricity costs to run Bitcoin were $3.6 million!And now, at a lower price, the cost of hardware and electricity is over $600k.That is like buying a computer for $1000, but if the price of corn goes up, your computer suddenly costs $2000 more. Even after you paid for it. And your electricity price jumps too. EMP? That sounds scary!    Has someone demonstrated that they can do a worldwide EMP that will destroy every instance of the blockchain?Should I be packing my things tonight to go to a cave? Let me know soon, I'm going to start packing and come back to check. It's not easy to figure out without a Magic The Gathering Online eXchange.
That moment you realize that $18k can get you 100 bitcoins... At the current price, 3600 bitcoins per day times $180...that's over $630,000 per day!So mining costs $630k per day right now!If the price drops to $100 that's $360k per day!And at $300 mining costs over a million dollars per day!That is so crazy how mining cost changes so quickly. I wouldn't want to mine. I pay for the machine, plug it in, then the price to keep it running goes up and down depending on the price. I have never thought of that!Why has nobody brought this up before?!?  Ignore...Next! Burn the witch! Re: I told youI know you are but what am I?  I did a search for "tulips" in the search box on here yesterday and it crashed bitcointalk.Yes, there are THAT many threads about tulips.Please, OP...point out another example.  Got none? Because that's the only one in history. They were friendly too in the 80s when Yakov Smirnov became the ambassador for Russia and Reagan and Gorbechov were buddies. Russian and US be like I'm not in the US. p2p transactions are legal where I live I accidentally forgot to add the decimal point when selling some bitcoins. I was trying to sell 100.00oops They are still given private monopoly status by the local governments.  Isis 'execution video' purports to show 10-year-old boy shooting dead two 'Russian spies'http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-execution-video-purports-to-show-10yearold-boy-shooting-dead-two-russian-spies-9975648.htmlRussia will likely want to retaliate, and with the US having so much interference in Iraq they may need to cooperate with the US to bomb ISIS back to before the stone age. Train to da moon!!! Damned greedy people on the Speculation forum.You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Give some money to poor people and cut off your balls to feed starving puppies. If you ever...ever use Amazon, why would you not pay with bitcoins through purse to get 20%-30% off of your purchase?I see people on Facebook with these "How I cut my spending by 10% with one simple trick" posts and think...only 10%? Yes, even NotLambChop (if he was posting on here) would agree.
Most of us didn't think there would be an epic rise to $1200.All the talk was about "what would you do if Bitcoin was $100?". Up 10% in the last hour.To da moon?  I posted a jpg of my transfer yesterday for some other fool that does not believe me. But I really do not care who believes me, the point still stands. The reason the whole early adopter argument is stupid is because in the early adopter days buying bitcoins was just as risky as it is buying today. As if somehow buying a shitload of bitcoins when we were celebrating the word bitcoin being mentioned in a news article was not super risky. Sit back and watch while the new early adopters buy at these low prices this week. Shut your yap when you regret it a year from now. Morality is just the question of what is right and what is wrong.Just because your religion spells it out for you, does not mean that those that do not have such structure cannot tell what is right and what is wrong. I still have a day or two before my deposit gets on the exchange, and my paycheck is converted to bitcoins on Friday. I hope this low price sticks around for a few days.But if anyone posts crap about early adopters and they knew about Bitcoin before January 14, 2015...then they have nothing to complain about. They had their chance. If you are reading this right now and you do not buy bitcoins at this price, you cannot ever complain about early adopters again.At this price, anyone can be an early adopter right now. Average Joe dumping thread needs to add:13) Make sure to advertise the alt you really want to succeed when telling everyone you sold all of your bitcoins. I deposited my money at the ATM on Saturday, my funds were finally available today, started my SEPA transaction today...it will be 2-3 days before my funds reach the exchange where I can buy at such low prices!  Argh!!!  Who would invest in such a lame system with such slow transaction times? Theymos is Satoshi.All of the ad revenue he gets from the trolls was his plan all along. I bought 50 oz of gold when it was $400/oz.I was shaken a bit by different news sources about the price and ended up selling at $425. I wish I had just put it away too I put away most of my bitcoins for long term but I still use it as a currency. It is very useful and easy. Those that see it as a commodity are worried about the price.Those that use it on a daily basis as a currency do not worry so much about price.Since my last paycheck the price has gone down almosts $100. But in 3 days, I get paid again and get bitcoins for $100 less. Wish I didn't have to wait for these SEPA transaction times of several days to get my money to the exchange. Cloud mining....your bitcoins are in the cloud.Just don't ask for them.They're on the line. Ya! Free speech! Congress shall make no law abridging the right of bitcointalk members to start troll threads!And the right to bear arms too!You can take my guns from my cold dead hands!!! Thank you kind sir. Please, save us all from the scary limited supply electronic currency.My brother warned me at $17 that the government would ban it.Last week he finally asked me how to accept Bitcoin for his business. It usually helps if you advertise the alt coin you invested in in your OP message. If you ever....ever...buy anything on Amazon, whether you like Bitcoin or not, getting 20-30% off on Amazon purchases through Purse is quite nice. The long wording is very confusing "...majority group to designate someone to hire someone...".A few cartoon pictures would make it more interesting. I included the link to the article that goes into detail on where they got the numbers. And those numbers are conservative. Your Amex Platinum must be different than mine then. I've had it for over almost 2 decades so maybe I was grandfathered in at a better rate. I still plan on dropping it though.
Instead of profit, try Bitcoin as a currency. It is really useful. Worst newbie clone scam ever. Interesting. Pirate ended his Ponzi scheme and the price dropped from $12 to around $10.Then it went up.A lot. I like socializing. East coast waking up thinking Maybe it is disappointment that she does not have her lips around your wang. I just wish I had bought his $50,000 wall. I am fine with bears, they see the value at a lower price...but they see a value.Then there are the trolls "you bitcoiners", "failed experiment", "ponzi", "tulips", etc.I have yet to go on dollartalk.com and point out the bubble that is the dollar index. They will learn on their own. In the meantime, I dismantle the old ways of living with fiat currency and build up my bitcoin lifestyle. holding at 10:1 margin At this point, it is the job of every alt coin holder to destroy Bitcoin. lol I will just step in to post that the price of bitcoins when OP got out is hovering around $230.  She is closing her eyes because she is picturing me. The Platinum card, which costs $150 per year in fees. If you spend $8k per year you'll get a free plane ticket in 3 years. That only costs $450. And if you screw up (like the average household with over $2k in credit card balance) you are hit with 18% in fees.I'm done with playing that game. Give me real money and no banks/credit cards. Which law allows you to sell something but only up to a certain amount? Bitcoin is not an investment. It is a currency.Good luck buying a plane ticket or booking a hotel room online using your gold and silver. As the price was rising, all of the Keynesians kept harping about how nobody would spend bitcoins because they would want to wait to spend later when the price is higher, never spending their money.And yet, for the past year the price has been going down, high inflation, a Keynesian dream. And yet, the spending did not skyrocket.Why are Keynesians always wrong about economics? True...I don't see any bears hounding about BBQcoin's price, and that is a currency that has been dead for years.I am glad they are all around keeping things active. If they weren't posting and the price was this low I would be worried. I would love to go to the Amsterdam conference but it is during the week and I have to work.But I will be going to the London conference that weekend. lol
Is the low price because of all of the Ponzi mining companies finally coming to their natural end? OP quiz would be better with pictures. I am buying like crazy...just hope the bank transfers get there in time for these low prices.Can't wait for friday's paycheck in bitcoins. $3.6 million away from $1000 on BitStamp From what someone else mentioned, they are working directly with the payroll companies. So it is likely that they know when the payroll company releases the money, from which company and for which employee. At the very least, when they receive the deposit they see the company that did the deposit.It does not look very easy to duplicate so they will likely not see competition soon, and it is not something that will be easy to copy in other companies unless you work in the payroll industry. Sideways to $100k.   The only authority Paul Krugman has is about how an alien invasion is needed to save our economy.When I first heard about Bitcoin I figured it was some made up money by scammers and only gold would be a valueable currency. Then they posted Paul Krugman's article about Bitcoin is Evil on the Ron Paul forums and I figured...there might be something to this Bitcoin thing. Many others agreed. Paul Krugman, his article about Bitcoin is Evil.I thought, surely if Paul Krugman thinks something is evil...I need to get involved with that. No, I think it'll skip $300 and shoot right up.  You answered your own question. Price is up, next stop $100,000!!! If you are wondering who Satoshi is, you should read this:Finding Satoshi True, it is just a matter of structure. I just always found that people in other countries charge a lot less than Americans. And that is speaking as an American software engineer. Nobody would pay my salary if I was competing as an independent contractor in the private sector. Oddly enough, I hired a guy from Australia to work on my website. Also someone from India.It is true about the creativity. The Australian guy did what I wanted him to do and added his own flare which was "better" than what I asked for. The Indian guy gave me -exactly- what I asked for, no more no less.But for both of them, I did not have to pay unemployment tax, medicare, social security tax, health insurance, dental, vision, withholding, vacation time, sick days, holidays, 401k, etc. The best business model for a software company involves hiring private contractors from other countries that do the work for 1/10th the cost and do not come with all of the labor costs that come with having a US based business. http://www.inc.com/adam-bluestein/obamacare-guide-2015-small-business.html"After multiple delays, the Obamacare employer mandate will finally take effect on January 1, 2015." I have noticed a lot of people that do not actually use Bitcoin, complaining about its "shortcomings".I wish that damned Yeun was not so big, it doesn't fit in my pocket and when it gets wet it erases all of the numbers. Is this why it is going down vs the dollar? Time to bring up my CPU miner.
Everyone seems to know why the price is coming down.Transaction times eh? You see a lot of complaints by the users do you?As a an actual bitcoin user, I don't see it. I don't invest, I convert. One word:Obamacaresuck it small businesses I would be worried about falling off the bottom of the world.Or getting dizzy from the spinning. I predict early 2016 at this point. Unless they have to re-file yet again. You should not invest in Bitcoin. Go buy US bonds or Treasury notes if you want an investment.If you are tired of fiat and want a good alternative, convert your money to bitcoins. Not with the intention to sell, but with the intention to live on bitcoins. Not bad, I would have gone with them if they had any rooms available on Expedia. But they are booked, and I like to use Expedia so I can pay with bitcoins  I am getting all of my paycheck in bitcoins. It is not all that different from dollar cost averaging.  I see, from the e-mail it looked like every 48 hours ("Don't worry, you still have 48 hours to post something").I am holding until at least $330, then I will consider selling so...didn't have much reason to post. http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-conclusions-costs-bitcoin/ I'm out. Thought it would be a fun game to check in every once in a while on certain highs and lows but I have enough things going on to need to check into a thread every other day.  ahh, so someone who does not support Bitcoin posting on the Bitcoin forums.That is the fastest way to my ignore. Even with PoS, the cost would be the same per block. So, when the block reward is cut in half will the cost to run the network half as well?How many coins are rewarded each block for the PoS, Litecoin system? So...go buy Litecoin and get it accepted?Problem solved. For the rest of us, Bitcoin works. The fact that tulips comes up so much kinda makes the case a lot less powerful considering....that is one case out of hundreds of thousands of things that have had value throughout history.But yet, tulips...brought up...repeatedly.Hey guys...tulipsit happened once, it can happen againwant an example of a bubble?hmm...tulips? I use it almost every day but I do most of my commerce online. Hmm, that would be a smart move...and probably put in a few of their own orders at the current price to lead by example.Or you have some people with buys at $1 and sells at $10,000 slowly moving closer until the price is found. I think that would be more fun. So, they're back but still at a price of $276?I sold some cheap coins through localbitcoins just now because the price was pegged to bitstamp price. 
No regulations please. What you want already exists in puzzle pieces across the world. They will come together for everyone eventually. Most exchanges have an API for getting the price. You just call that API and you get a number. Display it via HTML. Done. The next 12 hours are  The price is too low.Like this lady's lips:  I guess not so much better as the second half of the 80s the economy did fairly well. His first years brought on a lot of economic insanity and I believe a lot of it has to do with trying to get the dollar back after the Carter years. I am not a big fan of Reagan's huge deficit spending though. I spend bitcoins all the time, it's like pulling out a credit card by now. The first thing after my last paycheck was probably a plane ticket to London for the London expo using cheapair.com It is very fast. My company sends out the payroll on Thursday and I usually get paid on Friday, but looking at my e-mail, the first check showed going through on Friday my second check showed it going through on Thursday. Some of my co-workers use USAA so they get paid on Thursday, most regular banks have always given me a delay.If you are looking for a better estimate I will pay closer attention to the time next paycheck. Updated the chart.Looks like we were close to the linear price (between halvings) until the BitStamp crash.I am confident it will return eventually. Is this the address?117 Wallis Road, Hackney Wick, Hackney, London E9 5LNIt is different from the location I saw on one of the maps for conferences.I would rather get a hotel near the expo. The only way it is proven a failure is if it is not accepted and not mined.No matter the price, I still get paid in bitcoins and can spend it for flights, hotels, Amazon purchases, I can trade for euros via localbitcoins to pay my rent and for food.I will not worry until those things start to go away. I think MtGox was still up when they were doing that, you just couldn't get your coins or cash out. They were using MtGox points/rewards/whichever to transfer the funds. I think with Pirate he had a thread like so many you see "I have a way to make you money, give me your bitcoins". The only people who made any money on that were taking such a huge risk by being the initial people to give him bitcoins. Then as they started getting returns they verified that it was "legitimate" and others started sending him their bitcoins. Those first people are probably the only ones that didn't lose their shirts. By the time it seemed "safe" (because of so many claiming they were getting what they were promised) the money was gone. I almost jumped on that, the return was very tempting. I think like 10:1  Yet another thread where someone asks a question. The question is answered in the first page, the OP is never heard from again. Exact same thing happened in the US from 2005 to 2009. Prices did not continue to go up.How many years have Canada's housing boom been going on? I recall a similar debate when Bittorrent got started.There were several people who would not use it because it was being used to send child porn.Bittorrent is still going so I guess it was not boycotted by everyone. Nah, just another weak hand that when his investment goes up to $120k and starts to fall he drops Bitcoin and goes back to his notes.That is not of any use to Bitcoin.If he has 100k and he does not want to lose his money when the dollar crashes or if he is tired of supporting wars and violence, then I would say convert it all to bitcoins and never look back. But the 6 to 12 month thing kinda gave him away.
 Profit in what? If you want more fiat out of Bitcoin then you may want to just stick with fiat instead. If you get a leader in there that wants to bring value back to the CAD, they will raise interest rates.Reagan did this in the early 80s raising interest to almost 20%. It brought a shock to the economy at first but ended with a better economy overall. Yes, as long as I follow the same process of FIFO or LIFO.  I think LIFO makes it easier for keeping close to the price I paid when I spend. Good segment, I thought the same thing when I watched it. Cell phones and electric cars too  Being able to do something illegal and get away with it shows that the currency would even be useful under a tyrannical government.Imagine using bitcoins to buy a bible in a country where that is illegal. Would you consider that immoral? Bitpay having an online wallet is actually good news. They have a large amount of merchants that do not hold bitcoins. If they can start to easily hold bitcoin it would be quite useful. Proof? If I used Magic cards and could play with them with friends, why would I care if the whole world also plays with them?I can use bitcoins for about 90% of my spending. The rest I can sell bitcoins for cash. I see no problem if we continue with our current adoption and services. Though I know more services are coming. This, survival of the fittest.  The US government gets to determine what the laws mean because they have a lot of guns and military power. The income tax is allowed in its current form simply for the shitty reason that it has been that way long enough so they use that excuse to make it legal.Like if it was found out that using eminent domain to create military bases was against the 3rd Amendment, just nobody really thought about it until now, it would be de facto legal because of precedent.There is no point in arguing with an entity with a lot more power than you that they should have less power. You will never win that argument. He has a small boy in his pants. How did nobody notice that? lol...why was that not the BitPay sales pitch during the Bitcoin bowl?   Hmm, drug user ->Bitcoin:Wants drugs, goes online, open Tor/Silk Road 3, pay bitcoins for drug, wait for drugs in the mail.Cash:Wants drugs, goes to the gang area of town, buys drugs, dealer is selling from rival gang's corner, gun fight breaks out, tries to get away with his life.So, you choose the violent option? The world market for drugs is $6 trillion.The Bitcoin market cap is $4 billion.If Bitcoin was only used for drugs Bitcoin would only make up .07% of all of the drug trade.If Bitcoin was used more than other currencies for drugs (>51%), every Bitcoin would be worth $230,000. I'll be there, what is a good hotel nearby? Or is the conference at/next to a hotel? They said they keep 10-15% in hot storage.So...at least 180,000 bitcoins. Ya, I don't buy gift cards from there. Just products. I bought my dad his Christmas present through there. It worked by when it arrived he was confused by the name of the sender. Your right to freedom is granted the day you are born. From there, it is all about defending that right.Your right to free speech is not something the government gives you. You have the right to free speech simply by being alive. The government is just saying that they are being ever so courteous as to not interfere with that particular freedom.The government takes away your freedoms and leaves you with your remaining "rights".
This. The response to the 2nd Amendment was demonstrated during something called the "Civil War" (aka the war of northern aggression). This is good to know, I use Purse for many online purchases usually getting at least 20% discount. I've been satisfied so far.  Wow, I thought Pirate was in jail. Did he create BitShares as a more technically magical Ponzi scheme?If you have a thousand bitcoins and you convert them to BitBTC, and then you hold it for six months, then you convert the BitBTC plus the dividends you received back to bitcoins, youll end up with more bitcoins than you started with.Wow...a Bitcoin generating alt! But wait, where do they get the extra bitcoins to give to people that held for six months? Surely not from new people investing their bitcoins... If you don't like Bitcoin's distribution, you'll hate Ripples.With Ripple, 3 people own 90% of the coins. TBitcoin takes a few seconds to transfer.The first confirmation stored on the blockchain takes 10 minutes.You are mathematically safe from a chargeback after 60 minutes.With a credit card you are not safe from a chargeback until 180...days Yep, I know what you mean. Bitcoin is a technology and this is one benefit it provides that fiat does not.  I was thinking more like a separate subsection where people can talk without the trolls. Kinda like how you might like to go to a club meeting and discuss whatever it is your club is interested in without some losers coming in shitting all over the place. Imagine being in a chess club where some football player comes and sits in the room all day while you're trying to play chess saying "why do you play this stupid game? You're not doing anything physical at all. This is such a pussy game. Why don't you just push his king over? Why is it only black and white, why not add some color or mascots? This sucks.". I certainly do ignore the trolls. I tend to give the benefit of the doubt to people that are skeptical so I have to read through a few pages of posts before I realize it's just someone that went through all of the effort to create a user just to waste people's time. Ok, I see that you are not really here to discuss the benefits of Bitcoin so I will leave you to your fiat. But if you look at any monopoly, their only existence is due to government force. I believe the solution you seek is guns and violence. Those are the only ways to bring "fair" distribution (and by fair, I mean fair as defined by the people with the guns).Bitcoin is not a monopoly owned by a single entity. You could buy a bitcoin right now and no one person would own 100% of it. I re-post my initial reaction to your OP with the appropriate image: A monopoly cannot exist without force. There you go then. If you know how it can benefit society, you have your answer.If you don't like its current distribution, do something about it if you want, or not. Start a new alt coin and start distributing it evenly to everyone. They did that in Iceland with Auroracoin. Didn't work out as people had hoped. The graphic and 70% unused can both be true. If a wallet is unspent, how would it be included in a graphic about bitcoins being spent? I was not responding to you.If you don't know the benefits of Bitcoin, why are you here? Have you read the white paper? What I like the most about your numbers are that that large percentage of bitcoin holders were here early on. They actually took the risks because they believed in Bitcoin and what it stands for.The people who want to bring in regulations and redistribution belong to the small percentage. The longer that is true, the better. You really should try freicoin...that sounds like a better currency for you. Do you spend a large portion of your life worrying about what other people have compared to yourself? Is every average joe in society the exact same person? Please describe how this person that represents every single person lives, works, spends his money, etc. on a daily basis then I can address this mythical question.I can, however, speak for myself. I live in Germany working for a US company that pays me in dollars. Thanks to bitwage.co I can get paid in bitcoins. Thanks to localbitcoins I can turn those bitcoins into euros. This conversion actually nets me more money than I am paid in dollars because of the high demand for bitcoins for cash. I like the ease of buying things online with bitcoins instead of giving all of my credit card information, making sure I use whatever address they need to match up to my credit card, make sure my credit card isn't cancelled because I used it in some foreign country without calling the credit card company.I like that my bitcoins are not run by a central authority who needs war and violence to continue its operation. That my bitcoins are not a currency that is on the hook for over $18 trillion in debt and climbing. I like that I can go to Prague for the weekend and spend bitcoins without paying for the high conversion cost to the local currency.Average Joe will use Bitcoin or not. For me, it is helpful. I guess my biggest question would be, why are you on a Bitcoin forum if you have no interest in Bitcoin?Are you trying to "save us" from ourselves? Multisig will help a lot.When wallets were first introduced your .dat file was saved in text forum, unencrypted. Encrypting that helped a lot. Multisig will help when it comes to keeping your keys safe. The OP is a non sequitur anyhow. How can X help society by redistributing wealth?Redistribution of wealth does not help society.QED 
I do not buy bitcoin expecting to become rich. I transfer my wealth from a bad currency to a good one.Those who do not see it should stick with their notes. They deserve them. This, those that actually produce will reap the rewards. Stay a cog in the wheel and let those that innovate move the world forward. Freicoin is a commy coin. It loses value the longer you hold it. OP would probably love it. Cell phones, QR codes...people who used to have no access to banks now have access to a world currency not manipulated by dictators? I am not trying to sell BTC to society. Society is what got us here in the first place. Bitcoin is for me. It makes my life easier. If this is not true for you, do not use it. Enjoy your notes. Because Bitcoin is not controlled by a central entity that gets to award those closest to that central entity and punishes those furthest away from that central entity.We are all on equal footing with equal access to Bitcoin. If you are not buying bitcoins right now, you have nothing to complain about. If you thought it was too risky the first time you heard about it and did not buy, you have nothing to complain about. If you have not been involved in your world that includes Bitcoin and just skate through life hoping for something better but not doing anything about it, you have nothing to complain about.Those that work and take risk are being rewarded. Those people are improving society. Enjoy your diminished wealth if you are not one of them. 18,000 from one address -> tumbler -> 18,000 at different addresses -> 18,000 at one addressGood luck finding my hacked coins suckers! Go back to 2009...implement Bitcoin the way it is.Done. Bitcoin is now hacker proof.You do know it is 2015 right? You had equal access to Bitcoins in 2009 as everyone who mined them. You have equal access to bitcoins right now at such a low price.Or is it still too risky? Those that take the greatest risks gain the greatest rewards. Kudos to those who took risks in this realm.You should be looking to the people with guns if you want wealth redistributed. Are you buying right now? When 1 Bitcoin is enough to run a nation's economy will you be upset about people holding 10? We get some socialist on here about once a month bringing up their insanity. For them I say...Bitcoin is not for you. Stick with your notes. Only guns and violence can distribute wealth equally, a currency does not choose winners and losers.Want to distribute wealth equally? Buy now while the price is low. Give it away when you are rich. But...but...I see on the TV that kids in Africa live in huts. This must represent all of Africa or they would not show it on the moving picture show in my living room. Either way, those 18,000 are now frozen in a single address unless the hacker can come up with some ingenious way of cashing them out without being tracked.That is almost like burning 18,000 bitcoins. Definitely bullish. thank you Yes, my plans are my plans. The slave was free to run to the north if they could as well. Doesn't make theft any less theft and slavery any less slavery. A government does not create land any more than you get your rights from a government. The government controls that land solely because they have the power to do so, and they get that power by stealing it from anyone they can take from and get away with it.I do not live in the US or use government services but I am still required to pay medicare, social security and all income over $100k. There are several countries that run just fine without taxes but most people have been brainwashed to believe that is the only way a government can get its revenue. Just like many people likely believed that the only way cotton fields could be picked was through slavery. I am sure the slave masters made similar excuses about the land the slave lived on and the food they ate. My landlord does not rob me and then grant me the privilege of living in my apartment.As for me, I did GTFO.No matter how you cut it, whatever goodies the government gives away, how much they spend on protection, free TVs, free health care...whatever, they take my money without my permission.You can't talk about what the government provides until you address the part where they steal from people.Theft is theft is theft, it doesn't change because of what happens afterwards. Closing your eyes and covering your ears saying that the forced taking of money is not theft all you want. Because it is an ancient tradition, society allows it without thought. Like they did with slavery and war. It is not me who believes that theft is the best way toward a good economy. 
Whoever stole Bitstamp's coins are UP in bitcoins.Theft tends to yield good revenue. This is what the US economy relies on. The better their military at keeping those taxpayers in line, the better the economy. The poll results are basically equivalent to asking "Are you a troll?" Yes: 15% What if I sharted a little bit? You assume that the taxpayer can pay the interest on the debt every year. But the interest on the debt has risen to one of the top 6 budget expenses and as it rises we will reach the point where there are not enough taxes to cover the interest plus any sort of other expenses. Debt cannot continue to climb with no detrimental results.And when the Fed needs to print money to buy US treasury bonds to keep down that interest rate and allow the US to continue to be solvent, they are shifting the burden by devaluing the dollar.In short burts they can bounce back. Over the long term it leads to inflation.Sure we have the military which is one of the top 3 budget items, and they can attack countries like Iraq who started talking about going off of the dollar for oil sales. But that just adds to the spending and adds to the problem. And higher taxes do not necessarily result in higher income as people work to shelter their money from those taxes, just look at the failure of the 75% tax in France.Depending on violence and force to prop up your economy is not the best way forward even if in the short term it seems like it is working. That system always requires more force and more violence before it comes to an end. This is another option. The owners ponying up their on Bitcoin stash to cover it.Their investors paid them in fiat so I would imagine they have to keep most of their profits in fiat. And Bitcoin is not quite at the stage yet where large companies can hold them. They are stuck with old technology when it comes to multiple people having access to the accounts. Yes, I would not expect it to be instant. BitStamp would need to have a strategy to transition back to equilibrium but in the meantime they would have a fractional reserve thing going on.So, what would be the best approach to return to equilibrium? That was in response to this:Do you know the concept of bubbles?Like this one: Do you see Keynes as a God or just below the level of deity status?  Bitstamp says they had 10-15% of their bitcoins in their hotwallet.So, for easy math let's say they have 180,000 bitcoins and the last I checked they had over $10 million in orders.They didn't have any of their fiat stolen, but they only have ~162,000 bitcoins.They can probably add $5 million worth of fiat from their corporate account or investors or whichever. They will then need to convert that $5 million to bitcoins to get back to equilibrium of 180,000 and $10 million.So, how do you believe they will do that? I was trying to help OP. Price dropped because all the Bitstamp coins were dumped. As long as a group of people can combine their resources to have more power than you, they will have more power than you. Where did OP say that? http://www.cheapair.com As someone who uses Bitcoin for remittance, it is short sighted to say that it cannot be done because people don't use bitcoins in whichever country.I get a much better rate going USD->BTC->EUR than I do USD->EUR.And now that I can get paid in bitcoins using bitwage.co I just do BTC->EUR.As has been shown here several times in this thread, sending money fiat->Bitcoin->fiat is cheaper than the current options for Phillipinos. It is just a matter of time before it is used all over the world for this. If you have a cheaper version of the same product as someone else, either your product will eventually take over or the competition will need to lower their prices to compete. It is only a matter of adoption. The man on the street is partially responsible for the currency we have now.Bitcoin is for the man who thinks. The man on the street will die on the street. Welcome to Bitcoin!You may want to stop by the Beginner Help section here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=39.0 They sell now, then in a few years they return and complain about all of the early adopters holding so many coins. Dude, you spent entirely too much time on one troll post.Go back to your Ripple forums dumbass. https://rebit.ph/
Let's hope I meant $250 and not $2.50 So...accumulate fiat, sway newbies to not buy Bitcoins so that one day Bitcoin will be worth a lot.And I create one thread getting rid of such silliness and everyone goes nuts. Perhaps their employers require them to post once in every thread. Agenda noted. At least you're not a paid troll. You should loose your mind...open it up a bit. Is this low price just a ploy by those in power to make us all rich?I have a feeling that it is. I pulled it from the current price.I look around, and mining is still going. It does seem odd, but for some reason, whatever the price. Bears would have you believe that mining costs exactly the price of those bitcoins.Every single price. Even $10/BTC the stupid threads about how much the network was losing by mining costs every month. If you noticed that the thread is surprisingly free of trolls, you are welcome.If your post has been deleted. You are part of the problem, not the solution.Enjoy your Federal Reserve Notes and everything they support. My employer has no idea I am getting paid in BTC. Bitwage is like a reverse BitPay. BitWage gets paid in fiat from my company via direct deposit and converts it to BTC for me.My company takes care of my taxes, 401k, benefit deductions, ObamaCare, etc. before they send on the direct deposit.As far as trusting bitwage, I trust them about as much as an exchange. They hold none of my bitcoins, the worst they could do is keep one of my paychecks. At that point their whole business would be finished and nobody would use them again. And because they use ACH, my company would probably get the deposit reversed. You should figure out first how you want to spend them. And you are here to save us all with your 4 year old knowledge?No need to answer, you will come up with whatever excuse as to why you are on a website for Bitcoin trying to do whatever it is you think you are trying to do. I am glad that the free market is alive and well when it comes to whatever industry is funding whatever it is you do in the posts I fly past.If Bitcoin were ever under attack by fiat and banking to the point where rich bitcoiners were willing to pay me to troll whatever the fuck sites that fiat users collaborate on, I too would be more than willing to take such payment if they paid well enough. I would not, however, be willing to waste my life doing so for free. That would be pure insanity of which I would immediately seek professional help upon such a realization. If you are not being paid, I apologize for belittling your condition. It is not as set up for typical crowdfunding donations as kickstarter so that would be something the person creating the proposal would need to include in his proposal. I do plan on implementing something like that though where donors who do not wish to wait around to make decisions on the final outcome would be able to essentially give their bitcoins to people who are involved, similar to dynamic distributed democracy where instead of voting on every single topic you give your vote to someone you trust who then goes on to vote on that topic. It would take either a considerably obsessive personality on the verge of insanity to spend so many hours of every day on a website that supports something you do not like.I give him the benefit of the doubt to say that he is being paid for it. That, at least, would make a modicum of sense. Miners are still mining at the price of $265/BTC.Bears would have you believe that those miners that are "selling all of their bitcoin to pay for electricity" now will be selling all of their bitcoins to pay for electricity when the price is $2650/BTC.The numbers obviously do not add up, if they can mine now at this price then they can mine and hold at a higher price. Hell, I'm fine with all of the weak hands dumping their coins and sticking with their fiat as long as I can still use it at its current usefulness. More innovation is just a bonus at this point.I don't encourage people to get into Bitcoin unless I know they actually understand the usefulness of it. The Obama/Romney voters who think everything is just fine can stick with their fiat. I just don't get it. Why would you sell so low?And why buy bitcoins in the first place if you just planned on selling low? In other words, there are bigger forces at work here. Some big industries do not want to lose to the better technology of Bitcoin and are willing to pay trolls to save their soon to be extinct technology.The first copy machines were destroyed in the middle of the night by professional scribes. It happens with every technological advance. On my BitPools site I provide a way for people to prove that they hold bitcoins. The great thing about Bitcoin is that the technology makes this possible.I could easily use the code behind that and make a public API for forum admins or reddit to use so that certain threads are only open to Bitcoin users. The bitcointalk speculation thread is full of people purposefully trying to destroy Bitcoin, reddit has its Buttcoin people who's full time job is to try to take down Bitcoin. I have no idea why, but it would be nice to have a conversation about Bitcoin and not be inundated by these losers butting in with their full time job of trying to get people to not use Bitcoin (for whatever retarded reason). A 1 bitcoin minimum would filter out most of these people, and increased levels for even more clean discussion would be nice. Oh thank you kind sir for saving us all! Oh almighty bear, you are so wise and ever magnificent, what other wise advice do you have for us misguided fools? I am on the edge of my seat waiting for your wisdom.Should I put all of my dollars under my bed or in my mattress? What is the best fiat buying strategy? Do you know Janet Yellen personally? Do you worship her currency just because she is so hot and you want to get into her pants? What will you do with all of your earnings? This:
I believe Satoshi is an INTJ like me where the personality type tends to obsess over finding a solution to a problem, then once it is found there is no more need to think about it anymore. Move on to the next problem. His next project could be something completely different, maybe he gets water in his back yard every year during heavy rains and he has come up with some new way of making drainage simple, who knows, it can be anything. Red rocket red rocket red rocket! That's exactly how it works, I provide a receive address to bitwage.co and can change it if I want.Yes, to any IRS agent reading this I do all of my taxes, especially when using localbitcoins.Actually, for me it is fairly different. I live overseas so I do not pay income tax up to my first $100k of income. I live in Germany where Capital gains on bitcoins is zero after a year. So I can buy and hold all year with these coins and spend my other coins. Simple enough to keep track of with one address for income. I can just change addresses in a year and start spending this income.Actually, I do have a mortgage on a house I own in the US that is being rented. The rent goes to my bank account which I send to the mortgage company each month. I need to figure out this last piece of the puzzle. Australia already has a Bitcoin bill pay company, hopefully someone in the US sets one up.I pay cash for my rent here which includes utilities, so all I need money for is food and gas. Converting Bitcoins to euros is a lot cheaper than dollars to euros. Are you able to split your direct deposits between bank accounts? If so you can split it 10-20%, it goes by your direct deposit.There are no fees though when I was paid the price was around $316 on Bitstamp and they paid me based on $319 so they may be adding 1% to their base price.I have no idea about the employer using their service. As an employee my employer has no idea that I am being paid in Bitcoin. Well I am the admin for BitPools so drop me a PM if you'd like.  http://www.bitcoinstarter.com has a lot of crowd funding campaignshttp://www.bitpools.com has many crowd funding projects Even if Bitcoin drops to $1 I have another paycheck coming in 2 weeks so...no biggie. Like I said, I sell on localbitcoins to get cash so I always have some spending money. The service was great. They have an online chat, I brought many complications with me because my phone number is German but I get paid in the US. They require phone verification but I doubt they did any testing with overseas numbers so they had to fix a few things to get my account working. They're still in Beta so I expected a few bumps but am surprised at how well it works. The linear price should be around $350. Buy now while we are below the trend line.It is not like you can just wait for it to come back down if it jumps up. If you bought at the trend line at $125 in October of 2013 you would have had to wait a year for it to return to normal with the price over $300.It may hover below the trend line for a while too, but it will go back up. It's not like development of new Bitcoin companies and solutions is going to stop. I work for General Dynamics, a company that is suckling on the US government's teet. They would never risk their sweet military industrial complex relationship with the government by accepting bitcoins. I use bitwage.co (I do not work for them, just happy that I can get paid in Bitcoin).I set up my direct deposit to the account number they provided me and my last paycheck it was all converted to bitcoins automatically. My bank never saw a penny of my paycheck. That is the first step in dumping my bank forever.For spending money I usually sell on localbitcoins for a profit anyway so I always have some cash on hand. And pretty much anything I want online can be paid in Bitcoin. Another change to the filing.I put the release at 1 year from the final change. So it looks like 2016 will be the big year for the Bitcoin price.A year to buy while the price is low. You could have replaced the word Greece with "United States", the parties with "Democrat" and "Republican", the same types of financial elite, corrupt banks, etc..The United States will not adopt Bitcoin either.The people of the United States can though. The people of Greece can as well. If people are not technical enough...then they can stick to their corruption. Bitcoin allows people to leave that all behind. VanityGen generates random numbers. These all already exist.VanityGen does not do anything.You need to send bitcoin to an address for that address to be put into use on the blockchain.You could generate a billion addresses per second, they would not go onto the blockchain. I have had my highest buy of .05 bitcoins at 257.81 euro for over a week. Finally all of the buys above it are gone and it's been sitting there all day along with a lot of small buys down to 256.300 USD = 250 euro right now   BUY at $302.50.33058 100/316.37 not 316.37/1000 high$321.13 USDlow$315.76 USDCurrent: $316.75https://bitcoinaverage.com Yet another buy below the day's low. You have a talent, use it. This place is a treasure trove of ideas but short on execution. Go to the Project Discussion forum and read through a few projects going on, contribute to one of those. Or, take your specialty at work and figure out how it can be done better with bitcoins. It is like someone asking in 1995 how they can contribute to the Internet to make it better because they like the concept. The Internet did not need much development itself, it needed people to take their real world talents and put them on the Internet. Whether this was the pet shop owner deciding to make an online store or a computer programmer helping people make web pages. The Internet did not need pet shop owners continuing their pet store business while on the side learning TCP/IP routing protocols to maximize efficiency of the network.Transform your career to use bitcoin so that it is not a side thing. Well done.
Ahh...good catch. It seemed unreasonably high. The https://bitcoinaverage.com/ site is $385 at the moment. It includes the high Euro prices. Credit card confirmations take 180 days. The latest movie excuse for filling story holes is referring to "infinite parallel universes". They bring in little changes in modern time or some person has one thing in his life that is different in the parallel universe or whatever the story is.But infinite parallel universes would have so many universes where the beginning of time, an atom is in a different position, our reality would be the same in so many of them because an atom might be moved in some galaxy on the other side of the universe so to us there would be so many mirror image universes that it would not even be interesting. And why is the focus always on some universe that was exactly the same as the other universe for millions of years until 50 years ago the atoms are different enough where some guy didn't get into the airplane or didn't break up with his girlfriend or whichever. There would be no way to even find a parallel universe that just affects Earth in the past 100 years. You are literally searching through an infinite amount of universes.I call BS on the notion of infinite parallel universes, or at least the movie portrayal of them as a shortcut for explaining the story. I for one welcome our cheap coin masters. Here's mine  c28025710166.b0-0.a28025710166?You're mad man! Quite cool, though I don't understand any of it thanks for giving us a glimpse into the future  Imagine a small no name country with a $1 billion M1 switching over to BTC and then the price jumps to 100x over the course of a few years.I ran for my water company's (our company was a co-op) board of directors back when BTC was worth under $10, one thing I was going to implement was accepting Bitcoin as payment (the only way to pay was to go to the water company office with cash or a check). Their annual budget was under $1 million. Imagine if they had gotten $10,000 worth of payments in Bitcoin that year. They would have doubled their budget just from those few payments.Aside from price though, a country could be transparent with their spending and be assured that their money was going toward projects that they said they were going toward. I am satisfied with Bitronichtech.netBut ya...service is not different just because they accept Bitcoin. But I do like that at any time I could stop my service by simply not paying my monthly bill (instead of going through a process to get it stopped, and they keep charging my credit card). I know many people have projects they plan on bringing out this next year. How about giving us all a sneak peak of what you have in the works?   I've been using hitbtc, but they just updated their verification again and I'm no longer verified. Has anyone gotten past their latest verification steps? It shows a questionnaire but no way to submit your answers. I just went on Coinbase and noticed they are now available in Switzerland You might want to check that out. When gold was the currency there were loans. Even fractional reserve loans.Lender has 1 oz of gold. He issues a certificate to 10 different people in the amount of 1 oz of gold. People use those certificates as if they are money. At some point someone can claim their 1 oz of gold but they count on not many people doing so.Bitcoin company issues a Bitcoin credit card, they have 1 BTC and offer 1 BTC worth of credit to 10 different people. The person uses his Bitcoin credit card wherever that credit card is accepted. The merchant then gets a "credit" for however many bitcoins were spent on their merchant account (just a value in the database). The merchant can withdraw their bitcoins or use their own Bitcoin credit card to make further purchases.They rely on not everyone wanting to take their bitcoins out at once. Otherwise they are screwed, that is why a bank run was always such a big deal to banks...in Mary Poppins they gave a glimpse of what would happen if people wanted their money from the bank all at once.When it comes to credit limits and whether people pay the bitcoins back, they would be subject to the same credit rating as other credit cards. If you're late, your credit score goes down. May Satoshinta leave many bitcoins in your wallet on Christmas morning. People still use land lines. Mobile phones did not completely replace them. There will still be the holdouts and the niches that still use fiat. Nobody.We all lose. Interesting, though it would be hard to play off making a documentary about an NSA agent  Not it's not.Locked. I know before they started blocking the site in Germany, guys in the Stuttgart area were charging at least 20% per transaction.Why not just jump on localbitcoins and check out the competition? I started offering 10% and had someone contact me almost daily, some driving hours. Of course, my competitors started dropping their prices.
Did you read the OP? It is already here. My company would never pay out in Bitcoin but with bitwage.co it doesn't have to.  They're getting their PayPal pro accounts shut down (the accounts that allow you to accept credit cards)  We are the crazy ones.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjYbDnTshHw You want to know the easiest way to have a bank account in several different countries?BTC <-- Apparently the government via the banks is trying to stop businesses they do not like by shutting off their payment processors and bank accounts.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_PointThe following industries were on the list:    Ammunition Sales    Cable Box De-scramblers    Coin Dealers    Credit Card Schemes    Credit Repair Services    Dating Services    Debt Consolidation Scams    Drug Paraphernalia    Escort Services    Firearms Sales    Fireworks Sales    Get Rich Products    Government Grants    Home-Based Charities    Life-Time Guarantees    Life-Time Memberships    Lottery Sales    Mailing Lists/Personal Info    Money Transfer Networks    On-line Gambling    Payday Loans    Pharmaceutical Sales    Ponzi Schemes    Pornography    Pyramid-Type Sales    Racist Materials    Surveillance Equipment    Telemarketing    Tobacco Sales    Travel ClubsAny thoughts on a solution to these merchants getting cut off from the banking system?  I heard it is because of the Chinese Yuan flu. People are catching the virus from the Yuan and they usually die within a few days.My cousin told me, he's from Japan which is the same thing. Which is sad since you can cut your spending by 10% for 5 months and you'll be one paycheck ahead (if you get paid every 2 weeks). Considering the amount of junk is under people's Christmas trees right now, they can afford to live on 10% less for a few months to get ahead.I am glad that Bitcoin will incentivise people to save as opposed to the dollar that incentives spending as quickly as possible. Looking at the chart, the worst currencies are from the countries that "banned" Bitcoin. Risk brings reward. It was risky to buy an untested set of bits that was being called a currency when the price was worth less than $10 each.Worst case scenario, the price drops to $10 within a few days...that would mean that the next paycheck I would be buying bitcoins at $10. I might have to delay some spending for 2 weeks. But I don't live paycheck to paycheck. So it really wouldn't matter for me. This is the doomsday that I see most likely happening. When our debt bubble cannot pop, there will be consequences that are hard to predict. In my almost 2 decades as a computer programmer I have never once delved into the world of hacking. No moral reason, just not something ever I felt like doing. Nice idea, poor execution.Too much "universe" and "sentient". Not so much a declaration of independence as it is "look at me, I'm talking about us being sentient beings in the universe". Remember the worst currency for 2013?Ya, they didn't report on that. Throughout history there are several cases of localized collapse of civilization. Can you point to an instance where all at once, the whole world was met by an event that affected every civilization?I see the US on the verge of collapse so I got out of there. I am in Europe now just because that was not such an extreme transition from the US.But my 5 year plan involves buying a catamaran sailboat living anywhere. Getting used to being mobile and figuring out the ins and outs of getting services without a residence will help. Why not sign up now using bitwage.co?   I am somewhat a prepper.Many people choose different approaches, some look to hunker down where they are so they can "wait things out", others have a bug out bag with a plan for where they will go if something happens.I chose another approach, mobility. I have minimized my life to the point where I can carry everything I own in a carry on and backpack. I left the US and make sure that I am not tied down anywhere, my apartment has no lease, I have no utility contracts, my cell phone is prepaid. Sure, if something bad happened unexpectedly I would not be much better off than anyone else. But I think, just like MtGox, the signs will be there that I need to get out. With nothing holding me back I will be more likely to pick up and move and can do so at a moment's notice. I am becoming a global citizen where I can go to where there is the least amount of tyranny.How does bitcoin help? I have all of my money with me, hardware encrypted, software encrypted with several passwords to go through before you can reach my bitcoins. No need to open bank accounts, establish a residence, etc.  With localbitcoins I can get cash to pay my rent and buy food/gas.Some jews made it out of Germany before the SHTF, some Russians got out of the USSR before the rise of communism, I will be one of those people that gets out early. If you liked 2015...you're going to love 2016. I work in an office full of people who are prime candidates for using Bitcoin. We all work in Europe using euros but get paid in dollars. The bank my co-workers use gouges them on the exchange rate.I haven't been pushy about it but I just mention Bitcoin as my solution whenever people bring up the horrible exchange rate they are getting.There are 10 people in my office making 6 figure incomes. A few of them have started to show interest so I pointed them to the exchanges I use and will let them do their research. I am sure by the end of 2015 most of them will get a portion of their checks in bitcoin for their local expenses. And we're just one office in a building of hundreds. I am sure when all of the taxes of future generations are going just to pay the interest on the debt they will be happy that gas prices went down for a while due to OPEC losing its stranglehold thanks to shale oil outputs and the dollar lost enough value to prop up the stock market.
How is it different if a miner pays $325 in equipment/electricity/rent/etc. for a bitcoin and a HODLer pays $325 for a bitcoin? All of the sudden because of "ASICS" the miner is more likely to sell for fiat than anyone else who buys a bitcoin? Is there some mentality among miners where they got into Bitcoin because they don't believe in Bitcoin?There is no difference. If I can go out now and buy a USB ASIC that costs $250 plus $75 in electricity throughout the lifetime of the hardware but it yeilds me 1 bitcoin, how is that any different from me going out and paying $325 for a bitcoin? Am I going to sell that 1 bitcoin because I mined it? That is the premise that is all screwed up. For all of the people trying to find ways to keep bitcoin going or make it mainstream or whichever, there are people like you and me who use it and are using it for its advantages. I don't care what other people do with it, just don't take away what it can already do, which is a lot.For me, getting my USD to Euro is so much easier and cheaper than going through the banks. I could get my dollars into my bank account and then go to my bank account, find out how much my income was for that paycheck, then go to Coinbase then buy the bitcoins for the amount in my bank account.Or, skip the bank, have my paycheck go straight to bitcoins and not need a bank account. My plan by 2016 is to no longer have any bank accounts. A few bill pay sites are starting to crop up so this will be very possible. It will be like the day I cancelled my land line telephone, it was risky at the time (everyone had a home phone their whole lives, minutes per month were limited on cell phones, signal was not guaranteed, etc.). You already get paid in bitcoin for signature campaigns. That is the Bitcoin world...just like the early days of the Internet. How did the contractors, retail workers first start shopping online or using the Internet? They came to it later, some still preferring to shop in stores. I hear the chains he plans on placing around our necks will be padded Quite considerate I must say. Looks like they only do ACH. I don't have access to Fox News. Only CNN and BBC. They can. I work for a US defense contractor, do you think they would ever start paying in bitcoins? Not likely.But with a company like bitwage.co I can get paid in bitcoins without my company needing to know anything about Bitcoin. It's darkest in the exact middle between dusk and dawn.Unless the moon is out or it is cloudy at earlier times and the clouds clear up at that time, then this is not the case. Also if you are inside and the lights are on, it can be dark at different times. Even 5-10% of your paycheck would be a good way to get started. I would not do well. I am only good at spurts of productivity. So I need a cozy job that lets me post on bitcointalk all day until something big comes up while still getting paid  Or you can start one in europe  I have certainly used it for my website to some extent. I hired a few people via Freelancer to do specific tasks. From an employer it is good because you can hire for one thing you want done and not have to pay when you don't need work done. Though from an employee's point of view it is more difficult because you spend a lot of time searching for your next job.I work in the contracting world. There are two types of workers in this world. Someone who gets hired on for a short amount of time to help complete a specific task and someone who works for a company that gets contracts and assigns it to their employees. The person who works short term for specific tasks tends to get paid about 2 or 3 times the amount of the regular employee, but they also have to take on the risk of not finding another contract, paying for their own health care, retirement, etc. The regular employee will take a lower pay but they usually have a stable job for a few years with benefits.I don't think too many people would want to work doing specific tasks. But with the low employment rate, they might not have a choice. I just started using it. In the US most of us get paid via Direct Deposit into our bank account. To make this happen we give our company our bank account number and they make a deposit on pay day.bitwage asks for your payroll company and some information about you, then they give you their direct deposit number to use. By getting your information, when they get a deposit into their account they can look at the source and see that it is for you. They then convert it to bitcoins and send it to your address.I guess something similar could be done if you use your IBAN for deposit. I am impressed by the way they figured it out. Him saying something does not equal the written law.Obama said he would bring Hope and Change in his speeches. He brought socialism and debt. People getting paid in Bitcoin.Using bitwage.co, starting in 2015 I will get 100% of my paycheck in bitcoins. 2014 was the year of big companies accepting bitcoin but converting those to fiat. 2015 will see more and more people choosing to get all or part of their paycheck in bitcoin.There has always been a chicken and egg problem with Bitcoin. Merchants won't accept it because people don't spend it, people don't spend it because merchants don't accept it. People getting paid in bitcoin will push the spending part.If by the end of 2015 there are 10-20,000 people getting paid in Bitcoin that is a huge steady stream of fiat to bitcoins, setting up 2016 to be huge with the halving. bitwage.coget your salary in bitcoins One of the most popular last minute gifts is gift cards (Starbucks gift card sales are the highest on December 24).You can get one at gyft.com I have an idea for doing decentralized websites using the blockchain. Though safecoin is probably a better place for such a task.
That was me, I had a few Christmas presents to buy. Lead by example. Demonstrate how Bitcoin is useful to you and is helpful to you.Others will use it or not based on whether or not they believe it will also be useful to them. Bitcoin Myths:It's a giant ponzi schemeIn a Ponzi Scheme, the founders persuade investors that theyll profit. Bitcoin does not make such a guarantee. There is no central entity, just individuals building an economy.A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. In a ponzi scheme, early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters, and the late adopters always lose. Bitcoin can have a win-win outcome. Earlier adopters profit from the rise in value as Bitcoin becomes better understood and in turn demanded by the public at large. All adopters benefit from the usefulness of a reliable and widely-accepted decentralized peer-to-peer currency.It is also important to note that Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of bitcoin, has never spent a bitcoin (other than giving them away when they were worthless) which we can verify by checking the blockchain.  I've never really seen INTJs as being leaders. I am INTJ and would more consider myself not so much a follower, not so much a leader, but more someone who takes my own path not really caring if someone is following or if I am following someone else. Ayn Rand is considered an example of INTJs. While she 'could' be considered a leader because she came up with some interesting concepts that several people follow, she did not really seek to rally people around it or actively try to lead them.  We will see a lot of this when people start dumping the dollar for bitcoins.Go with the currency that will hold value over the long term. Enjoy your dollars, I hope they go to the moon! It is better to have bought and lost than to have never bought at all. Welcome to Bitcoin!I suggest you read the white paper:https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf*misses the newbie jail* From the looks of it, if you can do direct deposit, you can use bitwage.co. There you go then, I've never used mobile payments with fiat. Does the average consumer use them? It is certainly an easier way to pay. I hope people get to used to it.I really don't care if the average consumer discovers Bitcoin now or when it is almost too late. They will use it. I'm sure at one point people were concerned about how many confederate dollars their currency was worth. There are bitcoin debit cards already.A bitcoin credit card would not be too much different than a fiat card. There are already companies out there that you can pay your credit card bill in bitcoins, so what would be the difference? A quick google search shows these sites:http://coinsfer.comhttp://billpayforcoins.com/Are there any others? Has anyone ever used either of them to pay bills? Not having to carry a wallet around, knowing that if you are robbed your money is safe, faster payments...Though when it comes down to it, they will use it or not. It does not matter. Those who see the significance of it will start using it and enjoy the benefits. For those that ignore it will have to deal with what they are dealt.During WWII some jews saw the big picture and got out of Germany. What would be appealing to the average jew in WWII Germany to leave the country? That was their home, they were comfortable there, no real need to change their lives because some people have wild theories about their government. Most of the posts around 10,000 were people posting "10,000!!!!", trying to be one of the people on the 10,000th page.But then those that missed it started deleting their old posts so that their post would be on page 10,000. This went on for about 3 days straight. I know, crazy right? I pushed a dollar into my USB slot and opened my Bitcoin wallet and everything. Bitcoins are banned from the fiat payment system.Such games they play. I also heard that e-mail is banned from postal delivery. It is all about liquidity.If there are 1 million bitcoins available for trade and 100,000 people get paid 10 bitcoins per month there is a length of time between when those people obtain the bitcoins and they sell them.If per month people keep their bitcoins for 2 weeks (get paid every other week, it takes a week before they cash them out) then the bitcoins available throughout the month is cut in half. This changes it from 1 million bitcoins available for trade to 500,000.Every instance where bitcoins are taken off of the market contributes to a higher price. So we should be at negative $1000 at least by now with so many monthly costs. According to this website an estimate of people that own bitcoin is: 500,000https://bitscan.com/bitnews/item/how-many-people-really-own-bitcoins-and-why-does-it-matterAccording to this website, average monthly spending is: $4250http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htmThat is 500,000 bitcoin owners spending $4250 per month. That is $2.125 billion per month of costs.Current bitcoins are about 13,600,000 at a price around $325/BTC.So that is $4.42 billion worth of bitcoins.If we are to believe the argument that miners must sell $1 million worth of bitcoins per day to pay for their electricity, then just as legitimate of an argument is that people that have bitcoins must sell $2.125 billion worth of bitcoins per month to pay for their monthly costs.This means that within 2 months the bitcoin price will be zero. A month after that the bitcoin price will be -$150, 3 months after that... -$600.So...can we put to rest this fallacy that miners are selling bitcoins to pay for their monthly expenses yet? Or do we wait 2 months to see if Bitcoin is $0/BTC? Or you could deal with the exchanges...  When you buy your miner you get an estimate of how many bitcoins you will get based upon difficulty. You purchase and mine. You are essentially paying for bitcoins.Who are these extremely poor individuals that know how to set up very specific complicated hardware setup that cannot afford electricity?Why not calculate the amount of people that own bitcoins and say "300,000 people own bitcoins, they have to pay for food, rent, electricity, water, gas, etc... this all comes out to $2 billion per month that people will need to sell their bitcoins to pay for. Bitcoin to -$1000 in 3 months".
Maybe it would be better if you went and held someone up with a gun to steal their money to give away to someone else. That would be the moral thing to do. You know when else the swings were too big? When the price was jumping from $8 to $4 and back within days. Now people wish they bought bitcoins back then but people had the exact same reasons for not getting into Bitcoin then. Make sure you keep 21 in a cold storage you can store for decades. That way you will always have 1 millionth of all bitcoins that will ever be created.Work on getting the rest of your coins up to 210. Then set those aside so that you have 1/100,000th of all bitcoins ever.Then go for 2,100. Mining is just a different way to buy bitcoins.You could deal with the exchanges, pay a premium at localbitcoins, use your credit card on various sites paying 10-20% or buy some Bitcoin miners and slowly accumulate bitcoins over time."Waahh...they have to pay for electricity". Ya...I have to pay the exchange to get my bitcoins. What's the difference?Do you think it's all poor people with no incomes mining bitcoins? My co-worker who I know mines bitcoins has a six figure income. He mines because he wants to get a lot of bitcoins and enjoys hardware and technology. He can certainly afford to pay for electricity without cashing out his bitcoins. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY Maybe look into forex trading if you're looking to make money from currency trading, maybe leverage against the euro and dinar and such.If you want a better currency for your future use, Bitcoin is that answer. Look into Apple and other tech stocks for your investment desires.Whatever you invest in, make sure you're not keeping your earnings in any fiat currency. They will not be worth much in a few years no matter how well your investments turn out. There are many ways people get Amazon points / coupons / discounts. They can easily turn that into bitcoins.Also, for some people internationally there are very few ways to get bitcoins. I know here in Germany some people on localbitcoins ask for around 20% above price. I put my price at 10% and had people driving hours to buy at such a "low" price. This.Wow, that went over almost everyone's head.You can't send fiat over the Bitcoin network people! And you can't send bitcoin over the bank fiat network (try it, I'm sure your bank's manager will be confused when you hold up your private key and ask to send bitcoins to another bank over ACH or SEPA).The original warning was from the Ukraine Central Bank saying they would not allow Bitcoin to be sent over their banking networks (I just changed bitcoin to fiat and vice versa). And yet this was translated by all articles to "Ukraine bans Bitcoin?". Even Ecuador where everyone has been convinced that Bitcoin is banned, the actual law states that it is illegal to send cryptocurrency over their national fiat payment network (not only is it illegal, it is physically impossible).A little lesson: Banks banning bitcoins from their banks does not equal Bitcoins are illegal. McDonalds banning Burger King hamburgers from their restaurants does not equal Burger King hamburgers are illegal.The Central Bank made the "announcement" on Facebook for God's sake...if Facebook posts can make things illegal, we will all be forced to buy kittens and puppies. two fiddy I can't believe I set my buy price at 255 Euro back in November when the price was over 300 and it bottomed only doing a partial trade at 255.I guess I called the bottom. Updated OP again.I was able to get $500 of my paycheck converted to bitcoins. Went through to my Bitcoin address. Next step, full bitcoin paycheck. Like most people I have a tablet that I never use except when I go on an airplane.So, instead of letting it sit in a drawer somewhere I use it as my alarm clock. I have it set up next to my bed with a clock and it wakes me up in the morning with the ability to hit snooze or dismiss.What would be even better is if when I wake up in the morning I hit dismiss and look at my clock and see the price of bitcoin below the time.Not that I would pay a lot for this, I think it would be cool and I imagine it would be a simple app to write. Easiest as far as verifications go is localbitcoins.If you're in the US CoinBase is about the best route for bank transfers.I have had to deal with a few companies since moving to Europe.I have had to send:a copy of my passporta copy of the back of my passporta picture of me holding up my passporta copy of my debit card (I forgot which service required that)a copy of my bank statementproof of addressIn the end I was denied on 2 out of the 4 that I tried. One of them costs me money to wire my money to them because they are in Hong Kong, the other was working for 2 weeks and then halted euro deposits. They opened euro deposits for a week and now dropped my verification level because they upgraded their verification process. This includes a new questionnaire with the following questions:Are you a politicaly exposed person?Are your family members politically exposed?Are you working as an executive staff, acting board member or current shareholder (>10%) of any licensed financial institution?Have you ever been charged with a financial crime, tax evasion cases, involved in falsification of auditor documents or are currently a person of interest in a financial crime(s) case?What does "politically exposed person" even mean?I went to get a bank account. Walked in, showed my ID, signed some papers, got an account.It seems to me that the Bitcoin exchanges are under much more restrictions than banks when it comes to proof of identity. But, by jumping through all of those hoops you are able to charge people using localbitcoins a premium because you deal with all of the bullshit so they don't have to. You forgot to post the bubble pop picture that looks absolutely nothing like our current charts (and is actually encouraging showing us returning to the mean average) Very safe.If you are expecting $10k prices, taking the chance of selling now and buying a few dollars less is the smart move. I'm pretty sure the euro is not accepted on the Bitcoin blockchain either. No, you cannot send fiat currency over the Bitcoin blockchain. I'm not sure 100% on the translation but does this mean that all fiat currencies have been banned in Ukraine?http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-foundation-ukraine-central-bank-warning-isnt-ban/ One step closer to understanding public key cryptography but it still has not clicked.Does their answer translate into a Bitcoin private/public key? MtGox stopped allowing withdrawals and deposits of fiat. If that ever happens on an exchange you are on, get your bitcoins out of there fast. Everyone knew MtGox was not legit and got their money out. Those that left their money on were taking advantage of the crazy volatility going on there. The price de-coupled at one point from all other exchanges. It was no longer an exchange, it was a gambling site.
Most Russians would just buy dollars and keep them in banks in neighboring countries...like Cyprus. My 255 euro buy wall has held for the past few days even while the dollar amount equivalent has gone below that on several exchanges. It's only 3 BTC. I had a hard time getting the iPhone 6 from there. You need to make sure you get a listing where it shows the price in the ad on Amazon. Most of the countries are run by dictators.When your government allows you almost zero freedom, you will not produce.The country that has improved the most since their dictatorship fell is Somalia. While not a powerhouse compared to 1st world countries, it is a vast improvement from its dictatorship days. I bought my dad's Christmas present with bitcoins on Amazon through purse.ioSlingbox on Amazon: $133Price paid with Bitcoin: $104Not needing to bother with fiat: Priceless.There are some things money can buy. But if you want to buy it cheaper there's Bitcoin. Welcome to Bitcoin!You might want to read the white paper:https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf Sell at the bottom like everyone else. Welcome to Bitcoin!You may want to read the white paper:https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf Ya, unless you took a screen capture or video of your account right before they shut down then it's pretty difficult to prove what you had at that moment.In theory they have the accounts so they should know how much they owe. But making people jump through hoops works in their favor. It won't fail as long as I am still alive. So...another 1 or 2 hundred years at least. There are a lot of newbies on here today telling me that Bitcoin is doomed. Should I sell all of my bitcoins and buy fiat or buy ripples?Which newbies to trust? How to destroy Ripple in 3 easy steps.Go to the house of the 3 guys that own over 70% of all ripples.Confiscate. Dump all onto the exchanges.Or...Ripple people can trust that those 3 guys will play nice with control over 70% of their currency. At least the price has been moving. It was getting boring. I can vouge for OP's ex-gf going down speed matching that of the bitcoin price. It's a cold war propaganda piece. Russia Times promotes Bitcoins outside of Russia, most likely in the hopes that it catches on and hurts the dollar/euro.CNBC tries to get Russians to switch to Bitcoins most likely in the hopes that it hurts the ruble.Where is Yakov Smirnov when you need him? There is also the risk of having your bitcoins on a third party client.The 1-2% yearly rate of return you would receive is not worth, in my opinion, not holding your own private key. Though BitFinex has been around for a while they could still disappear tomorrow and you'd be screwed. Yes, the lending rates on BitFinex for lending bitcoins are very low.But it is one of the few places you can securely lend bitcoins and get a return.Lending fiat yields more but you run into the problem where you could have used that fiat to buy Bitcoin and received a much higher return.  At least Doge was decentralized. Even though it has a cap of several trillion doges. Ripple sounds like such a shitty currency that it makes me want to go on their forums and spend all day telling them how much I think they are wrong for using it.Then again, that would be such a waste of my life and I would have to be the biggest loser in the world to go on the forum of a currency I do not like and post on and on about how people should not be using that currency.That would be about the stupidest thing someone could do. Such a waste of life. How much of a loser would you have to be to do something like that.No, I will leave the Ripple users to their lives. If they like it, it's all them. That makes Brenton Woods sound like a tea party.Here's your new currency. We own it all but if you do our bidding we will grace you with a few.
100 Billion!!!?!??? All pre-mined and only 100 needed per bank??? This does not sound good...but they have a cap right? Is it like Bitcoin with 21 million or like Litecoin with a huge 42 million? Ahh nice, so 100% was not pre-mined? Should I start mining Ripple? How much of it was pre-mined? I'm not going to consider it if over 10% was pre-mined. You may want to check out BitPay for Bitcoin->USD Dogs are pro gay marriage. Meh, at least this route you could drop your bank. Not sure what the question was but I haven't been able to buy BTC since August...finally got my bank account set up here in Germany, got verified on an exchange and was able to start moving euros over last week fortunately upping my daily wire limit to 2000 instead of 1000.So this price is pretty sweet.Plus next paycheck I will start getting paid in 100% bitcoins. This. 1 month we will be under 10 euros (for those using hitbtc to trade). Just...need...9 euros more panic...Buys I set in November are so close...hmm...Bitcoin experiment failed? Umm...ponzi? <Insert NotLambChop quote here> Maybe the centralized Ripple distribution company has not sent out a press release. must have So your trading strategy is to sell bitcoins at their lowest and buy ripples at their highest?Just so you know, the Ripple company has full control over distribution. Like the Federal Reserve. It makes people feel good that some "terrorist" is getting tortured. Those people then turn around and give control over their own lives and money to people who can make that torture happen. Those people receive the power, they use it on whatever they want, spend money on wars and torture and use that power to continue to get more and more power. They can then widen the definition of "terrorist" at will to include those that do not agree with them or get in the way of them obtaining more power. They can spin it using propaganda to make it sound like the victims deserve it, making people once again feel good about the torture giving up even more power.Eventually it turns from feeling good about the torture to being fearful that you might come under the definition of "terrorist". Then you are under their full control. By then it is too late. See...this guy probably feels good about torture too.Good feelings...torture works Once dogs prove they are a force to be reckoned with, they will be given citizenship in order to keep them under control. Torture works...if you are the one torturing and enjoy it. Or if you give the orders and somehow feel proud that you are helping your country.It's all about helping people feel good right? Ahh, ok then. You might want to try Mycelium local trader. The things that weren't working last week are now working. I see no place where anything is blocked. Though I did not try to create a new sell ad.Edit: I did notice the map does not display all locations. So you need to search by city. Doesn't Switzerland use Euro?I use hitbtc to trade euro for bitcoins.
The stance of every Chinese individual?Should we start asking them all? There aren't that many are there? Strange, I can search by city in Germany and get a full listing of people. Not even logged in. Nice try....Satoshi I still have my listings up. I did get contacted last week by a buyer and everything from there works fine. I heard he then goes into a 20 minute dialogue about Austrian economics. I thought they had a sale for a while giving a 10% discount if you use bitcoins.Maybe that was another site. No reason to try to reason with NotLambChop. He is trolling on a quest to be ignored by every single user of bitcointalk. By quoting you remind us all why we put him on ignore many months ago. Ahh, so only distribution can be stopped with a single wave of a bureaucrat's hand. Has Ripple fixed that problem where they are centralized yet? My buys for the past month have been at $310-$320...once US wakes up maybe people will panic sell when they see the lower price. Getting close to buying time...I'm not seeing enough panic to buy yet though. I had a dream last night about extreme volatility.It crashed hard then shot up. Everyone was shocked and thought it had to be a glitch (in the dream the price dropped to 0 before shooting up). I went to the casino and saw that Roulette is only good for the rich. I saw a guy put all of his money on 12 and it hit. Now he is rich. Roulette is doomed. Welcome to Bitcoin!I suggest you read the white paper. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf The bitcoins traded for fiat are what determines the price. When the market cap of Bitcoin went from $1 billion to $5 billion do you honestly believe that $4 billion worth of money flowed into Bitcoin? Or was it perhaps a small percentage of the coins on the exchanges that were purchases raising the price? Yes, it was implied in this equation:13,6 mil (bitcoins in circulation already) multiplied by 24650USD (25000/target price -350/actual price) So all 13.6 million bitcoins are traded daily on the exchange? Always assume that there is another person on your computer watching what you are doing if it is connected to the Internet.Plan your Bitcoin storage accordingly. Because there is so little going on I had time to look up quiescent.being at rest; quiet; still; inactive or motionless: A year ago you could've posted that and I'd be like "whatever the fuck that means, are we up or down 20% in the past hour!?!?!" I've flown into DC several times and from the news and everything you would think there's no land available anywhere yet it's trees for miles and miles.
You can do that with bitwage.co, check the OP.Does your direct deposit allow you to put a percentage into multiple bank accounts? Or all of these people who are very wise and continue to gain intelligence will make it a whole heck of a lot easier to start living on other planets, travel throughout space, go to other solar systems/galaxies.People adapt. Look at the major cities. They are able to handle millions of people. There is a lot of empty space on this world and other worlds. Plenty of room to grow. Or the Xapo card. I called the feds phone and they said not to worry about it. I think Theymos is a group of people. Simple, only the top 1% will be immortal. Pledge your cold storage coins toward setting one up here:http://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20Credit%20Union Updated OP again.I set up a test case so that $500 of my paycheck gets paid in Bitcoin. Hitler to the Jews: That's great! http://www.bitwage.coget paid in bitcoin at your current job Pooling with money means a lot of people putting their money together. They 'pool' their money together.Sometimes useful for larger purchases that just one person cannot afford but many people together can afford.Useless in the Bitcoin world since you can send $5 to an exchange and buy $5 worth of bitcoins. Hence why I brought up the Republican primary.Sheep gonna be sheep. Look at the amount of people that voted for Obama.Look at who they chose in the primary for the past 10-20 Republican/Democrat primaries.A lot of ignorant people in the US. Is using Bitcoin easier than this?  This, my buys are in the $310-$320 range. Usually before a big climb there is a crazy crash right before. And if I miss it...meh, that's all good too.Though we have been through so many different reasons why Bitcoin is going to fail and reasons why Bitcoin is going to the moon that I'm not sure what sort of news could do either. I am just finishing an alt coin generator using dictionary words and phrases that will start pumping out a new alt coin every 10 minutes.Do you think this will thin out the alt coin market at all? 1st question: Do you have enough power to stop this entity from kidnapping you (your own police force, military, etc.)?If not, do you have enough money to pay for such protection?Can you seek asylum with another entity which could afford you such protection?If not, there is not much you can do. You can try to be insignificant so that you are just a waste of their time or become a hassle in such a way that they just want to be done with you. You can play their game, but remember...it is their game.The key is, once you escape or they let you go what will you do to avoid getting kidnapped? Leave the country? Stay low, off their radar? Get into a position where you actually do have power/money?Look forward, not backward. Shit happens, adapt. Work toward being able to live your life. Ya, if someone has some valid misgivings about Bitcoin that's fine. If they come on here and say "Bitcoin will never work because..." then I ignore them, they're on a Bitcoin forum trying to get people to not use Bitcoin. I have no time for people like that. I don't go on the communism forums and tell people they need to stop supporting communism. To each his own.
NotLamchop is useful in this thread by being so ultra troll/bearish that all other bears/trolls do not bother trying to compete.This allows for a simple ignore of only one user making it easier on everyone thus turning this thread into the most bullish thread on bitcointalk. This:</thread> The max dog is like 500 trillion or something crazy like that. Don't invest in a currency with such a high cap. Might as well buy dollars. I have some Litecoins and PPCoins. They seem to be holding strong even after a few years.No reason to invest much into the alts though. You can pay someone a few satoshis to build an alt for you. With tens of thousands of alts, their value gets diminished quickly. Thanks. A sig link would be cool. Ron Paul was an example, if I knew more about Martin Luther King I might've gone into that or any other figures throughout history who's ideas were right but their human nature past was used against them to attack the idea. I just happened to know the most from the Ron Paul camp, seeing from the inside a very well coordinated attack. Ya, nobody gives money to google. They give away all of their services for free. Merchant adoption, even if they convert from bitcoins to dollars is all about the amount of time Bitcoin is held thanks to them accepting bitcoins.If 365 people use one bitcoin that goes from dollars to bitcoin back to dollars over the course of one day, that is the equivalent of one person holding 1 bitcoin for the whole year.The longer the period, the more people, the less bitcoins available for people on the exchange, the higher the price.When there was only one option...a pizza, it was such a small portion of the whole bitcoin supply that 10,000 bitcoins were required for the transaction. If there are a large amount of merchants accepting and requiring bitcoin to be held for slightly longer amounts of time, the less the supply for people who want to buy. You get "a BITCOIN" every 30 minutes?or is it up to 5000 satoshi?Also...wrong forum. Keep 21 for long term so that you can say that you have 1 millionth of all bitcoins.Spend/invest/use the rest.Work on getting to 1 100,000th. Could be, I didn't know they had that set up. They could have had bitcoins back then. This. If someone who was practicing their freedom was rude it is best to end that freedom for everyone. Wouldn't want to hurt any more police officers feelings or make them uncomfortable. That's the most important thing after all. Have you ever paid for something in person with bitcoins?Sooo easy True, Andreas spoke about this on the Joe Rogan show. Talking about how people in isolated countries would take their short wave radio and go to the train track to hook up to it as an antenna, send their message then unhook and retreat to where they were before.Flag semafore could send a message long distance over several hops faster than the earlier Internet connections. Where is the risk in getting bitcoins?You get the bitcoins...they can't be taken back. If you can find his hard drive, they're yours: Any transaction made in the smaller network would be ignored when joining back in because the blocks found would be after the blocks found on the larger network.  This.Price on Bitstamp is down $1.  So, in summary:Bitcoin is going to $1000!!! I can taste the despair right now but I prefer to buy during panic...I will hold off a little longer.
it's not known...we still don't know the price Tim Draper paid back in July I will still be buying when the price is 1000+Buying with dollars and selling with euros because it is the cheapest way to move money from my US bank to my german bank. BitPools has blockchain voting.Your eyes have been opened by Bitcoin...why try to upgrade a legacy system?Satoshi did not say "let's replace the Federal Reserve with a decentralized fiat system". He said, let's revolutionize the way we use money.So why focus on replacing a voting system for a legacy concept such as voting for people to decide what to do with your money?What is the point of government? Everyone "gives" them money and they implement large projects supposedly in the interest of those that gave them the money.Why do we need government to do this for us? Why not pool our money voluntarily for projects that we support?Look beyond upgrading an old system. Look toward a new system that fulfills the need of the old system. The question is...could you fry chicken from the heat put off by an ASIC miner?I think that is a question we all had on our minds. A mass uprising by the people.The difficulty to get a block would likely be too high for the cut off country and it would likely take weeks for them to process a single block. So it appears that a Second Market syndicate was the one that got the 9 x 5000 and the one 3000 block.They won 48000 of the bitcoins and Tim Draper got 2000.http://www.coindesk.com/secondmarket-syndicate-bidders-real-winners-bitcoin-auction/ quietly?like nobody would notice? Or what Cassandra was doing  The fool that just sold a loaf of bread for $1000+? Follow up? That is the story we all need to write using the world as our parchment. Or the Hollywood version:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=883213.0 The thing is, markets crash when there's a bubble. With the government...bad things start to happen. No damage control necessary for me. I am cash heavy right now...I had a target price picked a month ago and we have a little ways to go.All prices get hit if you're patient. Time to get out of debt backed dollars? Results here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=887313.0 Have they fixed that Ripple thing where everything is centralized run by a single company yet? And OP is gone.  It was likely the online transfers that caused the most problems. SEPA transfers for bitcoins, I never understood how this could be done without abuse so I stayed away.Cash exchange is very difficult to scam. Though I made sure to read up on testing for counterfeit bills first. Hmm, I use localbitcoins here in Germany to get my dollars changed to euros via Bitcoin.I will look into this more. I still have my sales open, I just sold some coins last night.
Maybe by pooling they can save .05% in transaction fees? Buy bitcoins now.When one bitcoin is enough to run a full country, you can then distribute it equally to everyone.But as it has been said.If tomorrow all of the money and wealth were equally distributed to everyone. Within a generation the wealth distribution would be right back to where it is today. (I will ignore fees and round up to make the numbers look nicer)The 144,341 bitcoins were split into 100,000 and 44,341.The 44,341 sits at this address: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1CaGxqCQv2ofqLf37HCUQoLujzRMaz74LK (presumably set aside for another auction).The 100,000 was split into several addresses:52,0009 x 50003000--------------The 52,000 was split into 2 addresses:50,000 sits at this address: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/12pCPrWvudnefJCtXQUBcm9z2NogtC3Rix (presumably set aside for another auction).2,000--------------The 2,000 was split into 4 addresses:500 sits at this address: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1CqxH3QFXyfZP8MzqGFVXckvKKHyYXCg2y500 sits at this address: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1Kj5DkLFM63GK2XzxwCndmkHotAGJWtbMG500 sits at this address: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1Pwnsg7a3c3ofFUeVRRmCj2ppfvMhpHGTD500 sits at this address: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/12grzLvLPZrVCspZxZWKneH3ATFHMJMXRX--------------2 of the 5000 were combined:10,000 sits at this address: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/39T3BBsiKxeeu7PebckN8ueb7F84iegoZL--------------7 of the 5000 were combined:35,000 sent through this address then split up: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1CvBmeNZY7wgg5fyxfNd6vJzHN6EyhrHPs--------------3000 sits at this address: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1MFz2bnUzPRXUZmi4JaCi9J1Gvgp883mH4Conclusion:I would say that one person won 10,000 bitcoins, a consortium won 35,000 bitcoins, one person won 3,000 bitcoins and Tim Draper won 2,000 and split it into 4 addresses.Of the consortium it looks like they are going into even larger balances so it is very unlikely that any of these bitcoins will be sold on the exchange any time soon.Update:So it appears that a Second Market syndicate was the one that got the 9 x 5000 and the one 3000 block.They won 48000 of the bitcoins and Tim Draper got 2000.http://www.coindesk.com/secondmarket-syndicate-bidders-real-winners-bitcoin-auction/ Ya, I figured since there's really nothing that can be read from the coins moving it would be more fun if the conclusion was TO DA MOON!!!And the price has been waaaaayyyy too boring this week. The 100k block of coins were split into several 5k blocks and one 52k block:https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/e696b24eb87e58c546156ead075055c3c27a8a6b2637f19941d58cb7349eb88d The 100k block was split up into smaller blocks of 5k each with one 52khttps://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/e696b24eb87e58c546156ead075055c3c27a8a6b2637f19941d58cb7349eb88d Chatter is always true when it is on the Speculation forum.I also heard that the coins went for $10k each during this auction. From IRC. Good question, the chatter was on here so I have no idea how to find a specific link. Apparently it was talk on IRC. I don't go on IRC. I'm thinking this week is the week to go all green. We have other people who said they bid at or above market value and did not win. Unless they were purchased above market price like last time. Which sent the price up about $50-$100 soon after. Because of market analysis. Only 2 confirmations.I suspect they will be splitting the 100k address into two, in preparation for the next auction. TO DA MOON!!!(my market analysis)yw 100000 BTC and 44341 BTC moved out of the FBI address.https://blockchain.info/address/1i7cZdoE9NcHSdAL5eGjmTJbBVqeQDwgwOne block is great news, it was not broken into small amounts.Here is a full breakdown of the results:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=887313.0 1i7cZdoE9NcHSdAL5eGjmTJbBVqeQDwgwAll of the coins were moved, one chunk of 100,000 and one of 44341.TO DA MOON!!! The coins have not been distributed yet. Steve Jobs will be investing $2 billion next week. Should be a lot of people there with Central Florida being in it.One bit party in St. Pete. Won't happen.
I signed up for this:https://www.bitwage.co/They work with payroll companies to pay people in Bitcoin. They have hooked into almost every payroll company in the US. Kwanza I already asked my mortgage company if I could pay them in Bitcoin and they declined...I was not surprised. Ahh, I'd only looked at moving Euro to btc-e.Don't most international wire transfers cost money as well? The price likely represents the cost of getting your money in and out of the exchange. No need to pool money when you get the same amount for one dollar as you do for 100 people putting in 1 dollar.And, why would you "cashout"? Are you a big fan of the dollar? You might want to do some videos promoting that currency instead. Is swinging illegal in the US? The price will start around $350 for the beginning of 2015 and end just over $500 by the end of the year.Unless the ETF is announced. There are a lot asking for the price on Dec 31 2014/Jan 1 2015.Considering we were up pretty high last year, the predictions will be very high from last year. The hoops you have to jump through to get your money into btc-e is insane. You lose 2-3% in fees. It looks like the Euro has taken quite the fall over the past week as part of a downward trend that has been going on for about 7 months (price was $1.25 per euro last week, now down to $1.22) In May it was $1.39.The bitcoin price is reflecting the difference with the euro price being around 300 EUR/BTC and the dollar price around 368 USD/BTC.What do you believe will happen with the Euro/Dollar and what affect do you believe that will have on the bitcoin price? No It would likely be incremental.A city in Australia is starting to accept Bitcoin as payment for city services.It would likely happen like that. The city starts accepting it. Then set a phase in time of when they would fully use bitcoins.They would need to use multi-sig keys for spending in the way that their bank account might require city officials to approve something before the treasurer goes ahead with the transaction. There are plenty of people in Europe selling via http://www.localbitcoins.com Just as long as I am the one that gets the controls to alter the price.I swear I will keep it stable...most of the time (except times when I am buying or selling). Earlier this week they tested the rocket that will soon be taking Bitcoin beyond the moon to Mars. It's a 2 and a half hour interview so a lot was said. Joe likes Bitcoin, the concept but obviously doesn't truly understand it. But he said he's just really busy.Andreas talked about everything including the potential uses of contracts and smart property. Joe was blown away for some reason when Andreas talked about being able to send a transaction digitally embedded in other media such as pictures or music. Andreas used the example of sending Skype smilies in a series as a transaction. Joe said he wanted to start accepting it on his website but probably couldn't do it for his Comedy Central show because he has very little control over that aspect of it. They told him since he accepts PayPal he can probably do it very easily. A lot of people weren't willing to drop real money into something that was not proven, they may have thought the idea was interesting but not worth the hassle (at the time) to convert their dollars to bitcoins, it was a much higher risk then than it is now. I dumped $10k into it because I believed in it and I was able to move the price fairly easily and would have been considered a "whale". But I got in at $17 before a 2 year downtrend...I only made it to just a few months before the uptrend.I also signed up early on here after hearing about Bitcoin, had a few posts. Tried to mine on my laptop. The program crashed, I thought it was a nice concept but obviously had a ways to go so I left (that was when the price was under a dollar). I didn't come back until the $32 bubble created some headlines. If you turn the charts counterclockwise....the price is going straight up...  posted in the Speculation forum for...what reason?Someone is shorting. Thanks. That link was completely random.

Loading the chamber 1k at a time as my bank lets me.Hoping for some panic to take advantage of. Otherwise, a skyrocket price is ok too. I heard he is launching an ETF that should be out a few weeks before the Winklevoss ETF thanks to his political connections. Classic This is going to be epic. I am currently putting money into place. It is not as easy in Europe as it was in the US.But I do see this stagnation as a good thing. Once the price moves, it will be all over the place. I am putting a lot of positions lower because I know that Bitcoin is like Michigan weather. If you don't like it now, just wait a few hours.It will be fun. I consolidated all of my 217 kBTC into this single address:https://blockchain.info/address/1JoktQJhCzuCQkt3GnQ8Xddcq4mUgNyXEa Fiat will win.Bitcoin has millions.Fiat has trillions and can print faster than 25 every 10 minutes.And you can't wallpaper your house with bitcoins.Fiat wins. or *be? What would Cartman do with his millions?He would buy an amusement park and ride all the rides on his own.

Price is broke.Someone go shake the machine a little. As someone who uses Bitcoin for that purpose often, I cannot imagine a world where I would be going through a bank or other service that charges me a lot of money.I am still not sure how my co-workers get euros. The only time I asked when I arrived I got a lot of grumbling and complaints about exchange rates. You're better off using that unlimited amount of processing power toward your favorite video game and its graphics. Conferences. Come on guys...hear the guy out. Maybe we can make some compromises?We could start charging 2% transaction fees (meet in the middle).No more anonymity...I think that would be a nice gesture.We could all put our full names, addresses, social security numbers along with our bitcoin keys and put it all in a central database to be hacked.It's called respect for those who have paved the way for you. Try showing some.And we could allow people to get paid in bitcoins from people who don't actually have bitcoins. But those people can get charged 18% for paying later (since they don't have enough money to pay up front). Any timeframe on the announcement? It is today right?Or will there even be an announcement? Thanks for the support folks. I'd been running that story through my mind for a while now and needed to get it out.I would love for it to be made into a movie. I think it would be a fun way to give Bitcoin some positive exposure, especially the parts showing it being used for payment. If it does that, the Bitcoin price rise is compensation enough for me  Make sure you add it to http://www.coinmap.orgAlso, if you want to attract Bitcoin users...show art that includes boobs. 
Oh shit, you're right. Thanks, I'll fix it.  Finding SatoshiLance is an NSA agent mainly stuck to his desk job and tracking financials of suspected terrorist organizations. His boss comes in and tells him he has a field job for him. He's been getting a lot of slack from his higher ups to do something about this Bitcoin thing and they want to find Satoshi once and for all.Lance has heard about Bitcoin but only from the news so he's not too familiar with it. His boss gives him a dossier on several prominent Bitcoin insiders and tells him there's a big get together after the annual Bitcoin convention in San Francisco, telling him to get into that party.Lance flies to San Francisco and manages to work his way into the exclusive party. There he sees many Bitcoin bigwigs, Andreas, the Winklevoss twins, Eric Vorhees, Gavin, etc...a big party with all of the extravagance of a room full of high rollers. He moves about the party listening in on conversations, trying to get any clue as to who Satoshi might be. He brings it up a few times but nobody budges giving him several theories ("you mean Dorian?"...said with a grin, "I think it's a group of people", "It was Hal Finney"...) but nothing conclusive. As he goes to the bar to get a drink a young hot female with a bit of an edge looks over from her glass. "Why the interest in Satoshi?"."No reason" Lance says. "Just curious about the man behind what made all of this possible""None of these fools know" she says with a grin "and he certainly wouldn't be hanging around at one of these type of things..."  as she walks off with her drink before he can say anything more.He inquires with one of the Winklevoss twins about the name of the girl as they both watch her walk out of the room. "That's Cassandra...she's been around the Bitcoin world longer than most of us"The next day he's on a video call with his boss letting him know what his progress was."Get on that Cassandra woman, it sounds like she might have an idea on who Satoshi is. We'll have some information for you in an hour."Lance is standing at the Fisherman's Wharf seeing Cassandra buying some fish at the market. He makes his way over to her as she's buying some fish."...do you take Bitcoin?" she says to the cashier as he casually greets her, a can of sardines in his hand, "I was about to ask the same thing..."She smiles at him.  "We sure do, just started" the cashier replies as he pulls an iPad out from under the counter typing in the price, a QR code pops up and he sets it on the counter. Cassandra pulls out her phone and scans it. "Payment complete" the iPad shows.  As Lance finishes paying with bitcoins she looks at him. "Did you come down to Fisherman's Wharf for a can of sardines?"  "I was down here anyway taking in the sights..." he stammers trying to come up with an excuse, she starts to walk away, "...but I had to buy something here since they just started accepting bitcoin...". A smile crosses her face, "I know, right?"  As she starts to head off she yells out,  "so are you going to the pub crawl tonight then?" his face shows no sign of understanding "Green Street? The first ever San Francisco Bitcoin street, all the merchants on the street started accepting bitcoins. The meetup's celebrating with a pub crawl. 8 o'clock"  "Maybe I'll check it out" Lance responds casually.  Back at his hotel he checks out the pub crawl details while checking in with his boss telling him about the pub crawl. "while you're over there having a good time chasing girls our guys have been working on this, they're saying this guy Nick Szabo is a good candidate for being Satoshi Nakamoto. He talked about creating an electronic currency just before Satoshi came out with his currency."  Lance arrives at the pub crawl, a good crowd mills around. He talks a bit more with other people each with different stories about their experiences with Bitcoin, he sees Cassandra finally on her own and starts moving over to her.  "Time's up, on to the next" someone shouts out as people cheer emptying their glasses and moving on in a big crowd to the next bar, Lance being pulled away from Cassandra as they go on to the next bar. They go through several bars, Cassandra always being surrounded by a group of friends.  Lance is sitting at a bar and finally Cassandra sidles up next to him "so you made it"  "Yep, having a great time, thanks for the suggestion. My name's Lance by the way."  "Cassandra", she extends a hand.  They start talking, walk together to a few more bars hitting it off and getting a bit tipsy.  "You know the Washington Square Inn started accepting bitcoins this week" he says to her with a grin.  They end up in a hotel room, things getting hot as they have a wild night together.  They wake up in the morning happy but hung over. "What a night" he says. "My head is killing me" she responds.  "I have the perfect cure for a hangover" he says as he heads to the bathroom. "It better not involve sardines!" she laughs.  They spend some time together the next day checking out some of the sites in San Francisco, as they start to get more serious.  Back on video with his boss Lance is getting chewed out. "we're getting so much heat on this, I need results or you're back behind a desk. What did you find out from this Cassandra girl?"  "I don't think she knows anything about this, maybe we need to go another route on this. Maybe I can go work on this Szabo guy.."  "Don't go falling for this girl, this is bigger than you and me. Stop by the San Jose office and pick up a scriptstick. Get that on her computer and we'll know for sure."  Lance is at an agency office talking to a techie. "You plug this in and in 60 seconds we have total access to the computer. We'll have access at the home station and can find what we need." as he hands him what looks like a USB stick.  Lance spends some more time with Cassandra, they're starting to get more serious, he really doesn't want to screw things up.  In the morning she gets up and messes around on her computer, you can see on her screen she's chatting with someone with the alias (Satoshi). "I think he could be the one, nobody's ever made me feel this way", "that's great Cass, I'm really happy for you". She closes the chat box as she heads into the shower.  Lance wakes up as she leaves the room. He pulls the scriptstick out of his coat jacket, his NSA badge falling on the floor as he goes to the computer.  He sits at the computer in frustration, fiddling with the stick fighting with himself. Finally he puts the stick in the computer and it starts loading the program. The shower turns off as the bar moves across the screen. "come on...come on.." he fidgets as he listens from the bathroom. The door starts to open. "100%" the screen shows. He pulls out the stick and moves quickly to sit on the edge of the bed.  "You know I was thinking we could go to that..." Cassandra says as she walks into the room in her towel. She stops as she sees his badge on the floor with the NSA seal on it. She looks up at him sitting on the edge of the bed looking sheepish as she sees in the background her computer accessing all of her files on the screen."I'm sorry.." he says, "I was just doing my job, I didn't have a choice!" he stammers"YOu asshole!" She screams as she starts throwing things at him. "They'll destroy him!" she goes on yelling at him.At the agency headquarters. "Uh oh sir, looks like agent Seducky's cover is blown." one of the techs says to his boss as he watches the cam through Cassandra's laptop."Get a team in there, we don't want her to ruin this for us, keep sweeping her computer...looks like we were on the right track" as her last chat pops up with the name (Satoshi) shows on the screen.Cassandra grabs the laptop, yanking the chord from the wall smashing it against the table, smashing it with her fists crying."Get out!" she yells.. "just get out..." she cries."I didn't have a choice..." he continues to mutter as he puts on his clothes and heads for the door."Don't you understand?" she cries out, "that's what this is all about...that's what he did for us...he gave us a choice!"Just as she says that the door busts open and four agents walk in grabbing Lance and Cassandra as they gather up her laptop and start hauling them away as they both struggle in utter confusion and shock.Back at the headquarters they're just getting into a meeting looking over the data on the screen from the laptop as one of the techs explains his findings. Lance walks in, defeated, sitting down against the wall. His boss gives him a congratulations thumbs up with a big smile as the presentation goes on."As you can see she was talking to a person who she nicknamed Satoshi in her chats which doesn't look like someone trying to portray himself as Satoshi, but seems to go through a lot of trouble to hide his identity. We've tracked his IP address down to a house in Russia.""Which most likely means he's using it as a hop, most traffic of hackers goes through Russia" someone chimes in from the table "did you track his computer ID?""Yes, since the Russian hop seems to be very well shut out leaving us no indication from there other than going to the actual connection there...""that wouldn't be a problem" a gray haired man at the front of the table chimes in as people look at him strangely"...well outside of that, we did track the ID of his computer in our Dell database which has a shipping address in Japan.""I don't want another Dorian fiasco.." the gray haired man says "this time we need solid proof that he's the real deal, then we'll begin to tear him down"."Tear him down?" Lance speaks up, concerned."We've tried everything we can against this Bitcoin thing, our people in the media have been trying different things, linking them to drugs, terrorism, we've gone after the price, spending millions trying to destabilize the price to get people to stop using it, nothing has worked..." another man says looking around the room "we need to do to Bitcoin what we did to the short lived 'liberty movement' that was starting to infect the country a few years ago with their message of End the Fed""You mean link Satoshi to some racist comments like you did with Ron Paul?" someone else chimes in"Exactly, everyone is human and if we can find anything...even if we have to create some evidence...to link Bitcoin to something nobody would associate with, we can push that. If he was ever part of the Tea Party...did he ever shake hands with someone in the KKK or even receive e-mail from a white supremacist, we label him a racist. Find any porn on his computers... anything other than Playboy Playmates and we turn him into a sexual deviant. Find out who he dated when he was a teenager, if he was 18 and she was a day younger than 18, we label him a pedophile. Anything so that whenever someone mentions the word Bitcoin, the easiest response will be 'you mean that currency founded by a racist/deviant/pedophile?'.""Destroy the man and you destroy the idea."Lance finally stands up. "Why would you do this to someone? From what I've seen the technology is pretty useful. It's not hurting anyone, just giving a few people another option for making payments""That's all you think this is?" The gray haired man stands up. "Everything that keeps this country going is built around the dollar. The whole reason for American dominance in the world falls on the fact that it is the world reserve currency. We lose the dollar and we might as well start looking to Mexico for foreign aid. Every attack against the dollar is an attack against America, and this is an attack. Don't think for a second that this is just a bunch of geeks on the Internet playing banker. We're already losing control of it and every day people show they still have faith in it is one day closer to us not being able to put it back in the bottle. This is bigger than all of us. Bitcoin will be stopped!"Another tech walks into the room. "We've got him..." as he pulls the keyboard and mouse over so he can pull up some files.As he does this, Lance moves over to his boss "What's going to happen to Cassandra?" he asks. "We don't have anything to hold her on, if this is Satoshi we won't need her anyway." his boss replies.They look back up to the screen as a picture and name get replaced by a map on the screen. "...alias Satoshi Nakamoto. He's a mathematical genius out of England known for his work with RSA encryption and Proof of Work systems. He worked for Rose Industries until 2003 when he moved to Japan. We show that he lives here..." he moves the pointer to a remote house on the map "...no job that we know of but his profile matches what we have for Satoshi.""Let's move on the house, gather any information you can get. Data mine his computers, check for papers with numbers on it..." the gray haired man says "...the only way to prove that this is Satoshi Nakamoto is by getting the private key for the Genesis block. We get that, and we have the proof. No more Dorians or Szabos. We need that key."Some time later a team of Japanese and Americans in military gear move in on the house, a remote Japanese home with traditional Japanese decor. They move in under the cover of night, tossing in a flash grenade before storming in. They all surround a sole, thin man kneeling on the floor in middle of the room covering his eyes with one arm. The interior is a conservative home with very little technology outside of a single laptop next to a chair."You've finally found me lads. What bloody good it will do you." as he sits down on his chair. The agents quickly seize him, strapping his hands behind his back as they start to ransack the place.Back at the headquarters on the main screen one of the agents at Satoshi's house comes through on video. "The house is secure. We have him here. The only thing he has is a laptop and some notebooks with math formulas all over them. We're uploading the data now but we're not seeing any private keys."In the background you see several large rough looking men enter the room. The gray haired man talks to the screen "agent, you have done a great job. Have your men move out. We'll take it from here.". As he says that several men move into the room to go talk to the gray haired man. Lance can overhear them saying something about Cassandra. Hearing this he slips out of the room."What's going on here?" One of the NSA officials chimes in. "This is out of your hands director. We'll take it from here." The screen goes black as they start pulling files from the computer, the agents in the room protesting.Meanwhile, Lance hurries through the halls scanning his badge going through several doors until finally he reaches a room with Cassandra sitting rather unhappily. She sees him and starts to go off on him."Not now, we gotta get out of here quick." He grabs her down the hall just as the large rough men come around the corner toward her door. "She's gone, find her."Lance leads her through several hallways into the parking garage. Just as they get into his car the large men come through the door. They call out on their radios once they see them taking off out of the garage. Several black SUVs start chasing them through the city. Cassandra guides him down a few streets she knows helping them to eventually get away."Stop here" she says as they're back near her apartment."You're going to your apartment? That's the first place they'll look.""I'll just be a second, it's important." She runs off as he quickly checks around looking for any SUVs.She returns shortly afterwards with a small backpack and a painting that he recognizes from her wall. She starts putting a few small metal pieces in her backpack that look like dog tags. "My private keys, I have all of my money on these"They drive off. "And the painting?""He gave it to me shortly after he invented Bitcoin. Said it represented the start of something big and to never lose it. Head to Pier 9, I should be able to get some help there.""They have him, I don't know why they would come for you. What information do you have that they would want?""They have him? Don't you mean you have him?" She replies, cutting him like a knife."It's a whole other agency they're not CIA, military, nothing I've ever seen before." Lance replies, confused."You think any of your government agencies are actually in control of things? Bitcoin is bigger than any one country. It's global and we've pissed off the people who actually run things. The NSA, CIA, Congress, the president...puppets, all puppets."They pull up to the pier, a cargo ship is loading shipping containers."I can get a ride on here, I travel with these guys all the time. They usually have something wrong with the computers in their rooms, I fix them up so they can get their porn while they're away from shore and I get a free ride. Hold my painting, I'll be right back." She heads off with her backpack.He admires the painting in his back seat taking a picture with his cell phone.She comes back a few minutes later. "They have 4 more containers to load then we'll be heading out.""There's no reason to run" Lance says "they told me there's nothing to hold you on, I can talk to them I'm sure it'll be ok, and they have Satoshi so why would they need you? What information do you have that he doesn't?""I don't have any information. They probably just want me to use as leverage. They must have found out that he's my father."  Meanwhile at Satoshi's house the men are tearing the place apart."Where's the genesis key?" One of the men asks Satoshi who is tied to a chair in middle of the room.He remains silent. Not saying a word."We'll find it, even if we have to tear this place apart.""Look in the floorboards, the ceiling, everywhere. Look for numbers, anything that starts with a 5 followed by a bunch of numbers and letters. Go through his notebooks, letters, hidden panels, hell we'll go down to the foundation if we have to. The guys at Dagger are going through his laptop." he turns to Satoshi "we'll have it soon enough".The men start tearing away at walls and floor boards searching everywhere, one man going through his papers."He and my mom were high school sweethearts. They had me young but things didn't work out. She was too much of a free spirit and he...well, he always had something important to work on. They divorced when I was 5, I stayed with mom."It starts to rain as they watch the containers being loaded onto the boat."They're both better off though, he moved to Japan a few years later and met a beautiful Japanese woman, Zadoshi. She was the love of his life. They got married soon after they met.""Was?" Lance asks."In 2011...the Tsunami...it took everything from him. They had a house on the ocean, he was in Tokyo when it hit. By the time he could get back his whole village was gone, along with his beautiful wife. It crushed him.""2011...that's when he stopped working on Bitcoin..." Lance realizes."Losing Zadoshi devastated him, Bitcoin only reminded him of all of the time he could have spent with her. Even the name Satoshi was a play on her name, he just didn't want to be reminded of the tragedy. He bought a fixer upper in middle of nowhere and he works on it, spending time in his garden though still working on math problems to keep himself busy. He encouraged me to go out and see the world, to experience everything. Life is too short he says. I just wish he would take his own advice.""And all I did was make it worse. They're going to tear him apart once they find the genesis key." Lance says."They'll never find it." She says, watching the last of the containers getting loaded."He had everything at his house. He kept some keys on papers, some on his computer, hidden all over the house. Now that's all been swept out to sea or is under tons of dirt. It's all gone.""But he had millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. All of it...gone?" Lance says, shocked."I'm afraid so. Though he wasn't in it for the money. He wanted to change the world, and he did."As she says that, three black SUVs start heading toward them."We've got to go." Lance says as he turns on the car."No, they're after me not you. Take care of my painting for me." she says as she jumps out of the car running toward the end of the pier.Lance guns the car forward driving at the SUVs sticking his gun out the window shooting at them. He gets the tire of one of the SUVs making it swerve toward the cargo ship crashing against the tie down loosening the ship from the dock. The ship captain sees this and instructs the crew to pull the anchor as he starts to pull off.Lance barely misses crashing into the second SUV but slams into the third SUV sending both rolling. He barely gets out of his car as gas is leaking everywhere, pulling himself behind a shipping container as the car goes up in flames.The third SUV heads straight toward Cassandra as she sprints toward the end of the pier. The passenger leans out the window shooting but gets pulled back in by the driver."We need her alive!" he says.They're almost caught up to her when she dives off the end of the pier. They both get out, looking into the water, rain pouring down as the cargo ship moves on, its anchor pulling up. They watch the water for a little while longer before heading back to the SUV.The SUV passes by Lance's car before it heads off as the picture burns up in the back seat.Back at Satoshi's house the whole place has been torn apart. Floors ripped up, walls pulled down, every bit of his yard unearthed, his shed dismantled."Where is it!" the man shouts at Satoshi. He grabs a table smashing it against the floor. "WHERE IS IT!" he screams."It's gone, it's all gone." Satoshi mutters."Bullshit!" he screams. He thinks for a moment and walks out toward where the shed was torn down.Meanwhile, Lance finds himself back at the hotel on Green Street. "I need a room, and I need to pay in bitcoin" he tells the clerk.Exhausted he falls back onto the bed in his room. He pulls out his phone opening to the picture of the painting. After looking at it for a while he looks closer. He zooms in on two dots with a circle between in the top right corner, they look out of place from the rest of the picture.He sits up and goes to the desk getting out a piece of paper. He draws the dots on either side of a circle in the top right corner."the start of something big..." he mutters.He stares at them for a while, wiping his eyes, they blur into two lines surrounding an oval shape.His eyes fly open. "The start of something big! Genesis!"He draws a line down from each dot."It's binary. One zero one...that's a five." as he writes five under the three numbers. He quickly grabs the phone looking closer at the picture. There are different colored dots below it, slightly lighter than the rest of the picture. He draws ones corresponding to the dots on his paper. Underneath he writes the letter "K".He pulls open a paint app on his phone, playing with the contrast he sees more clearly the lighter dots turning white on a black background. He begins writing out each set of ones and zeros. Writing the number and letter below it.When he's finally finished he has 56 rows of letters and numbers. He writes the full list out on the bottom."The genesis key." he says, sitting back gazing at it.Quickly he grabs his wallet pulling out several cards from his wallet that he got from various people he met at the Bitcoin gatherings.He starts dialing."Gavin. Satoshi needs your help..." he begins, as he puts several cards on the desk.Back at Satoshi's house the big man walks into the house."Everyone out. We're not going to find anything here. He's hidden it too well. But I know how to get him to talk."He pulls pulls the hammer from behind him. "Millions of dollars on software...computers...man power...and it all comes down to a five dollar hammer."He points at one of the men as he's packing things up to leave. "Hold him down"He stands in front of Satoshi. "You'll tell me, I'll even keep your face nice and pretty for the cameras when we show you off to the world." he says, swinging the hammer."But you don't need to walk for them to ask you every damning question we feed them."With that he kneels down grabbing his foot."You can make it easy on yourself, it makes no difference to me. There's a lot of damage I can do before I get to your face.""Where is the genesis key?" he asks, holding up the hammer.Satoshi shakes his head softly muttering "it's gone...""Wrong answer!" He slams the hammer down on his toes.Satoshi screams out in pain as the man stands up getting in his face. "Where is it!?"Satoshi looks forward keeping his mouth closed. Sweat dripping down his face."Ok then." the man leans down putting the hammer on top of his foot. "You know, I hear this is the most painful part. Let's see."He raises the hammer slamming it down on top of Satoshi's foot smashing the bones.Satoshi screams, writhing in pain, the man behind him barely hanging onto him. His face is red, sweat pours down his forehead, tears falling down his face."She's gone!" he sobs, the life drained from his body.The man stands looking at him, a bit confused but confident that he is getting to him.He holds Satoshi's face in his hands. "We can end this right here, there's no need for more pain. Just tell me where the genesis key is, it's that simple." he says as he moves the hammer to Satoshi's knee cap.Satoshi straightens up, a calm falls over his face. He stares forward with no emotion bracing for the pain."If you don't believe me...or don't get it" he spits out "I don't have time to try to convince you." he says in condescendingly "sorry" he says sarcastically.The man looks at him furiously raising the hammer above his head. Satoshi closes his eyes."Wait!" the man holding Satoshi says. He stands up listening into his earpiece. "There's something going on at headquarters, they want you to turn on your radio."The man stands up turning on his radio. "Ya, what is it?" he says into his microphone. "What? What...? That's impossible." He walks over to the TV turning it on.The screen pops up with some Japanese TV channel. He pulls open the menu and scrolls up to CNN."And we're back" the lady says on the screen "with Gavin Andresen, one of the main developers for Bitcoin with us live via Skype saying that he is actually Satoshi Nakamoto." the screen splits to show Gavin in another screen on his webcam from home "Yes Jane, I am Satoshi Nakamoto. I felt it was time to finally reveal the truth to get it out of the way so that we could all move forward focusing on the technology instead of wondering about its creator." she holds a piece of paper in her hand "and you actually have proof, as our viewers probably don't know, only Satoshi Nakamoto has the private Bitcoin key for the first ever Bitcoins created, and I have what is said a message encoded with that key? Is that right Gavin?" She holds up the paper with a bunch of letters and numbers in rows "yes, and anyone can verify it by checking against the genesis public address, and your producer said he would put it on your website for everyone to see, but yes...that does prove that I am Satoshi Nakamoto." "I used the alias at first because I was worried about something happening to me but after visiting the CIA I realized that my fears were unwarranted so I let the 'Satoshi' character go off to other things as I took over the project under my real name..." he goes on."This is bullshit!" the man screams at the TV, Satoshi letting a smile grow on up one side of his face. The man listens into the earpiece and changes to Fox News."This just in, we have here with us the real Satoshi Nakamoto." the newscaster says into the camera "live via Skype we have Nick Szabo who we verified via a private message that only Satoshi Nakamoto could write that he is indeed, Satoshi Nakamoto" "hello" Nick says into his webcam "yes, as everyone knows I had worked on projects similar to Bitcoin and even told people in the Cypherpunk newsgroups about my idea for Bitcoin before I took on the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto..." he continues on.Listening into his earpiece the man switches channels again, this time to BBC. Lance comes up on the screen talking into his cellphone. "Yes, I can tell you now that I am Satoshi Nakamoto. I started it under an NSA operation titled 'One World Currency' or OWC for short, it was meant to disrupt the currencies of..." he continues.Suddenly the Internet explodes with messages from all sorts of people.Andreas Antonopoulos tweet: "I am Satoshi, I am tired of living with the lie #IAmSatoshi, you can check my signed message from the genesis key here tinyurl.com/auf7sCameron and Tyler Winklevoss "We are Satoshi Nakamoto, we started working on it after moving on from the Facebook fiasco #IAmSatoshi"Facebook posts start popping up: "I am Satoshi. Proof here:" followed by a long encrypted message.Bitcointalk forum member smoothie posts a new thread: "I am Satoshi Nakamoto, proof below"Reddit members start popping up new threads "I am Satoshi" followed by signed messages.The man in Satoshi's house drops the hammer. "We're done here. He's useless to us now." he says as they both walk out leaving Satoshi in his chair as the TV continues with reports mentioning all of the other 'Satoshis' popping up all over. A big smile rises across his face as he begins to laugh, and laugh.All over the Internet the message gets out. "I am Satoshi" goes viral. It becomes a rallying cry.As Lance drives out of town he smiles as he sees the overpass spray painted "I am Satoshi".A few days later, the sun setting as Satoshi limps on a cane with a cast on his foot, pulling some wood from the side of the house onto a larger pile he sees a woman walking toward him.She calls out to him with a wave. "Dad..."The EndUpvote if you enjoyed the story:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2oaypw/finding_satoshi/ Finding SatoshiBack at Satoshi's house the whole place has been torn apart.

He draws three dots in the top right corner."the start of something big..." he mutters.He stares at them for a while, wiping his eyes, they blur into three lines.His eyes fly open. "The start of something big! Genesis!"He draws a line down from each dot."It's binary. Three ones...that's a five." as he writes five under the three ones. He quickly grabs the phone looking closer at the picture. There are different colored dots below it, slightly lighter than the rest of the picture. He draws ones corresponding to the dots on his paper. Underneath he writes the letter "K".He pulls open a paint app on his phone, playing with the contrast he sees more clearly the lighter dots turning white on a black background. He begins writing out each set of ones and zeros. Writing the number and letter below it.When he's finally finished he has 56 rows of letters and numbers. He writes the full list out on the bottom."The genesis key." he says, sitting back gazing at it.Quickly he grabs his wallet pulling out several cards from his wallet that he got from various people he met at the Bitcoin gatherings.He starts dialing."Gavin. Satoshi needs your help..." he begins, as he puts several cards on the desk.Back at Satoshi's house the big man walks into the house."Everyone out. We're not going to find anything here. He's hidden it too well. But I know how to get him to talk."He pulls pulls the hammer from behind him. "Millions of dollars on software...computers...man power...and it all comes down to a five dollar hammer."He points at one of them men as he's packing things up to leave. "Hold him down"He stands in front of Satoshi. "You'll tell me, I'll even keep your face nice and pretty for the cameras when we show you off to the world." he says, swinging the camera."But you don't need to walk for them to ask you every damning question we feed them."With that he kneels down grabbing his foot."You can make it easy on yourself, it makes no difference to me. There's a lot of damage I can do before I get to your face.""Where is the genesis key?" he asks, holding up the hammer.Satoshi shakes his head softly muttering "it's gone...""Wrong answer!" He slams the hammer down on his toes.Satoshi screams out in pain as the man stands up getting in his face. "Where is it!?"Satoshi looks forward keeping his mouth closed. Sweat dripping down his face."Ok then." the man leans down putting the hammer on top of his foot. "You know, I hear this is the most painful part. Let's see."He raises the hammer slamming it down on top of Satoshi's foot smashing the bones.Satoshi screams, writhing in pain, the man behind him barely hanging onto him. His face is red, sweat pours down his forehead, tears falling down his face."She's gone!" he sobs, the life drained from his body.The man stands looking at him, a bit confused but confident that he is getting to him.He holds Satoshi's face in his hands. "We can end this right here, there's no need for more pain. Just tell me where the genesis key is, it's that simple." he says as he moves the hammer to Satoshi's knee cap.Satoshi straightens up, a calm falls over his face. He stares forward with no emotion bracing for the pain."If you don't believe me...or don't get it" he spits out "I don't have time to try to convince you." he says in condescendingly "sorry" he says sarcastically.The man looks at him furiously raising the hammer above his head. Satoshi closes his eyes."Wait!" the man holding Satoshi says. He stands up listening into his earpiece. "There's something going on at headquarters, they want you to turn on your radio."The man stands up turning on his radio. "Ya, what is it?" he says into his microphone. "What? What...? That's impossible." He walks over to the TV turning it on.The screen pops up with some Japanese TV channel. He pulls open the menu and scrolls up to CNN."And we're back" the lady says on the screen "with Gavin Andresen, one of the main developers for Bitcoin with us live via Skype saying that he is actually Satoshi Nakamoto." the screen splits to show Gavin in another screen on his webcam from home "Yes Jane, I am Satoshi Nakamoto. I felt it was time to finally reveal the truth to get it out of the way so that we could all move forward focusing on the technology instead of wondering about its creator." she holds a piece of paper in her hand "and you actually have proof, as our viewers probably don't know, only Satoshi Nakamoto has the private Bitcoin key for the first ever Bitcoins created, and I have what is said a message encoded with that key? Is that right Gavin?" She holds up the paper with a bunch of letters and numbers in rows "yes, and anyone can verify it by checking against the genesis public address, and your producer said he would put it on your website for everyone to see, but yes...that does prove that I am Satoshi Nakamoto." "I used the alias at first because I was worried about something happening to me but after visiting the CIA I realized that my fears were unwarranted so I let the 'Satoshi' character go off to other things as I took over the project under my real name..." he goes on."This is bullshit!" the man screams at the TV, Satoshi letting a smile grow on up one side of his face. The man listens into the earpiece and changes to Fox News."This just in, we have here with us the real Satoshi Nakamoto." the newscaster says into the camera "live via Skype we have Nick Szabo who we verified via a private message that only Satoshi Nakamoto could write that he is indeed, Satoshi Nakamoto" "hello" Nick says into his webcam "yes, as everyone knows I had worked on projects similar to Bitcoin and even told people in the Cypherpunk newsgroups about my idea for Bitcoin before I took on the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto..." he continues on.Listening into his earpiece the man switches channels again, this time to BBC. Lance comes up on the screen talking into his cellphone. "Yes, I can tell you now that I am Satoshi Nakamoto. I started it under an NSA operation titled 'One World Currency' or OWC for short, it was meant to disrupt the currencies of..." he continues.Suddenly the Internet explodes with messages from all sorts of people.Andreas Antonopoulos tweet: "I am Satoshi, I am tired of living with the lie #IAmSatoshi, you can check my signed message from the genesis key here tinyurl.com/auf7sCameron and Tyler Winklevoss "We are Satoshi Nakamoto, we started working on it after moving on from the Facebook fiasco #IAmSatoshi"Facebook posts start popping up: "I am Satoshi. Proof here:" followed by a long encrypted message.Bitcointalk forum member smoothie posts a new thread: "I am Satoshi Nakamoto, proof below"Reddit members start popping up new threads "I am Satoshi" followed by signed messages.The man in Satoshi's house drops the hammer. "We're done here. He's useless to us now." he says as they both walk out leaving Satoshi in his chair as the TV continues as reports start mentioning all of the other 'Satoshis' popping up all over. A big smile rises across his face as he begins to laugh, and laugh.All over the Internet the message gets out. "I am Satoshi" goes viral. It becomes a rallying cry. As Lance drives out of town he smiles as he sees the overpass spray painted "I am Satoshi".A few days later, the sun setting as Satoshi limps on a cane with a cast on his foot, pulling some wood from the side of the house onto a larger pile he sees a woman walking toward him.She calls out to him with a wave. "Dad..."The End I played around with this Bitcoin derivatives site for a while before they got shut down.https://btct.co/ There are a lot of theories.Theories supported by evidence become fact. blockchain.info charges for coin mixing services, they might charge for other things I'm not sure. Was this "someone" yourself?And is your name really Ponzi? You should change the title of the thread from "no one in Bitcoin universe talks about" to "is brought up almost weekly by some n00b.Actually you are the second person this week. At least your title was not all caps "BITCOIN IS FLAWWED!". But still about just as bad. I will miss Bitcoin...when it goes to da mooon!!! If it became their national currency, then the supposed law in Ecuador against Bitcoin would no longer exist as the law allows for only nationally recognized currencies to be used on its banking networks. (not that Bitcoin is used on their banking networks anyway)  I use:http://www.coinmap.orgThis will do for now, I can do my own research but a day catering to Bitcoin users would be nice.As much as these companies try to get the business of tourists, I would think this would be a no brainer.I forgot to mention, Anker Klub gave me a 10% discount for using Bitcoin...so even better. USD -> Bitcoincurrently using CoinBase, 1% feeBitcoin -> EuroI use localbitcoins, they charge a 1% fee. I charge 10% above the spot price.End result: 8% profit via Bitcoin as opposed to around a 5% fee via the bank. A 13% difference. (With a salary over $100k, that is significant) Finding Satoshi  Meanwhile at Satoshi's house the men are tearing the place apart."Where's the genesis key?" One of the men asks Satoshi who is tied to a chair in middle of the room.He remains silent. Not saying a word."We'll find it, even if we have to tear this place apart.""Look in the floorboards, the ceiling, everywhere. Look for numbers, anything that starts with a 5 followed by a bunch of numbers and letters. Go through his notebooks, letters, hidden panels, hell we'll go down to the foundation if we have to. The guys at Dagger are going through his laptop." he turns to Satoshi "we'll have it soon enough". The men start tearing away at walls and floor boards searching everywhere, one man going through his papers."He and my mom were high school sweethearts. They had me young but things didn't work out. She was too much of a free spirit and he...well, he always had something important to work on. They divorced when I was 5, I stayed with mom."It starts to rain as they watch the containers being loaded onto the boat."They're both better off though, he moved to Japan a few years later and met a beautiful Japanese woman, Zadoshi. She was the love of his life. They got married soon after they met.""Was?" Lance asks."In 2011...the Tsunami...it took everything from him. They had a house on the ocean, he was in Tokyo when it hit. By the time he could get back his whole village was gone, along with his beautiful wife. It crushed him.""2011...that's when he stopped working on Bitcoin..." Lance realizes."Losing Zadoshi devastated him, Bitcoin only reminded him of all of the time he could have spent with her. Even the name Satoshi was a play on her name, he just didn't want to be reminded of the tragedy. He bought a fixer upper in middle of nowhere and he works on it, spending time in his garden though still working on math problems to keep himself busy. He encouraged me to go out and see the world, to experience everything. Life is too short he says. I just wish he would take his own advice.""And all I did was make it worse. They're going to tear him apart once they find the genesis key." Lance says."They'll never find it." She says, watching the last of the containers getting loaded."He had everything at his house. He kept some keys on papers, some on his computer, hidden all over the house. Now that's all been swept out to sea or is under tons of dirt. It's all gone.""But he had millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. All of it...gone?" Lance says, shocked."I'm afraid so. Though he wasn't in it for the money. He wanted to change the world, and he did."As she says that, three black SUVs start heading toward them."We've got to go." Lance says as he turns on the car."No, they're after me not you. Take care of my painting for me." she says as she jumps out of the car running toward the end of the pier.Lance guns the car forward driving at the SUVs sticking his gun out the window shooting at them. He gets the tire of one of the SUVs making it swerve toward the cargo ship crashing against the tie down loosening the ship from the dock. The ship captain sees this and instructs the crew to pull the anchor as he starts to pull off.Lance barely misses crashing into the second SUV but slams into the third SUV sending both rolling. He barely gets out of his car as gas is leaking everywhere, pulling himself behind a shipping container as the car goes up in flames.The third SUV heads straight toward Cassandra as she sprints toward the end of the pier. The passenger leans out the window shooting but gets pulled back in by the driver."We need her alive!" he says.They're almost caught up to her when she dives off the end of the pier. They both get out, looking into the water, rain pouring down as the cargo ship moves on, its anchor pulling up. They watch the water for a little while longer before heading back to the SUV.The SUV passes by Lance's car before it heads off as the picture burns up in the back seat....---the conclusion coming soon--- I live in Germany working for a US company so...USD -> Bitcoin -> EuroA lot cheaper than USD -> Euro through the bank. So...the passenger shot him or the limo driver (like the title of the video says)?I didn't see anything close to that. I usually book my hotels through Expedia. They accept bitcoins. And I tend to be open minded when it comes to alternative ways of looking at things.But they usually lose me in step 2, the logical leap/lack of evidence portion.They usually spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 3 to compensate.Even in your article about things that "actually happened", they found that the government has done research into transmitting voices into someone's head. There is a huge leap from doing research and being able to transmit the numbers 1 to 10 to the government sending people messages to go kill someone.The government does research on many things, they just came out with something that can "read your thoughts" (if you're in an MRI machine looking at pictures...being able to see your reaction to those pictures).I worked for a company that had spent years and millions of dollars on ESP assassinations and ESP spying (back in the 70s). Just another instance where the government can be fooled by con artists just as easily as other people. His last messages to Gavin... Alt coins and shorting...more incentive for people to hope for Bitcoin to fail.
It started the World War, insurance fraud, the Federal Reserve was under attack by some rich patrons on the boat...on and on.. Pick a disaster...Hindenburg, Titanic, 9/11, JFK... Perhaps it is a conspiracy...against conspiracy theories.Use the formula to come up with your own conspiracy theory for a tragedy that you can think of. From what I have seen, most conspiracy theories go something like this:"Something is very bad. I will show you the bad things going on: <insert list of bad things here>""These people benefit from those bad things: <insert list of people that benefit from bad things>""Something happened that is bad that those people benefit from."<Insert crazy huge leap in logic with no evidence to back up the theory>Conclusion: "Those people made that bad thing happen." If Alex Jones is against it, then it is not part of the New World Order. He is their mouthpiece. The whole "I love the blockchain but not Bitcoin" is repeated endlessly by Keynesians who are finally admitting that Bitcoin is a great technology. They are just frustrated that it will not inflate like the dollar.So basically "let's use this great Bitcoin technology and have it inflate based on a central reserve board that decides the value so it is just like the dollar, the greatest currency in the world!" Bitcoin, being a global currency, has many foreign adopters. A bit of leeway should be given when it comes to language differences. It is obvious that OP is not from an English speaking country. So...a lot of technologies with multiple competitors with some dominating players.The network affect tends to reward early players in a field but they are not the only ones until the government steps in to create barriers to entry. No natural monopoly can develop on its own.MtGox was rewarded with first player status due to the network affect. They dominated for some time. Had government stepped in to regulate, they could have reined as the sole exchange for many years. Welcome to Bitcoin!aww crap...no you're the same guy again...Ever heard the term: "shave and a haircut...two bits"?Currency units change all the time.  Name one that did not become centralized due to government interference.Just one. FTFYEconomies of scale are a myth without government interference. Welcome to Bitcoin!Oh wait...not a n00b. You should know the answers to all of your questions by now.Your conclusions are fatally flawed. I was in Budapest for the weekend and one of the first things I tried to do was go to a Bitcoin accepting restaurant. But when I got there it was closed. I wasn't really sure what their hours were so I went somewhere else.It wasn't until Sunday night that I tried another Bitcoin place (that I wasn't sure if it was a bar or if they served food). Turns out it was a restaurant and bar but I already had dinner reservations so I just had a few drinks. But I saw that they had a Bitcoin burger for sale, I would have loved to pay for a meal in bitcoins (check out Anker Klub if you go).It would have been great though if I could have had a full day that was a sort of tour where you have a few tourist things during the day that you can pay for with bitcoins and three different restaurants for breakfast/lunch/dinner that accept bitcoin.There should be something in every major tourist city where you can spend a day on only bitcoins. I've used purse.io to make purchases several times.There were a few times when I made the purchase only to wait a few weeks to find out that the item was not sent. This most likely is due to my APO shipping address so they probably don't have anything automated to kill the purchase once an error is returned to the user.But I sent a few things through that I knew for sure shipped to APO and it worked. Finding SatoshiAnother tech walks into the room. "We've got him..." as he pulls the keyboard and mouse over so he can pull up some files. As he does this, Lance moves over to his boss "What's going to happen to Cassandra?" he asks. "We don't have anything to hold her on, if this is Satoshi we won't need her anyway." his boss replies.They look back up to the screen as a picture and name get replaced by a map on the screen. "...alias Satoshi Nakamoto. He's a mathematical genius out of England known for his work with RSA encryption and Proof of Work systems. He worked for Rose Industries until 2003 when he moved to Japan. We show that he lives here..." he moves the pointer to a remote house on the map "...no job that we know of but his profile matches what we have for Satoshi.""Let's move on the house, gather any information you can get. Data mine his computers, check for papers with numbers on it..." the gray haired man says "...the only way to prove that this is Satoshi Nakamoto is by getting the private key for the Genesis block. We get that, and we have the proof. No more Dorians or Szabos. We need that key."Some time later a team of Japanese and Americans in military gear move in on the house, a remote Japanese home with traditional Japanese decor. They move in under the cover of night, tossing in a flash grenade before storming in. They all surround a sole, thin man kneeling on the floor in middle of the room covering his eyes with one arm. The interior is a conservative home with very little technology outside of a single laptop next to a chair."You've finally found me lads. What bloody good it will do you." as he sits down on his chair. The agents quickly seize him, strapping his hands behind his back as they start to ransack the place.Back at the headquarters on the main screen one of the agents at Satoshi's house comes through on video. "The house is secure. We have him here. The only thing he has is a laptop and some notebooks with math formulas all over them. We're uploading the data now but we're not seeing any private keys."In the background you see several large rough looking men enter the room. The gray haired man talks to the screen "agent, you have done a great job. Have your men move out. We'll take it from here.". As he says that several men move into the room to go talk to the gray haired man. Lance can overhear them saying something about Cassandra. Hearing this he slips out of the room."What's going on here?" One of the NSA officials chimes in. "This is out of your hands director. We'll take it from here." The screen goes black as they start pulling files from the computer, the agents in the room protesting.Meanwhile, Lance hurries through the halls scanning his badge going through several doors until finally he reaches a room with Cassandra sitting rather unhappily. She sees him and starts to go off on him."Not now, we gotta get out of here quick." He grabs her down the hall just as the large rough men come around the corner toward her door. "She's gone, find her."Lance leads her through several hallways into the parking garage. Just as they get into his car the large men come through the door. They call out on their radios once they see them taking off out of the garage. Several black SUVs start chasing them through the city. Cassandra guides him down a few streets she knows helping them to eventually get away."Stop here" she says as they're back near her apartment."You're going to your apartment? That's the first place they'll look.""I'll just be a second, it's important." She runs off as he quickly checks around looking for any SUVs.She returns shortly afterwards with a small backpack and a painting that he recognizes from her wall. She starts putting a few small metal pieces in her backpack that look like dog tags. "My private keys, I have all of my money on these"They drive off. "And the painting?" "He gave it to me shortly after he invented Bitcoin. Said it represented the start of something big and to never lose it. Head to Pier 9, I should be able to get some help there.""They have him, I don't know why they would come for you. What information do you have that they would want?""They have him? Don't you mean you have him?" She replies, cutting him like a knife."It's a whole other agency they're not CIA, military, nothing I've ever seen before." Lance replies, confused."You think any of your government agencies are actually in control of things? Bitcoin is bigger than any one country. It's global and we've pissed off the people who actually run things. The NSA, CIA, Congress, the president...puppets, all puppets."They pull up to the pier, a cargo ship is loading shipping containers."I can get a ride on here, I travel with these guys all the time. They usually have something wrong with the computers in their rooms, I fix them up so they can get their porn while they're away from shore and I get a free ride. Hold my painting, I'll be right back." She heads off with her backpack.He admires the painting in his back seat taking a picture with his cell phone.She comes back a few minutes later. "They have 4 more containers to load then we'll be heading out.""There's no reason to run" Lance says "they told me there's nothing to hold you on, I can talk to them I'm sure it'll be ok, and they have Satoshi so why would they need you? What information do you have that he doesn't?""I don't have any information. They probably just want me to use as leverage. They must have found out that he's my father."... Finding Satoshi  "I'm sorry.." he says, "I was just doing my job, I didn't have a choice!" he stammers"YOu asshole!" She screams as she starts throwing things at him. "They'll destroy him!" she goes on yelling at him.At the agency headquarters. "Uh oh sir, looks like agent Seducky's cover is blown." one of the techs says to his boss as he watches the cam through Cassandra's laptop."Get a team in there, we don't want her to ruin this for us, keep sweeping her computer...looks like we were on the right track" as her last chat pops up with the name (Satoshi) shows on the screen.Cassandra grabs the laptop, yanking the chord from the wall smashing it against the table, smashing it with her fists crying."Get out!" she yells.. "just get out..." she cries."I didn't have a choice..." he continues to mutter as he puts on his clothes and heads for the door."Don't you understand?" she cries out, "that's what this is all about...that's what he did for us...he gave us a choice!"Just as she says that the door busts open and four agents walk in grabbing Lance and Cassandra as they gather up her laptop and start hauling them away as they both struggle in utter confusion and shock.Back at the headquarters they're just getting into a meeting looking over the data on the screen from the laptop as one of the techs explains his findings. Lance walks in, defeated, sitting down against the wall. His boss gives him a congratulations thumbs up with a big smile as the presentation goes on."As you can see she was talking to a who she nicknamed Satoshi in her chats which doesn't look like someone trying to portray himself as Satoshi, but seems to go through a lot of trouble to hide his identity. We've tracked his IP address down to a house in Russia.""Which most likely means he's using it as a hop, most traffic of hackers goes through Russia" someone chimes in from the table "did you track his computer ID?""Yes, since the Russian hop seems to be very well shut out leaving us no indication from there other than going to the actual connection there..." "that wouldn't be a problem" a gray haired man at the front of the table chimes in as people look at him strangely"...well outside of that, we did track the ID of his computer in our Dell database which has a shipping address in Japan." "I don't want another Dorian fiasco.." the gray haired man says "this time we need solid proof that he's the real deal, then we'll begin to tear him down"."Tear him down?" Lance speaks up, concerned."We've tried everything we can against this Bitcoin thing, our people in the media have been trying different things, linking them to drugs, terrorism, we've gone after the price, spending millions trying to destabilize the price to get people to stop using it, nothing has worked..." another man says looking around the room "we need to do to Bitcoin what we did to the short lived 'liberty movement' that was starting to infect the country a few years ago with their message of End the Fed""You mean link Satoshi to some racist comments like you did with Ron Paul?" someone else chimes in"Exactly, everyone is human and if we can find anything...even if we have to create some evidence...to link Bitcoin to something nobody would associate with, we can push that. If he was ever part of the Tea Party...did he ever shake hands with someone in the KKK or even receive e-mail from a white supremacist, we label him a racist. Find any porn on his computers... anything other than Playboy Playmates and we turn him into a sexual deviant. Find out who he dated when he was a teenager, if he was 18 and she was a day younger than 18, we label him a pedophile. Anything so that whenever someone mentions the word Bitcoin, the easiest response will be 'you mean that currency founded by a racist/deviant/pedophile?'.""Destroy the man and you destroy the idea."Lance finally stands up. "Why would you do this to someone? From what I've seen the technology is pretty useful. It's not hurting anyone, just giving a few people another option for making payments""That's all you think this is?" The gray haired man stands up. "Everything that keeps this country going is built around the dollar. The whole reason for American dominance in the world falls on the fact that it is the world reserve currency. We lose the dollar and we might as well start looking to Mexico for foreign aid. Every attack against the dollar is an attack against America, and this is an attack. Don't think for a second that this is just a bunch of geeks on the Internet playing banker. We're already losing control of it and every day people show they still have faith in it is one day closer to us not being able to put it back in the bottle. This is bigger than all of us. Bitcoin will be stopped!"... Finding Satoshi  "We sure do, just started" the cashier replies as he pulls an iPad out from under the counter typing in the price, a QR code pops up and he sets it on the counter. Cassandra pulls out her phone and scans it. "Payment complete" the iPad shows.  As Lance finishes paying with bitcoins she looks at him. "Did you come down to Fisherman's Wharf for a can of sardines?"  "I was down here anyway taking in the sites..." he stammers trying to come up with an excuse, she starts to walk away, "...but I had to buy something here since they just started accepting bitcoin...". A smile crosses her face, "I know, right?"  As she starts to head off she yells out,  "so are you going to the pub crawl tonight then?" his face shows no sign of understanding "Green Street? The first ever San Francisco Bitcoin street, all the merchants on the street started accepting bitcoins. The meetup's celebrating with a pub crawl. 8 o'clock"  "Maybe I'll check it out" Lance responds casually.  Back at his hotel he checks out the pub crawl details while checking in with his boss telling him about the pub crawl. "while you're over there having a good time chasing girls our guys have been working on this, they're saying this guy Nick Szabo is a good candidate for being Satoshi Nakamoto. He talked about creating an electronic currency just before Satoshi came out with his currency."  Lance arrives at the pub crawl, a good crowd mills around. He talks a bit more with other people each with different stories about their experiences with Bitcoin, he sees Cassandra finally on her own and starts moving over to her.  "Time's up, on to the next" someone shouts out as people cheer emptying their glasses and moving on in a big crowd to the next bar, Lance being pulled away from Cassandra as they go on to the next bar. They go through several bars, Cassandra always being surrounded by a group of friends.  Lance is sitting at a bar and finally Cassandra sidles up next to him "so you made it"  "Yep, having a great time, thanks for the suggestion. My name's Lance by the way."  "Cassandra", she extends a hand.  They start talking, walk together to a few more bars hitting it off and getting a bit tipsy.   "You know the Washington Square Inn started accepting bitcoins this week" he says to her with a grin.  They end up in a hotel room, things getting hot as they have a wild night together.  They wake up in the morning happy but hung over. "What a night" he says. "My head is killing me" she responds.  "I have the perfect cure for a hangover" he says as he heads to the bathroom. "It better not involve sardines!" she laughs.  They spend some time together the next day checking out some of the sites in San Francisco, as they start to get more serious.  Back on video with his boss Lance is getting chewed out. "we're getting so much heat on this, I need results or you're back behind a desk. What did you find out from this Cassandra girl?"   "I don't think she knows anything about this, maybe we need to go another route on this. Maybe I can go work on this Szabo guy.."   "Don't go falling for this girl, this is bigger than you and me. Stop by the San Jose office and pick up a scriptstick. Get that on her computer and we'll know for sure."  Lance is at an agency office talking to a techie. "You plug this in and in 60 seconds we have total access to the computer. We'll have access at the home station and can find what we need." as he hands him what looks like a USB disk.  Lance spends some more time with Cassandra, they're starting to get more serious, he really doesn't want to screw things up.  In the morning she gets up and messes around on her computer, you can see on her screen she's chatting with someone with the alias (Satoshi). "I think he could be the one, nobody's ever made me feel this way", "that's great Cass, I'm really happy for you". She closes the chat box as she heads into the shower.  Lance wakes up as she leaves the room. He pulls the scriptstick out of his coat jacket, his NSA badge falling on the floor as he goes to the computer.  He sits at the computer in frustration, fiddling with the stick fighting with himself. Finally he puts the stick in the computer and it starts loading the program. The shower turns off as the bar moves across the screen. "come on...come on.." he fidgets as he listens from the bathroom. The door starts to open. "100%" the screen shows. He pulls out the stick and moves quickly to sit on the edge of the bed.  "You know I was thinking we could go to that..." Cassandra says as she walks into the room in her towel. She stops as she sees his badge on the floor with the NSA seal on it. She looks up at him sitting on the edge of the bed looking sheepish as she sees in the background her computer accessing all of her files on the screen.... Finding SatoshiLance is an NSA agent mainly stuck to his desk job and tracking financials of suspected terrorist organizations. His boss comes in and tells him he has a field job for him. He's been getting a lot of slack from his higher ups to do something about this Bitcoin thing and they want to find Satoshi once and for all.Lance has heard about Bitcoin but only from the news so he's not too familiar with it. His boss gives him a dossier on several prominent Bitcoin insiders and tells him there's a big get together after the annual Bitcoin convention in San Francisco, telling him to get into that party.Lance flies to San Francisco and manages to work his way into the exclusive party. There he sees many Bitcoin bigwigs, Andreas, the Winklevoss twins, Eric Vorhees, Gavin, etc...a big party with all of the extravagance of a room full of high rollers. He moves about the party listening in on conversations, trying to get any clue as to who Satoshi might be. He brings it up a few times but nobody budges giving him several theories ("you mean Dorian?"...said with a grin, "I think it's a group of people", "It was Hal Finney"...) but nothing conclusive. As he goes to the bar to get a drink a young hot female with a bit of an edge looks over from her glass. "Why the interest in Satoshi?"."No reason" Lance says. "Just curious about the man behind what made all of this possible""None of these fools know" she says with a grin "and he certainly wouldn't be hanging around at one of these type of things..."  as she walks off with her drink before he can say anything more.He inquires with one of the Winklevoss twins about the name of the girl as they both watch her walk out of the room. "That's Cassandra...she's been around the Bitcoin world longer than most of us"The next day he's on a video call with his boss letting him know what his progress was. "Get on that Cassandra woman, it sounds like she might have an idea on who Satoshi is. We'll have some information for you in an hour."Lance is standing at the Fisherman's Wharf seeing Cassandra buying some fish at the market. He makes his way over to her as she's buying some fish. "...do you take Bitcoin?" she says to the cashier has he casually greets her, a can of sardines in his hand, "I was about to ask the same thing..."She smiles at him... Interesting. The grand jury is not there to decide whether or not someone is innocent or guilty. They are judging whether or not there is enough evidence or a case to be made such that it should go to trial.When I was on a grand jury there were 21 of us, a yes vote by 18 people was required to send it on to trial. Of all of the cases presented to us only one did not reach the 18 vote (I voted against many drug related crimes). The only case that did not get the 18 votes was when the attorney general actually said "I don't feel confident about this one, I think I should probably go back and rework this case before bringing it forward again", basically telling us to vote against it.The thing is, the attorney general can come back and present the case later to another grand jury. This is not a double jeopardy thing. And when it comes to the grand jury, the attorney general basically decides whether it should go to trial or not.With 6000 pages of evidence, I would have ruled that there was enough evidence to have a trial. It is not up to the grand jury to decide guilt, just if it is worth the taxpayer money necessary to find out. Get out of Bitcoin into what?Are merchants starting to accept gold online or something?
There is no incentive to improve the roads because there is no competition. Maybe a small square below the Western Union page with prices. On the Bitcoin side have a "suggested transaction donation": .0001 bitcoins (about 4 cents) The key is getting the voting address(s) to each voter.If a precinct has 100 voters. You generate one address per choice for each voter. So if you have 2 choices, you generate 200 addresses.You could even do it on paper, print a QR code and address for choice A and one for choice B.Print those out and have them available at the precinct polling station. Have them in sealed envelopes. Each voter comes in, they go into their booth and open the envelope, scan the QR code and send a bit to the address.Then they drop the paper into a sealed box for verification later.Or you could step it up and put it on a CD, USB, whichever...they plug it into the voting machine and make their choices.Even less secure but more user friendly would be to have each voting machine loaded up with addresses. You keep track of how many people use it and ensure (with people) that each person only gets to vote once. Most secure would be them sending bitcoins themselves, less secure would be the machine having a bitcoin client to send bitcoins to the address for the voter (behind the scenes).If you were able to verify each user online it could facilitate online (at home) voting. There are many ways to do this but definitely not foolproof nor hackproof.  People will stop using the Internet. It's going to zero. I used to leverage at 10x on Bitcoinica.It was later discovered that they actively manipulated the price to take advantage of people with such high leverage.When looking at your trades, did the price move up to just within the realm where you were going to start making money...then shifted in the opposite direction to the point where your trade was lost (but just enough) before going back up again? I'm excited about being paid in bitcoins soon. Making it so I have to buy dollars if I want to spend those instead of the other way around. Sounds like you love something you do not understand.Read the white paper, fall in love all over again.Also this: Unfortunately there is a lot of trust put on BitPools when it comes to the vote right now. The address the senders use is controlled by BitPools, they then forward those funds on to the winning proposal. Though those funds are only held during the duration of the vote.But just like any centralized business structure, stealing funds makes no business sense. Once the vote passes and the funds are not transferred, BitPools would no longer be trusted for further votes.More security would come via multi-sig transactions or something like Mike Hearn's distributed project lighthouse. But I have found that the concept is complicated enough at the moment and adding much more security at this point is not necessary until large amounts of funds are being transferred. When people were contemplating these things long ago, I think most figured flight would play a major role in transportation. But with the government subsidizing the roads, they essentially chose the winning technology to solve the transportation problem. Just like how wireless telephones were starting to come online in the 1930s but the government stepped in granting monopoly status to wired telephone technology (for the good of the people). Don't invest more into fiat than you can afford to lose Another one? In addition to the one announced last week?Like the date in the article. 10,000 pages brought to you by:BitPools.com(tm)**Patent PendingCopyright 2014 10,000 pages brought to you by:BitPools.com(tm)**Patent PendingCopyright 2014 Everyone is in the Wall thread in anticipation of 10,000 pages.again I don't go into Frankfurt to sell bitcoins anymore after getting stuck in traffic because of protesters.So they are definitely interfering with Bitcoin. They are ok with using violence to get taxes. Why not use violence to get dinner on my plate? The point is that when there is a large group of people in a group, pointing out different viewpoints expressed by members of that group at different times does not equate to "bi polar disorder".A group cannot have multiple personality disorder if the group is made up of multiple personalities. A group is not a single person. This should be obvious. +4% in a day is boooorrrriiinnngggCall me when it's +40% in a day American voters are bipolar too. One day they're like "Obama is great", then the next day they're like "Obama sucks!".That American voter guy....so crazy.What? That might consist of different people with different viewpoints? A whole group is not the same person? Huh!???!
It shows in the description that it was about 50/50 Needs a logo of a meme. But if you can combine animal logo and funny name...you're onto something.Combine all three, and there is no stopping your awesome cloned coin.I believe it was Mises who said that a currency is all about the logo and name. Or maybe it was Aristotle.Whichever it was, someone with a -12 trust like the OP is the one to figure it out. Do not invest in fiat more than you can afford to lose. From the user perspective they just receive an option and a Bitcoin address to send to if they agree. A simple web interface uncomplicates things, but there is a lot going on behind the scenes to make it secure and transparent. I'm going to be on the 10K page again!!!soon Wheeee!!!!!  I'm on the 10k posts page!!!!(for the future deletions) Ya, that is key. Getting the address to each person voting. I did think in a government situation you could have them printed out on cards or CDs or whichever and handed out at the polling station. Each station would have the amount for their amount of voters, when someone comes in they can grab from the stack and go vote. Though it also allows for the person to show proof to someone later on which way they voted which could lead to people buying votes.But like I said, it's not set up for choosing your new master. I will leave others to deal with that. BitPools moves beyond that, allowing you to vote with your bitcoins on things you want funded. I summarized it briefly here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=869839.0Each voter is given a bitcoin address. The list of addresses is encrypted and made available. After the vote, the decryption key is released.Nobody knows who has what address. But they know the amount of people voting and the amount of addresses matches up to that number.You can verify the bitcoins sent via the blockchain very easily, anyone can count the votes and you can verify your address is counted. Overview in video form:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY I believe that many people are confused about how BitPools actually works. I will try to give a very simple explanation of the voting portion of it.BitPools is made up of groups of people pledging money toward a common cause.When enough money is pledged, people with solutions come forward with proposals for the group.When a proposal is submitted, an amount is set for the proposal to be passed and a minimum amount of bitcoins required per vote. At this time, a list of Bitcoin addresses is created with one address per user (or multiple if there are more options).At this point, the list of Bitcoin addresses is encrypted and made available to everyone.Between that time and the vote date people can vote by sending bitcoins to their assigned address.Once the vote date passes, the decryption files are provided as well as the decrypted list of Bitcoin addresses.From there, you can see the results of the vote by looking at each address and looking on the blockchain to see if the address has the minimum vote amount.From there, if the vote passes the proposer gets the funds to put toward the solution (or is escrowed). Otherwise, the bitcoins are returned to the voters.Gavin actually suggested this method to me, many thanks for such a simple solution.TL;DR A list of Bitcoin addresses is created and one address is given to each voter, the list is encrypted and made available (people vote by sending bitcoins to their address). After the vote the decryption key is made available and votes can be checked via the blockchain.What are your thoughts? Any vulnerabilities, other solutions this could be applied toward, could this work toward regular voting? you failed! Wall is too big Ahh!!! The price is crashing!!! Ok, I am down to 234 posts with several buyers.Price is being raised to: .15 bitcoins eachWith a good influx of buyers I will buy your posts in this thread for .1 bitcoins each. Exchange coming soon. I have 268 posts in this thread.All for sale to the post deleter.Current price: .1 bitcoins each Solar Roads:Plus induction charging roads:No more need for gasoline.The roads can charge bitcoins for the electricity produced. Who pays for the telephone infrastructure and maintenance?  Remember back when bitcointalk had 10,000 pages on the Wall Observer thread? 
10,000 pages brought to you by:BitPools.com(tm)**Patent PendingCopyright 2014   10000 pages!!!!Woot! How much did the bottle of wisky cost? Fortunately not all are subject to VAT, otherwise they would not have so many businesses flocking to them. Thank you, I hope it is helpful to people.As for schools of thought, I tend to agree more with libertarians, I ran within the party for congress at one point. But I have evolved from there and understand now that it is mainly about power, no matter the structure. We live in an anarchist, darwinist, survival of the fittest world. It is the governments that have gathered the power to survive and thrive through the gathering of power from the people, using that power to continue to gather more power. Each promises different things or puts on different window dressing, but it is all the same. Even without governments we would have people coming together to combine their power and create structures to get even more power.Fortunately Bitcoin gives people more control of the financial aspect of their lives. Hopefully that plays a major role in freeing many people from the power structures they are stuck in. By only thinking of people in groups you take the lazy path forward. Which is ok, many people do not want to have to consider that each person might have their own thoughts or ideals. It is much easier to create categories and only think of those categories and work to put people into those categories.I am an individual with my own thoughts and ideals. I have formed my thoughts not by choosing a collective and then finding out what their beliefs are. I have come to my conclusions on my own. I am myself. Nobody else. No matter how hard you try to make me the same as someone else. I am an individual. I am born free. I do not need a legal and institutional framework to give me that freedom.When you realize that your rights do not come from the government but in spite of it, then you will have a glimpse into what true freedom is all about. in other words, because the state has the power...they can decide if taking by force is theft or not.This is true, otherwise known as survival of the fittest (darwinism). I think I have about .01 bitcoins in my hot wallet so...no, you'll have to pry my .dat from my cold dead hands! I have solved voting using the Bitcoin blockchain at bitpools.com. Using Bitcoin it becomes the most secure voting mechanism in the world.I did not, however, set it up so that you are just voting for a new master.It is set up so that you can vote for how your money is spent, using your money as your vote. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2bOXQibamM So...you are promoting theft. Who will be paying for those state-run hospitals and who pays the private hospitals for the national health insurance? He probably has them on ignore too...like everyone else. Who will be providing this free health care? I was a little worried when it went above $400. I had been selling a bunch of bitcoins locally for some profit but have been working on getting an exchange set up to re-purchase everything.Finally I have that settled so with the price as low as it is I will have a good deal.The price went up on the "news" that a multi billion dollar hedge fund was investing on the exchange. Apparently Bitcoin users want more confirmation before believing this. Then the FBI sale made some people skittish.The price belongs in this range until something meaningful happens. It will hop around because that's what Bitcoin does. solo mine, show them all
Not sure what you are asking here.I deal with dollars, bitcoins and euros.The exchange prices are almost the same with the exchange rate.I have found that there is a high demand in Europe for getting your euros into bitcoins as most exchanges make it very difficult.But it helps to take out what you use to pay for things.Then again, you should not be selling your mined btc. There's risk in every investment. I think it's silly to keep it all in fiat. There are many countries with better governments than the US.Bahamas, Costa Rica, Turks & Caicos, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Ireland, Marshall Islands...etc.Here is a list of countries and their tax rates. Several of which have zero taxes (but what about the roads!?!?).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates Good luck with that. I got out of paying by moving out of the US. Bitcoin encourages saving.The fiat system encourages debt.This is what Bitcoin can do for the indebted. Politician: "Something is bad"Voter: "I don't like that!"Politician: "I will fix it by taking money from you and spending it on whatever I want"Voter: "Yay! I feel better now!" Well, at least this thread has the OP there to bump the thread instead of the thread about trying to get ISIS to adopt Bitcoin.Just an FYI...nobody will do this. I'm more offended by the tax than how they got it passed. You can't blame ignorance and lies when a tax is being passed and people support it. I did it once with one of the alt coins with about $1000 in its early stage.I bought up about $200 worth, which was a lot for such a small market.Then I put half of that for sale (let's say 10 coinz per $1) of 1000 coins at $1.05.With such a 'big' sale, other sellers put their bids at $1.04, $1.03, $1.02...etc...they kept their bids lower than mine because they knew the market would not go above my sell for a long time.When someone puts their bid at $.98 I put another sell of 1000 at $1.00 solidifying that $.98 and more smaller sell orders at $.97...$.96...$.95.Push it down as far as you can before you start seeing walls building on the other side. Then you start buying up coins in small quantities...keeping the price low with all new sellers. Move the big wall of 1000 coins from $1.05 down to $.97 ensuring that the price is going down and now is the time to sell.Once I have the other $800 turned into coinz at $.95...I drop the wall at $.97. The price starts going up...the spring has sprung...the price continues rising, pull the sell at $1.05, other walls fall...the price is now over $1.10. Start selling a few at a time during the rally until you end up with $1,100. A 10% profit with a little bit of manipulation.  Now imagine this on a larger scale with $1 million.Plus they use one exchange (see: BitStamp) to move the price while their main money sits on another exchange gobbling up the change in market moves. Price is down, miners turn off their machines or sell them when that happens. I think he was banned for making so many alt users.Like riiiising. Ahh!!! It's crashing to levels not seen in a long long time!!!I'm selling all of my bitcoins!!!Aaaahhhh!! Bitcoin being used for even more illegal activity. I did that.I can still not like it, from afar and feel bad for everyone still stuck there. You are being taxed just for being alive.With the income tax you at least have a choice of not working. This is a tax on breathing. Dude's a great swimmer.Everything else in his life...that's on him.Swims fast though.  How did he get burnt?He was able to buy 50k bitcoins at a lower price than he could have paid on the exchange. Yet another thread where nobody agrees with the OP but everyone must post telling the OP how bad their idea is. Merchant finder app would be great. I HAVE NOT READ ANYBODY ELSE'S RESPONSE IN THIS THREAD BUT LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT THIS IS A BAD IDEA.
The simplest question would be to ask the guy to point out just one natural monopoly.And when he gives an example of a government created monopoly ask him again to point out just one natural monopoly. But wouldn't people evolve to the point where they become more savvy with their money. Like any time they let someone hold their money there would need to be a lot of trust and assurances. Maybe it would reach the point, using multisig, that the likelihood of fraud becomes so rare that laws would be meaningless.But we are granted a convenience in the thought that the government will step in if anything goes wrong so we can trust everyone.It may just evolve on its own and the laws will become unnecessary on their own. The freedom that Bitcoin has provided is providing the solutions that laws have been providing for decades. Maybe just have the miners delete all addresses with less than 1 bitcoin as dust. Oh wait...http://www.cato.org/people/kevin-dowd"Kevin Dowd is a visiting professor at the Pensions Institute at Cass Business School in London. He is an expert on free banking, central banking, financial regulation, banking history, financial risk management and pensions."Get in line professor. "academics" are stepping forward daily to talk about how bad Bitcoin is. I doubt this speech will get you any paid speaking slots at the World Bank conference like other professors. You need to try harder. But you have many dinner parties to look forward to. The libertarian mantra is usually that the only role of government is to protect from the initiation of force or fraud.But how important is it to protect from fraud? If there were no protections from fraud, would systems not get put into place over time to protect ourselves? Look at Bitcoin and the amount of fraud that happens and the way that the ecosystem is adapting to deal with it with things like multi sig transactions and cold storage.Or like on ebay where reputation can make or break you, if you commit fraud you are destroying your reputation and thus penalized without any required laws.Perhaps protection from fraud is just a luxury we would like from the government but is not certainly necessary as a core tenet.  BitFantasy is more of a game that uses Bitcoin as a currency than that you get paid to play. But if you build up enough resources and get good items you can sell them for bitcoins. And sometimes they have a hidden bitcoin that people can find. I have not played in a few years though. Don't worry so much about stuff...and things like credit ratings.And don't own a car that you aren't willing to just leave on the side of the road and go get a new (cheap) one. http://www.bitfantasy.comFun game, I played for a while.Also, for those that think it would be a good idea to create such a game:http://www.bitpools.com/?Video%20Game An illustration of one company's use of multi-sig escrow:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0-aZit2oI8#t=14 The government actually allows you to go bankrupt and not have to pay back the banks.This is a gift that keeps on giving. I agree, but it goes from people working together to people giving power to this "entity" called the government which they allow to control their lives. Powers that they do not allow other people to have, such as kidnapping, theft, murder, etc..We do not need things such as the Magna Carta (which was signed under duress) to give us freedom. To do so only gives such governments more credibility. We are born free, not even with select inherent rights...we are born with all rights to freedom. No government is needed to protect those rights, that responsibility falls upon you. If your best option is to compromise with the most powerful entity of the time because you cannot compete, then that is something you have to do. But do not fool yourself into believing that you have some rights under that powerful entity just because it was written down once and they promised to stick to it. The fact remains that they have more power than you and that is all that truly matters. Will you be the first to delete your bitcoins for the good of the rest of us? The escrow service is there to ensure that the transaction is completed.You sell something to the buyer. He sends his bitcoins to the escrow service. You send the product to the buyer. Buyer verifies receipt of the item. Escrow service releases the item to you.If there is a dispute the escrow service becomes a judge and decides who gets the bitcoins.The next step in Bitcoin is to use multi-signature transactions so that the escrow service never actually holds the bitcoins but can determine who will receive them. It is all about how good the government propaganda machine is. The US machine is very well funded. But I would say North Korea probably tops the list of the ignorant. I have been to many countries where ignorance is quite common. But the US citizen with access to the Internet and a wealth of knowledge has no excuse. You do realize that this chart is saying that Bitcoin is about People who know nothing about math, currency and investing.It is from buttcoin.org where they make fun of Bitcoin. Don't pat yourself on the back or feel superior to Americans just because of their ignorance.There are ignorant people all over the world. Americans are ignorant of many things.Exhibit A:Exhibit B: That is $4-7 Billion to destroy a currency that would then be replaced the next day.You could spend $3 billion to take over Western Union and dismantle it completely (only to be replaced a year or so later by another company).But why? Just for kicks? So banks can can protect their advantage?This is why PoW is the best...it becomes increasingly costly to stop Bitcoin. Cato is not a libertarian think tank anymore as they would have you believe.They endorsed Fred Thompson during the Republican primaries and they include Bill Gates among their former board members.The full premise to his theory is the same as the many arguments that have been going on here. That PoW will lead to one mining company having a monopoly and destroying Bitcoin.He ignores the fact that a mining company getting paid in bitcoins has ZERO incentive to destroy the value of the currency it is paid in. As has been seen before with GHASH.io. As they approached 50%, many of its members jumped ship and joined other pools.What will be discovered is the power of people voluntarily pooling their resources. This is the overlooked game changer of this generation. Learn from it.
 To answer OP's question of what is 'Financial Freedom':Financial freedom is the ability to trade among others in a voluntary way.Bitcoin allows such freedom to exist. Shifting the seats on the Titanic make no difference.Most people do not understand freedom and are happy being slaves. I can smoke marijuana and that would be considered a crime as it is against the law.  A police officer can exert force against someone smoking marijuana because it is a crime. This is not freedom.You can have finances without law.   In reality we are all free to do whatever we want.And some people choose to use that freedom to oppress others because they can (or because they think it is right, or to get more power). It all comes down to who has the most power. The most powerful can do whatever they want but are also often not free because in order to maintain that power they have to restrain themselves for fear of losing that power. This is how it has been throughout history. Would mainly be for someone that spends a lot of money online. Freedom has nothing to do with law/crime. Finding Satoshi. Freedom is the absence of force. They didn't get my approval either.   There is no discussion here.It is one troll saying "derp derp!?"And EVERYONE else saying "WTF?"Many trolls are learning form this thread about how to start a classic troll thread. There's no news to create a panic buy and a huge rise.We will be bouncing around for a while. The key is to find a funny name or meme. Then it does not matter what algorithm you use. People will use it because it's funny. Honestly, right now we are searching for a price (as usual). I would not doubt that we will have some wild swings over the next few weeks.The price will likely not go back down to $320 as we spent enough time at that price already, unless there is a panic sell.Look at the lows for the past week, we are likely to hit those again. So lowest will probably be in the 370s, $380 is a safe bet.Then again, it could shoot up from here.Do not put all 100 at the same price, buy in spurts of 1 to 5 at a time as the price is dropping. Best time to buy is when people (even you to a degree) believe that this time (for whatever reason) Bitcoin is finished. I assume you mean you are using the blockchain.info API, which means you will be keeping "btc" on the site. You will have the keys which is the same to having access to your bitcoins.Not controlling the keys for an exchange requires a unique architecture which would likely involve multi-sig transactions or some sort of intermediary/escrow service (which would still have some control over keys).Learn as much as you can about cold storage. Use that for a majority of your keys. Only keep on site enough to pay out in a timely fashion unless you can have a trusted staff member who is in control of moving keys from cold storage throughout the day.Cold storage. Cold storage. Cold storage. I cannot stress that enough. Go ask in the alt section. I don't think this has been done before. I am sure they will be amazed. ahh, I meant 20...a number close to $5,000.Either way your exchange should fill a need that the current exchanges do not fulfill.One difficulty is finding a bank that will allow you to hold money for a bitcoin business and your government might have currency exchange laws that you have to deal with. When you start you would probably invest a little bit to get things started. Say you start small with $5,000 and 200 bitcoins. You offer them both at the going rate and charge a commission (~1%) per trade.Imagine your first customer comes in and wants to buy 10 bitcoins. He buys into your 200 and adds to the $5,000. You can have the prices of each of your coins/dollars move up and down so that nobody will buy up one or the other of your initial coins. As you get more customers they will set their bids and sell orders as they like.I have traded on a few small exchanges. You don't go on those to buy 20k bitcoins because you would pay too much. You usually buy or sell 1 or 2 coins at a time and wait for the market to adjust back to the point that you can buy or sell some more. It's not as fluid as the bigger exchanges but the bigger exchanges started small too. Wow...5 pages of people not agreeing/being offended by OP.And the troll trophy award goes to.... Those are all things that people can also do.
He's a coach for Louisiana. Paying for a hotel room on Expedia is great fun. Put the price back. Wire transfer is on its way. Nice...then we spend half our life away from our stuff so we can afford to buy and protect our stuff Not much reason for it. I'm working via bitwage.co to get paid in bitcoins so I'll have that part taken care of. We buy stuff, then buy a big house to keep and protect our stuff, then we pay to protect and maintain our house.Not something people can do with kids but I got rid of all of my stuff and downsized to the point of being able to put everything I own into a carry on and a backpack. It is very liberating. If you need a government's permission on how to use their currency...why use their currency? The only members of ISIS that would be able to understand the technology enough to use Bitcoin are the CIA agents. You put far too much focus on governments. Is this how things are taught these days, government needs to allow everything first in order for us to be able to do it?We are all born free, able to do what we want. It is government that steps in and prevents us from doing certain things.  Not the other way around. What gives a painting value? Does it require government intervention to convert a painting to USD?Like you said, you and your friends can trade things. You can also trade things for dollars. No government required. Ahh...the sky is falling!!! Sell your yachts and limousines!! This...there are 2 golden rules.Never get involved in a land war in Asia.andDon't short Bitcoin in November. A fun thread to list all of the things that governments can do but regular people cannot. Such as:Government can take your money by force (taxation).Government can kidnap people and put them in a cage (arrest and detain).Government can decide what you can and cannot eat/drink/smoke (food bans, alcohol laws, drug laws)Government can force you to inject chemicals into your body (vaccination laws)Government can inject chemicals into your body to kill you (death penalty)Government can balance their budgets by printing more money (Federal Reserve)Can you think of any others? That would be true if Bitcoin was a physical object affected by gravity. But it is not.We may have seen the last chance to buy in the 300s (like we haven't seen 100s since last year). I'm not sure why this would be considered not true unless the CTO of OKCoin is lying."Also very exciting is we have a new client, I cannot disclose the name yet. It's a 3 billion euro market cap client they just do hedge fund trading and they're going to trade on our platform so that's a pretty big institution."--CZ (CTO of OKCoin) If you think because it has declined from $450 that that was the bubble, then you haven't been around for many bubbles.Best thing to do is strap yourself in and be prepared for the ride of your life. I have 5.There is no option for me   Apparently it is a 3 billion euro hedge fund.From their CTO:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4oiQriC0n8&feature=youtu.be&t=4m57s  Weeeeeee!!!!!
Yes, that is what I was talking about. This would actually make a pretty good Bitcoin service. There are ways to add time delays to a transaction but from everything I have seen you have to run the client the whole time.I checked into it a while ago, basically you can add code to a transaction but the code lives on your wallet and executes only if that wallet is running (there is more to it but that was the high level impression I got out of it). It's like getting a taste of what the ETF will do. $3 billion hedge fund company starts investing in Bitcoin via OKCoin. Here is some information on Mike Hearn's Lighthouse project (basically a peer to peer crowdfunding platform):http://blog.vinumeris.com/2014/05/17/lighthouse/BitPools is more crowdfunding in reverse where the problem is posed first, people pool their money together and wait for someone to propose a solution.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasYhttp://www.bitpools.comThere is the point between funding and delivery of product/service that is subjective and is difficult to be handled by technology. I believe the best way to deal with that would be some sort of escrow/arbitration services. One example of a world with no government courts was to have multiple arbitration services. Each party chooses their own arbitration service before the contract goes forward, since both parties know beforehand which services are being chosen they will have a good idea if the person they're dealing with is fair or not if they choose a service that has a track record of being fair. If there is a disagreement, each arbitration service reviews the case and reveals their conclusion. If they do not agree, a random third arbitration service is called in to resolve the conflict. The third party charges a fee to the first two for its services and it is in both parties' best interest to choose a fair service. And it is in the best interest of the arbitration company to make fair decisions. In other words: Rocket train to the moon!!! Updated the OP. Will post more until I am finally being paid 100% in Bitcoin. What happened to my investment in bitcoin? I lost it all. Half I lost by day trading getting it up over 800 bitcoins only to fall on bad leveraged short and long positions during the manipulation days of Bitcoinica. The other half I sold at $12 to put toward a downpayment on a house. So ya...I lost it all (other than having some for my down payment).But I'm still alive, I have a job. I'm still making money. The risk was high and I lost money. But then I started buying back in at $22...$10k from my Roth is a tiny bump in the road. TL;DR  Fight for free trade. The time is now. I read this in the Wall Observer thread on bitcointalk. THIS IS GENTLEMEN! this is GENTLEMENhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KFj8k3jFI   Only invest into fiat what you can afford to lose. I live in Germany working for a US company being paid in dollars.I convert those dollars to bitcoins via CoinBase for a fee of 1%.I put those bitcoins on sale here in Germany on localbitcoins with a 10% fee. I pay localbitcoins 1% per transaction.So, instead of sending my dollars to my german bank which charges $40 for an International wire transfer plus a 3% conversion fee (usually with a 1% conversion rate in the bank's favor), I receive 8% more pay for each paycheck.That is one reason. They won't get me! If anyone had actually read the article, he is comparing Bitcoin to gold. He is basically saying that if Bitcoin reached just a third of the money in gold we would be at $1 million each.Just like it was said before. If you take a % of a huge industry, you can get some interesting numbers.The great thing about Bitcoin is we will be taking a % of gold, Western Union, credit cards, payroll services, etc...plenty of potential I find it strange when people post as if everyone in the thread is the OP.
The hacker?Search cold storage on here for many ways to store a lot of coins.If you had your bitcoins on your computer using a bitcoin client with an encrypted (password protected) wallet then the main way to get that is a key logger. There's not much you can do if your computer is that infested. Part of the first phase of my 5 year plan is to work on getting as many bitcoins as possible. The low price is helping toward that. Looks good, you bring up some sound ideas for building standards. But I feel that things will break down further with technology such that those standards will not fit without it being dynamic which makes things difficult for standards.Things such as Mike Hearn's lighthouse venture (a decentralized crowdfunding technology) or BitPools where the financiers vote via the blockchain to fund various projects.Though your standards would be useful for those projects to help to factor in cases where someone might want to scam people out of their money, it would be good to consider the many different aspects of a transaction to protect all parties involved. Small Australian City Plans for a Big Bitcoin EconomyA plan to build the "world's largest" local bitcoin-based economy is underway in the city of Launceston, Australia, with support from local businesses and even government.Project organizers say the compact Tasmanian city with a population of 106,000 will make a good high-density testing ground for bitcoin. The plan is aimed to cover various levels of the business supply chain, allowing users to both receive and spend their bitcoins, rather than simply converting them to Australian dollars.A notable part of the 'Launceston Launch' plan would be to have the local government, the Launceston City Council, accept bitcoin for taxes and rates. At least two members of the 12-member council have shown support for the idea....http://www.coindesk.com/small-australian-city-plans-big-bitcoin-economy/ You will be missed...it seems like only yesterday you were posting craziness...those were the days.Until 2016 then..

What is this "blockchain" you speak of?Another alt? New exchange? Sounds like you will be having your own wedding picture thread here soon.  Your bitcoins are not stored on blockchain.info, they are stored on your computer (I think).Best bet: Use an offline computer (or at the very least, take your computer of the network, turn off all of your apps) and run vanitygen or using your bitcoin client generate a public/private key pair. Copy that key pair to a CD (maybe 2, maybe just write it down). Do not save it on your computer. Send a majority of your bitcoins to that public address.Also, check out localbitcoins.  You can sell for a good percentage for cash and go back and buy at the exchange rate. Make money off of your investment. The moral thing for them to do would to continue having sex out of wedlock. God smiles down on that. After reading your stances, I am very interested in hearing artifically resurrected Stalin's stances. That wedding looked kinda...gay. Do not rely too much on a USB being secure.http://www.wired.com/2014/07/usb-security/ I lost more trading than I have holding. The bears and PoS people would say that all 1.5 million were sold off on the exchanges right after being mined.They also talk about how low the volume is.So that would mean that a majority of the coins sold were from miners while most everyone else is buying and spending/holding. There is certainly tension wanting the price to go up but we need good news to keep the price rising. People need to be able to point to something and say "the price is rising because of X, and if you don't jump on now you'll miss out'.We do not have that yet and the price will probably meander back down under $350. It will go lower if there is the opposite trigger where people say "the price is dropping because of X, get out now'. I love buying during those times. You didn't lose money exposing the manipulation. You just did not gain money after exposing the manipulation because you pulled out on your own. Probably from one of the many hacked sites...Bitcoinica, Mt Gox, and others.I had 2 factor authentication set up anyway so they could not access my account either way.
An e-mail. Which is more disturbing considering they knew my e-mail address. Though I use that address for many things.

Blake Benthall Other sponsors:CitiBankPrice Waterhouse CooperKPMGIt appears that the Argentina Chamber of Commerce is having a Member to Member event to introduce members to each other, the Bitcoin portion being an "introduction to Bitcoin" in the area of finance, IT, marketing, etc.Far from OP's claim that Monsanto is sponsoring Bitcoin Argentina. Yep, bring back the troops. Parades in NYC and a baby boom soon to follow. Well, it looks like that's the end of illegal drug use.

Currently that is 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes. That is the max.If electricity and hardware costs double....people will not need to open their cold storage wallets to subsidize the cost. So moral of the story...buy every 3 days. Sell the next day.

Comes up with terms like bitcointard. The bet would not be a bad one to take considering I work as a defense contractor and more war for me tends to mean more money. But I would actually pay out the bet as my reputation on here is more at stake than someone new to the site. awesome That was me...someone stole my wallet. 100 BTC bounty for anyone who can get me the private key. There is a false perception that somehow bitcoin price goes down by the cost of electricity needed for PoW.Also...Global warming whackos. 210 BTC is .001% of all bitcoins.This would be a milli-percent.The Mill club?

Does your bank take taxes out of your check when you get your money or does your company?Do you think all of that will be taken care of before they give you your bitcoins? bah...I meant btc-e. Waiting on my exchange to send me a key to have access to my account...I had a dream last night that I was sitting there waiting as the price rose up over $400...then $500... Another Keynesian "waaa....you people with technology are so smart but can't you be smart and make things the same as the dollar?....waaaa" Something easy is to go to http://www.bitcoinity.org and check the sites it has listed for each currency. It shows each by highest volume. Yes, though most people would consider 4 years as long term when it comes to Bitcoin. lol....Gavin pops in for some funny. Millies. Yes, the formula changes each time due to the halving (which was pointed out that over the long term that means an exponential trend).If you take the change from the first halving and apply the difference to the second then starting after the next halving it will be:P = 20.25tSo, assuming $660 in August, 2016...by August 2017 the price will be over $900. This would put us over $1000/BTC by January 2018.  10k people getting paid on average $2k every 2 weeks would bring $20 million into the Bitcoin economy every 2 weeks.  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MythsBitcoin Myths:The value of bitcoins are based on how much electricity and computing power it takes to mine themThis statement is an attempt to apply to Bitcoin the labor theory of value, which is generally accepted as false. Just because something takes X resources to create does not mean that the resulting product will be worth X. It can be worth more, or less, depending on the utility thereof to its users.In fact the causality is the reverse of that (this applies to the labor theory of value in general). The cost to mine bitcoins is based on how much they are worth. If bitcoins go up in value, more people will mine (because mining is profitable), thus difficulty will go up, thus the cost of mining will go up. The inverse happens if bitcoins go down in value. These effects balance out to cause mining to always cost an amount proportional to the value of bitcoins it produces. A sampling of charts. Difficulty (blue) goes up after price rises. Difficulty comes down after the price crashes. This is why mining difficulty follows the cost, not the other way around.When the price drops, difficulty drops. People stop operating at a loss.Mining cost does not affect Bitcoin price. Bitcoin price affects mining output. FTFYIf the cost of mining is $10 trillion per day and the cost of 3600 bitcoins is only $1 million. Miners will only be able to re-coup $1 million of that $10 trillion cost. The ETF will bring the price up. It will not just be a matter of more interest. It will be a way for large financial firms to include Bitcoin in their portfolios. They will consider it a high risk investment but many funds include a small amount of high risk investments in the mix.I am a long term bull, I think the price will go up gradually over time but the ETF will bump it up quickly and then continue a gradual climb from there. Though if it causes hype it might jump up very quickly and bubble/pop again.I think the ETF was partly priced in but the long wait has caused people to move their money out and put it toward other things.I would say late winter/early spring will be when the ETF is approved. They say it typically takes a year. The ETF was submitted last July but they re-submitted it in February. All true.It still does not mean that high mining costs take more out of bitcoin than 3600 bitcoins per day.If miners are losing money, it will not lower the price of Bitcoin. Yes, worst case scenario...3600 bitcoins per day are converted to dollars by miners. Good on ya.I hope you are a great example for companies in other countries. This is completely wrong.Perhaps this is why people think PoW is bad.If every miner takes the 3600 bitcoins and cashes them out each day, it does not matter if the price is $1/BTC or $300,00,000/BTC. They cannot take out more than 3600 bitcoins.The only way this is possible is that if you assume that the miners have a buttload of bitcoins that they have been hoarding that they will cash out. Which..once they cash out...would lead right back to only 3600 bitcoins per day. God bless you is very similar to God is great. Which could be considered threatening...like the guy might set off a bomb or something.
You can:https://www.bitwage.coI have been an advocate of a Bitcoin Credit Union because I thought that this was the only way to get paid in Bitcoin by giving your company a direct deposit number. But it looks like this company has figured out how to do it by going through payroll services (I think).I signed up but don't have my phone for authentication but I will definitely try it out and let you know how it goes. I would love to get paid in Bitcoin. With a Xapo card and localbitcoins for cash I can drop my banks very soon.Update:I was able to get my account set up and log in (I had some complications because I live in Germany working for a US company). Their customer service is great, my problem was sorted out quickly and easily, if you have problems click the little chat window on the bottom right of the screen.Once I got my profile set up it asks for my company name, company website, my company's payroll company and the payroll company's website. Most of us do not know these things offhand and will need to work with your HR. I will be working on this to see how easy it is from there and let you know how it goes.Update 2:I e-mailed my HR and asked what payroll service they use because I needed it for bitwage.co so I can get paid in bitcoins. They responded after what appeared to be a long e-mail chain bouncing around all over the payroll department asking if anyone can help out, finally responding that I need to speak with my specific HR representative. Fortunately, in their lengthy e-mail chain they are talking about the Payroll company they use. So I submitted that to bitwage.co and I am currently in the verification process.A bit of advice when asking your HR department about your payroll company: don't tell them it's for bitcoin or bitwage. Just ask for the name of the payroll company. You can use google to find the website from the name. You can tell them why after they give you the name but mentioning bitcoin is like going to the train station and saying you're going on vacation to Hawaii and what is the best route to get there.Update 3:My Verification level 1 was completed. I was able to do my Verification level 2 by submitting a photo of my ID and proof of address. Once that was verified I was able to get to the part where I enter my Bitcoin Address. With my Bitcoin address entered they provide me with a bank account and routing number to give to my payroll for direct deposit. My direct deposit website at my company allows me to create a fixed dollar amount account and a net account for anything over that amount. I stuck a test amount of $500 in my fixed dollar amount to go to the Bitcoin direct deposit. Now I will wait to see if it goes through.Update 4: Just got an e-mail saying my payment went through, $500 at $317/BTC -> 1.56992012 sent to my Bitcoin address.Next, I will convert all of my paycheck to bitcoins. I can covert BTC->USD as needed. This is the part where we have a disconnect. Like I said, mining could cost $10 trillion per day but the miners cannot take more than the value of 3600 bitcoins per day (currently just over $1 million). This is the limit to the cost of mining on the price.We already know that new money needs to flow in to account for the 3600 bitcoins per day. That is factored into the price. It does improve the higher the hashrate. Bitcoin becomes even more secure the higher the hashrate. Security is a huge benefit that is desired in a currency.Again...there is a maximum amount that PoW takes out of the system. 3600 bitcoins per day. Even if PoW costs $10 trillion per day, miners will not be taking more than 3600 bitcoins per day. This number is a known increase in inflation known since the beginning of Bitcoin. We all know that the maximum will be 21 million bitcoins and that currently there are only around 13 million. We all know that we will get 8 million more bitcoins before the maximum is reached. So...Canada, Australia and China are having huge housing bubbles...what will happen when they pop? Will it be a domino affect? My goal is to have 21 million bitcoins. 212102100 But your claim was that value is taken from the existing coins.The current amount paid to miners is 3600 bitcoins or just over a million dollars per day if every miner cashed out all of their bitcoins. Personally, I see mining as a good way for people to "buy" bitcoins without the need to go through an exchange. You pay fiat for electricity and receive bitcoins. I know here in Europe there is a high demand for bitcoins such that people are willing to pay 20% over the bitcoin price to get their euros to bitcoins via localbitcoins.The inflation rate is fixed. It cannot go over 3600 bitcoins. So even if mining costs $10 trillion per day, the inflation rate cannot go over 3600 bitcoins per day. And with that knowledge, it is already built into the price. How many existing bitcoins are required to pay for bitcoin mining? Same thing that happens if a guy only has $200 in his bank account after the surgery.You get a bill. $10,000 by Friday.You saw it here folks. Buying and selling from your friends on Facebook would be one of the best ways to have trusted transactions. It makes it easier to pay via PayPal or bank transfer with a lower chance that the person will do a reverse on the payment. If they do, you can call them out on their wall in front of their friends and family. It might be better to come up with a sliding scale based on the amount being discussed.If I have $5 I don't say I have 500 cents. But if I have 50 cents I don't say I have .5 dollars.So when discussing something like .1 bitcoins you might say you have 100 mBTC and if you have .1 mBTC you have 100 bits. I have gained bitcoins this year. This. If mining costs more than bitcoins, miners actually take bitcoins out of the system to pay for their electric bills. So if bitcoin has a market cap of $1 billion and electricity costs are $500 million, miners will actually pull $500 million worth of money out of bitcoin.Amazing huh?And if the electricity costs are over $1 billion...the cost of bitcoins will go negative and anyone using bitcoin will actually be paying to use it. Or, more realistically, if miners are selling all of their coins there is a built in maximum inflation built into bitcoin which can easily be eaten up by the influx of new users. The amount of despair I have seen lately tells me that it is a great time to buy.I prefer hysteria...but a long period of despair is good too. Hmmm...I have a feeling that Bitlocker does not work on my cold storage device. Thanks dad! translation:NSA wants you to make it easier to associate a name with a node Yes Damn rich kids
I see this quote all the time, thanks dad but I can figure out how much I have to invest. When the price was $17 I took out $10k from my Roth IRA and bought bitcoins. Was that more than I could afford to lose? What does that even mean? Most people with a job can lose everything and because they still have a job they can keep going.So fuck it, here's my advice. Invest everything you can put together. The price is damn low and we're probably within 10-20% of the bottom (current price, $325). Drop your damn Roth...they'll find a way to tax it when you retire. Investing more than your company's matching into your 401k? Fuck that, dump it into Bitcoin. Any equity on your house? Refinance, put all of that money into bitcoins...the dollar will lose value in the next 30 years to the point where your $100-$300k mortgage will be pocket change. Do you have a job? If tomorrow your Bitcoin investment went to $0 would you still be able to live? Then dump it all into bitcoins...now. I am sure this thread will be riddled by people trying to "save you" from yourself. I'm here to help you. Am I just trying to pump up the price? No, the people reading this thread likely do not have enough money to change the price but a few dollars. Plus I sold the bitcoins I got from my Roth back when the price was $12, below what I paid for them (though I am still buying). I've just seen the warnings year after year since the price dropped to $2 and people were panic selling.Investing involves risk, higher risks tend to come with higher rewards. Donald Trump is worth billions but at one point was in debt over $900 million. Was $900 million more than he could afford to lose?Invest what you want, it's your life. Live it.Here is a nice wall of shame of a sampling of posts saving people from themselves when the price was in the single and double digits. Austrian school that is annoying because it is right all the time and the big brother with the power hates being reminded about it all the time.And thank you for making your view on Bitcoin clear instead of just trolling. My ignore list welcomes you. If I wanted to discuss the dollar I would go to bankrate.com. in b4  A good read:http://mises.org/daily/6945/When-Money-Dies-Germany-and-Paper-Money-After-1910 The high cost of education is directly related to the government subsidies the students receive. This buying of debt contributes to that high cost. The group is basically saying that I am an idiot for paying off my student loans.Boy is my face red.Not to worry...credit card debt here I come. Maybe they will buy that some day. Winklevii thisI am pulling all my transactions. P = 13.5t + 12t = months from November 2012so...2015 start: $3632015 end:  $525So the average: $444Though I fully expect that when the ETF opens up the price will jump...but I believe over the long term, barring an economic disaster, the price will gravitate toward the linear price whether above or below. Usually the ones that say this are Keynesians...They like the technology...but hate money with a limited supply.They want a blockchain technology where the exchange rate can be changed by a central authority. Pretty much...they want the fancy new technology but they want to be able to use it like the dollar. He is right about businesses not holding them on their books.There is just not any software that makes it easy for a business to hold bitcoins unless it is a small business where one person can control the money.We need multi sig software that allows a department to have funds which trickle down to an employee being able to pay for things that they currently pay for by writing a check or getting permission from their boss to pay for. It simply does not exist. Damned kids and their getting rich... The fact that the current law has been superseded by the concept of precedent has erased just about anything in the Constitution.  If someone were to put the pieces together that (for example) found that the third Amendment actually disallows eminent domain for building military bases, the fact that it has been done for hundreds of years would mean that a precedent has been set and that it is now legal. Even if it is un-Constitutional.And the fact that the law has been superseded by the concept of precedent comes down to the fact that the people with the power and the guns have deemed it so. No amount of pointing at the Constitution can change that.The Constitution was created to justify giving power to a new group of people...or more accurately, minimizing the resistance due to the thought that the new people in charge will be more fair in their use of that power than their predecessors.  I went to a Halloween party last night at Frankenstein's castle here in Germany. There was a show being given and the guy on stage was checking to see how many Germans there were and how many Americans by a show of hands. Because there were enough Americans there, he said he would do the show in English since the Germans should understand it.Though we should all start learning Chinese eventually. I would expect in 5 to 10 years for the dollar to crash hard which would throw all charts out the window. I'm a citizen of a country made up of 50 states...and it has an eagle as its national bird Though I do not live there...I still am required to bribe the politicians in order to freely exchange my services for money. Apply your skills you use to get paid in the every day world to get the ball rolling on a business where you will make bitcoins. Just about all of the work you can do over the Internet can also be done by a Chinese or Indian person over the Internet. Someone who can live off of a few hundred dollars a year. If you have something that needs to get funded, try BitPools...funding from the people to the solution. I sent it.Pay it forward.
There are many things. I would love to freely exchange my services in exchange for money. This is not allowed by my government.I would love to send my fiat money to a bitcoin exchange without the need to send proof of my identity and bank statements and phone verification. This is not allowed by my government.I would love to freely rent my house out to people in exchange for money. This is not allowed by my government.I would love to buy an item and pay the price that the shop owner is charging. This is not allowed by my government.And on and on...Sure, these things can be done as long as you bribe the politicians so that they can have more power to prevent people from freely doing these things. They are already being used to protect the politicians.You think the people enjoy being oppressed? What stands in the way of people taking back the country by force?Hint: standing army Would a rich person be able to pay them not to step out of it? $32 to $2 took a long time. We were down for almost 2 years from the $32 high.In the meantime...people started working on their bitcoin businesses. Anyone can claim anything. That's fiat in your bank account -> bitcoins.They need to wait for the money to be transferred from bank to bank. Coinbase So that's the end of Bitcoin thenhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/06/20/so-thats-the-end-of-bitcoin-then/ Bitcoin has died about 30 times...if the media had the ability to kill it, it would have died a long time ago. bueno Having your private key exposed on a network connected computer is vulnerable to anyone. Not just governments or ISPs. I would be more worried about a hacker if my private key is not behind encryption or in cold storage. Police are individuals with their own thoughts and ideals. At the linear formula's rate the price would be up about 50% in one year. Double in 2 years.Most conservative investments expect to double in around 20 years. And a linear formula would prevent this? That's not how Bitcoin works.You sign your transaction on your computer. Then you send the signed transaction over the network. Anyone can view that signed transaction and they would not have your private key. Are you saying that there should not be English posts in the Romanian section? Ya, I was being sarcastic considering China has the highest volume of all exchanges...China should ban some more to increase the volume even more.okcoin btcchina huobi lakebtc  Like Bitcoin. A currency with a slow gradual rise is not useful?What is your definition of a useful currency? You put up bitcoins as collateral. If the price falls below the margin you lose your bitcoins. Bitfinex has been around for several years. I have loaned bitcoins to people shorting, it is one of the few ways to make interest on your bitcoins with very little risk.
It is all the same."Leaders" taking power from people to build up their own power so that they have more power to take more power from the people. That is what it all boils down to...over and over throughout history.What excuses are your leaders giving to gain more power? I agree, what with all of the China exchanges going away and no more Bitcoin in China anymore. The proof is in the pudding. Great promotion! Besides this thread what else are you doing to promote the effort? Where can I buy some of your bitcoin2s?Will you trade BBQ coins for them? Ever been somewhere that the police came in and kidnapped someone in front of you?Did you step in to stop them?Why/Why not? It is the most secure. Talk of scenarios about how the Fed could pour money into hardware to generate a  51% attack on Bitcoin becomes less and less prevalent. But doing so to an alt would be a lot easier. I think this is key. Such a method or authoritative source would hold a lot of power over a decentralized system. They are given the power. So they use it. What is so hard to understand about this? For instance:http://www.coindesk.com/small-australian-city-plans-big-bitcoin-economy/Small Australian City plans big bitcoin economy.They plan on accepting Bitcoin as payment for taxes.I would think that this would require some sort of definition of what a Bitcoin is in case someone with some BBQ coins tries to claim that they paid with their digital currency.Most likely, the city is partnering with a payment processor that will convert into dollars for them but on a larger scale this could prove to be difficult from a legal perspective.  We all need to move toward multi-sig...great way for a lot of people to get their feet wet. The fact that they were willing to accept Bitcoin shows that they are on the cutting edge. They did a few other things technologically to advance their sales as well.Their revenue is up because they are willing to move their business forward. Bitcoin is part of that movement forward. Ron Paul inspired people to come out of the woodwork to donate on the hope that maybe he would have a chance of changing things from the way things are to actually making the government smaller.It was more of an investment than anything. Since his defeat they are going back to where they sprouted out for and will likely not come back to donate for a long time.For me, I think we are too far gone to be fixed. So I am planning accordingly. We need a standing army to protect the politicians from the people. Anything. Just as the high went far above the linear growth, the bottom could be far below. The price is right on target:P = 13.5t + 12t = 24 months (as of tomorrow)P = $336 Be that guy who figures out how to use bitcoin in your every day life. good question I am sorry to hear that your investment into a currency did not go as you planned.Perhaps next you can try pesos? I am starting to believe that your mom was a pump and dump.
BitPay serves a purpose.A business might not know much about Bitcoin and might not be willing to change how their whole system operates to adopt it. BitPay allows them to keep things running the same but take a few extra minutes and start accepting Bitcoin. They continue to do their finances the same way, get paid in fiat without any major disruption while saving a little bit of money on transaction fees in the process.If you were really concerned, instead of a boycott you would be coming up with simple solutions for businesses to integrate bitcoins into their finances such that accepting them without a middle man would make a lot of sense. Nothing you can do about government kidnappings. It is deemed acceptable. There is always someone suggesting..."consult your accountant, lawyer, etc.."If the laws are so complicated that you cannot figure it out yourself the law should be eliminated or revised. We should not have to rely on other people to live our own lives freely. the sky is falling   Does btc accept wire transfers for euros? Ya...it jumped up to $32 and crashed down under $2. No way it would go back up over $32. Was he buying a candy bar?To do a double spend you set up a transaction on the other side of the world and set up your transaction. When you do your current transaction you quickly process your transaction on the other side of the world.The transaction is grouped in among miners on both sides of the world, whichever miner gets that block will be the successful transaction. Once it sees that that transaction already occurred it will be dropped.After the first 10 minutes it is pretty much set. But it is just about mathematically impossible after 60 minutes. If you have an expertise or skill, try to figure out how to put that skill to use to make bitcoins. Same way businesses deal with the extremely long (6 to 18 months) wait for a credit card to be non reversible. With localbitcoins you are paying extra for someone to go through the effort of exchanging your money.Buy through an exchange and avoid the 5-6%. I am in favor of a slow gradual climb. This is a more attractive scenario for long term investors and anyone who wants to actually use Bitcoin as a currency.Quick jumps and crashes are not the characteristics of a stable currency that can be relied on for preserving value.Would I like it to jump to $10,000 each and stay at that level tomorrow? Yes. Will that happen if it is not a stable currency? No. Ok...sign a contract that gives me your house in exchange for 10,0000 bitcoins (as per your definition).Do not be surprised if you end up with 10,000 BBQcoins (which fits that legal definition). Each transaction now takes 180 days to clear. I think I will try this.If, in 1000 years, I cannot get my bitcoins...I am coming after you OP. Do you have any way to prove that you (a newbie with 9 posts) have the means to put 1000 ATMs in 1000 locations? I usually buy when there are stars in the sky (clouds or not).I sell when there are no stars. It takes at least 6 months for a non-refundable transaction. Congratulations on your bitcoin transaction. What fee did you pay for the transaction?                  Everyone could choose the amount they are paid in bitcoins via direct deposit if we had a Bitcoin Credit Union.
A kid can go to the store and buy things without their parents coming along.Bitcoins are just things you buy. Every International airport terminal in the world. If you follow the dotted line we are around $320 along that line right now. mBTC is a millibitcoinwho is using millibit? Yes, but the foreign country defines how it works in their own law, so it is legally defined somewhere.(Again, not looking to debate if a country would make BTC its own currency, purely an example) If the Isle of Man, or some other small country (Anguilla only has $18 million for their M1), wanted to officially recognize bitcoin as their national currency*, they would need to define it legally. You can't just have someone with BBQcoin coming in trying to pay their taxes with it. They would likely need a way to legally define it.Most likely they would have their central "Bitcoin Finance Agency" hold the "official" blockchain that they go by with the ability to make updates as needed. From there they can have rules in place for having the ability to fork with the right authority from multiple people's votes or authorization. The legal definition would include wording from the white paper and then references to the beginning block and any amendments for any forks.*(this is not a thread for debating whether or not a country should adopt Bitcoin as the national currency) I would be willing to start using bits. I hear far too often..."I don't have enough money to buy any bitcoins" 30,000 bitcoins were snatched right up in 30 minutes on bitstamp.1 million would lower the price but only temporarily as people pour their money in for cheap coins.  I worked with someone else on this, friendswithcoins.com but we both had other projects we were focused on.You would basically go on friendswithcoins and say that you were looking to buy or sell, then it would check your friends list to see if anyone else was buying or selling.If a friend was selling and you were buying you could send them a request for X amount of coins. If they accepted it then you would transact through the website.It is certainly a good idea, as we worked on it we saw some word about localbitcoins working on something for Facebook. It is all about expanding the userbase and having more uses for Bitcoin.Even if bitcoins are used to convert your dollars to buy lollipops and then convert back to dollars the bitcoin market has just expanded by that small amount and expands the need and thus grows the price. Save yourself a lot of hassle and sign up for a BitPay account. It takes about 5 minutes.As a small business you are not charged a fee (last I checked). The whitepaper could certainly be used as a starting point with a definition of the blockchain as referenced by the blockchain which started on X date with initial block Y.For any forks the legal framework could be set up to allow for an update saying "On W date, the official Bitcoin blockchain took the path of block Z".This would allow the blockchain to be legally defined, while the governing body would have the flexibility to adapt to changes. The price will go up over time, but more importantly...Bitcoin will grow over time. Praising white people for ending slavery is like praising white people for freeing the scribes from copying books (coincidentally around the time the printing press came about).Slavery in its previous form would have ended because of the technology that was able to overcome the need for it.But there is still slavery, just in a different form. People with power still use that power to control those without it. Learning about Bitcoin right now is like learning TCP/IP and HTML back in the 90s.You don't have to be knowledgeable so that you can become an IT guy or write webpages but in your area of expertise it would be good to know enough so that you can apply it to your talents and skills. Some guys with those basic skills created something called Google and Yahoo. Without that knowledge they would have probably bought a fried chicken franchise and learned about different spices and oils.Learn it so you can be involved in the future. Do you like your money being manipulated by a central authority?Do you like that your currency has a built in feature of losing at least 2% of its value each year?Do you like your bank and believe they sufficiently protect your identity and data? I haven't seen it like this since we went up to $600. The spring is coiled to the max. We will definitely be over $400 by this weekend. I was going to start a thread predicting that but want to get home and drop about $10k more before the price starts going up.I don't really have a sell point   I only pause my buying while I wait to see when to jump in. I will sponsor the purchase of one helium balloon with a string. You can print the paper wallet yourself.So....how much? .01 mBTC? Collateral. Most banks give loans with collateral. Don't pay your home loan? Your bank gets the house. Don't pay your car loan? The bank gets the car.They sometimes give smaller loans to customers with good credit with no collateral such as a personal loan but the worse your credit, the lower the amount.There are payday loans where you sign a contract to give them your paycheck if you do not pay. They cover everything very well in writing to make sure that if you default they get your check.The best loans currently for bitcoins are on the exchanges, they pay you interest daily and the site makes sure that the person has enough money to pay you back at all times. If it gets close to going below that amount, everything is paid back. Maybe if we pass a law against having WMDs then nobody will ever have any WMDs.Works for guns.
Business services are under supported and are typically the source of some big money. I hired a few guys from India to do some Bitcoin work. Grandma's about to get screwed out of her bitcoins.DO NOT SELL BITCOINS FOR PAYPAL! Every indicator I see right now says buy buy buy.In the short term at least. Anyone who calls it Bit coin knows nothing about Bitcoin. You can directly fund Hamas via Unicef's website here:http://www.unicef.org/iran/support_5860.html I stand corrected. Pee away ladies. Interesting, I've stayed in about 6 different hotels since August using this and this is the first time it happened. And they're all outside the US, Germany and Netherlands.Good to know they're still accepting it.  I just booked a hotel and when I got to the part of payment I saw no Bitcoin option. I have been using them for hotels for the past 2 months and always use that option but didn't see anything. $1600 in today's dollar value. Considering Bitcointalk is a central entity, they can be persuaded to turn over information. again I just noticed that all Bitcoin addresses that start with a 1 have been affected by Ebola. If yours starts with a 1, send your bitcoins to me and I will quarantine them for you. The theory was that since difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks, the halving would cause most miners to turn off their rigs...if that happened at the beginning of the 2 weeks then difficulty would be so difficult for the few remaining miners that they would never be able to mine the amount of coins necessary for the difficulty to ever adjust again. Of course, nothing close to this happened, difficulty went up and the price jumped. But Bitcoiners are so short sighted that the price only tends to go up after something has happened, not in anticipation of it. The ETF is not built into the price, the halving will not be built into the price. That didn't happen at the last halving...there was a lot of FUD from the miners about how Bitcoin would die because mining would stop and everything would crash. $10,000 when?tomorrow When the ETF happens the price will rise significantly. Unicef is a subset of the United Nations and should be avoided as much as possible. At least they lost the collateral that they put up for the loan right? I don't think Bitcoin will become infected by ebola.
Stopped reading there. Governments kidnap people all the time. But they call it "arresting". Male urinals are sexist. I have 1000 PPC but would not recommend buying any. I learned afterwards how unlike a commodity it is and wish I did not buy them. But I will keep them just because it was one of the first ones. They are built to lose value over time, not gain value. Transaction costs of .0001 bitcoins when there were 50 bitcoins per 10 minutes were worth $.0012 each.A transaction cost of .0001 bitcoins when there are 25 bitcoins per 10 minutes are worth $.0386 each.More expensive? Do not take risks. They only waste time when you could be sitting pretty on your government check. This is from 2012...before Overstock started accepting Bitcoin.I bumped because this approach worked to get a major company to accept Bitcoin. So...do we know of any other CEOs that supported Ron Paul?It looks like our e-mails worked for Overstock. Is Ripple that centralized thing owned by a company? Kinda like Western Union. When my wife had a clothing store I tried to set something like this up. I created QR codes on stickers that I put on the price tags of the clothes. Each QR code took you to a BitPay link with the price and a place to pay with BTC.After that experiment I realized that it would be too much hassle to set up a distinct sticker and QR code for each item and women's clothing was not the best place for early adoption of such a thing, especially in 2011 when hardly anyone had heard of Bitcoin. I move over $10k around all the time. If you do it enough and your account history shows it they don't bother you.The key is that you not withdraw a lot more than you put in. You have to pay taxes on your earnings so figure out your profit strategy to keep yourself out of the top bracket. Think about new socialist programs while having no idea about his web page. Funny how much neo cons agree with liberals when it comes to having weapons. Bitcoin has built its brand through millions of dollars worth of publicity and VC money.To change it now you might as well start a new alt using the current code.Want to start selling Coke under a new, more desirable name? I am sure it would sell just as well or even better. Welcome to Bitcoin! Like dollar squatters. People who buy dollars and hold them for a long time.The usual responses of...a whole country could run their economy on 1 bitcoin.And this: I am not asking what should we legally define Bitcoin as (money, commodity, etc).I am asking...what is Bitcoin? Legally speaking.The definition usually has to do with saying it is a decentralized p2p currency. Any definition of Bitcoin would need to include the Blockchain. But the Blockchain is constantly changing. The only way to define how it can change is through the code. But the code can change. It is open source and changeable. The only way to define how that can change is by defining who can change it and how. If I were to put in my will "I leave my son one bitcoin" how can that legally be executed? If I advertise my house for 1000 bitcoins, if someone gives me 1000 bitcoins from when it forked 2 years ago, how would that legally be settled? http://www.bitpools.comVote with your bitcoins. Welcome to Bitcoin!Initially 50 coins were mined every 10 minutes. Now only 25 are mined per 10 minutes.Did mining dry up? Did difficulty drop because nobody was willing to mine for such a small amount?No, difficulty has increased, the price has gone up a lot.Even now miners are paid more than 25 coins per 10 minutes.What about when it is down to 12.5 bitcoin per 10 minutes? Will people still mine? 6.25? 3.125? 1.5625? The computer my bitcoins are stored on has never touched the Internet. The only BTC I keep online are for spending and that would be like someone stealing my wallet from my pocket. It would suck but would not break me.
I am still waiting for my Xapo card...wish they would release them more quickly. The worst part is they were so very serious...so sad...I am appalled Those people, like me, who buy on Coinbase would have otherwise bought on the exchange...which would drive the price up.We need people to get paid in bitcoins to counter companies converting bitcoins to fiat. I borrowed last night from a guy named Vinnie in my neighborhood to buy bitcoins. I am sure this will work out. You need to go back 100% to fiat. Maybe a mutual fund or government bonds. This time they're real.And they will attack the US any day. We must defend ourselves! They would have to use fiat to fund it. Any war using bitcoins would be over quickly. Places to do business with bitcoin:New York In the short term I have seen that if the stock market crashes, so do gold prices. But over the long term if the stock market is down gold is up. For a small island I think these would be great for getting around: I use bitronictech.net, I am satisfied with their service. I pay in bitcoins. I think your uncle is Satan. Bitcoin has the exact same legal status in Russia as my balls.I can play with them but they are not considered legal tender. Bitcoins are not legal tender in Russia!?!?Oh nooo....Oh that's right...it is not legal tender in any country. collectivism...gotta love it Welcome to every government in the history of the world. Some people have no imagination. Thanks. Enjoy your statist paradise. The few places that I need to spend money already take it. I can use localbitcoins for the rest. You missed the part about me caring what other people do.
What I already use it for, to spend my money on things. That is fine for them. As long as I can still use bitcoins for what I want. I stopped caring what other people do long ago. I am moving forward, toward freedom. collectivism...gotta love it In the US the last rebellion did not succeed and the US government continued to get stronger. I doubt they will get overthrown nor would I be part of it. They will fall on their own without anyone's help. The ability to have a choice...wouldn't it be nice? Or just bypass them. Like creating an alternative currency and not using their system.Perhaps one that is decentralized and cannot be shut down. You can check out http://www.bitpools.com to see an example of how people can come together for major projects and vote with their money without being forced.A bunch of anarchists...using the Bitcoin blockchain to vote on how their money is spent...who woulda thunk it. I doubt you would listen.Smart roads, self charging roads, no need for fuel, more lanes, more competition...The government telephone monopoly was broken in 1984. You would have been on the side of people who felt that anarchy in the phone industry would leave us all without any phone service or as was argued at the time "you will need 5 phones in your house connected to 5 different companies".Someone saying "we could advance phone technology to have phones in your pocket calling unlimited long distance calls at one flat rate" would immediately be shot down as a crazy optimist with no clue about what would happen.Better to play it safe and stick with one long distance and one local phone system. It says more about you than me to believe that only teenagers like freedom. Explaining what good anarchy brings instead of talking about what bad government does is like asking to explain what good comes from someone not getting whipped without bringing up what is bad about being whipped.   If you don't think Starbucks will eventually be charging $1,000 for coffee you have not been to Starbucks lately. Anyone? It would be great if I could use that for my spending.

Last year when China banned Bitcoin we had an all time high price. Fueled by Chinese buying bitcoins. Happens every day for most people. Taxes, inflation, more regulations. People transfer money away from themselves daily without a thought.With Bitcoin it is about people holding onto power they used to so easily give away. happens all the time I tried to connect to the blockchain and it was shut down because of price. When will it be back up? At least wait until the price doubles once  Bitcoin Group (A Bitcoin mining company) is being listed on the Australian stock exchange.https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-groups-ipo-australian-stock-exchange/ Welcome to Bitcoin! You can't steal theft. If you had $100 last week you could have bought .3 bitcoins.Now you can only buy .25 bitcoins.Your money is losing value. A beginning is missing from this sentence.Who donates a miner to each family in poverty?And by "donate" do you mean at the point of a gun? I told my family about it but that is about it.The people who can use it and understand why it is good will find it. People who are sheep will be late to the game. Those that are against it will be on the streets begging for bitcoins down the road.I would rather people who actually understand it be the ones using it. They will help it to grow and reap the benefits. If you have to convince someone...let them be late to the game and find out later because eventually they will use it. You say oil corporation as if a corporation is not a government created entity...Venezuela's inflation is making the poor poorer. People are turning to the black market to get away from the poor economy there, Bitcoin will save many who can use it to bypass their currency controls. The rest will be lost to the power suck of their handlers.http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/08/us-venezuela-bitcoin-idUSKCN0HX11O20141008 Imagine if MtGox had a patent on the business method of Exchanging bitcoins for fiat. Poor people tend to be that way because of the power used by governments to take from them. Bitcoin is an aid for the poor against that power.What do you think is more likely from a centralized power?A) Work to distribute that powerB) Find ways to grow that power and make it more centralizedAny other thoughts of "good governments" are fantasies spun as a tool to further build that centralized power. Honestly I would put the value of 1 bitcoin at $317 right now. With a linear rise of about $13 per month. Dorian does not want bitcoins.He wants lunch. Yes, but they seized his coins. boy is my face red Watched it with my 74 year old mother. I liked it but thought it ended rather abruptly but I guess that had to do with them just trying to wrap it up and get it out the door.She knows a little bit about Bitcoin but she said that afterwards she still doesn't think she knows any more about it than before she watched it. She kept asking how the companies in the movie were making money and I think the coverage of Silk Road and the drug dealer made her uneasy, she said afterwards that the movie made bitcoin sound kinda scary (being older and being in that mindset of believing the banks and drug war and all that). When they determine how many gang killings were avoided because people could buy drugs online instead of involving gangs he will be given a medal for saving lives.
Bitcoin is dead. I tried to send some bitcoins today but the site was down. I called headquarters and they said they are closed for good. I am sure his victim will step forward very soon. I say his victim should decide the punishment. Welcome to Bitcoin! SecondMarket was working on something that would come out by the end of the year. Economics is not a science.It is a religion. Without people being paid in Bitcoin we will forever be in the mindset of "buying bitcoins". At some point we will need to transition from buying bitcoins to buying fiat for the few things Bitcoin does not provide.I am not, and would not think of, doing this alone as a business. I am in IT, just to apply yuo need someone with CPA or banking experience as the director and the members elect a board. I can help facilitate but cannot do it on my own, there would need to be community support of 500 to 3000 people showing an interest. The main focus would be on the ACH to access the Electronic Payments Network which allows a "depository institution" as defined in § 19(b) of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 461(b), this includes "insured credit unions".Federal credit union means a cooperative association organized in accordance with the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of promoting thrift among its members and creating a source of credit for provident or productive purposes;The term insured credit union means any credit union the member accounts of which are insured in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of the Federal Credit Union Act.For a credit union maintaining less than $50 million in deposits it is not too difficult to maintain insurance on users accounts. Especially since the Bitcoin credit union would never hold any fiat in accounts. It would immediately transfer any funds into bitcoins or to another bank account for deposit. The credit union is necessary to get a routing number to be used for direct deposit. I gave away .01 bitcoin for people to sign up on my website and verify their username on bitcointalk. I found that there are several people on bitcointalk who created accounts specifically to verify themselves to get free coins.Plus just about everyone who signed up never logged in again. The way MIT did it might work, focusing on a small community that would be smart enough to use Bitcoin and contribute to it. The creators of South Park are libertarians. They would likely support it. I agree, it would not make sense to use an exchange. Working either with a bitcoin debit card company or directly with high volume miners would allow for getting exchange rates without the overhead of the exchange.Considering the amount and time would be fairly consistent it would be easier to negotiate ("Our current fiat amount is $385,000 every Friday increasing at an average rate of 5% per month.."). Might even be able to negotiate a rate better than exchanges to cover the minimal costs of operation.Working with debit card companies will make it much easier...most of a credit union's costs come from offering fiat services. Holding zero balances would cut out most of the cost. Nice, I am still working on US to Germany for myself via bank accounts but have started with localbitcoins for now. Your brother could possibly get an extra 10% or so if he uses localbitcoins and there is demand near him.The thing is, I see potential once I get it automated because I work with a lot of people in the same boat as me complaining about the bite the banks take on getting their dollars to euros. Hundreds of people making six figure incomes. People will be willing to check out this Bitcoin thing if I show them they can save money each paycheck using it. As someone in the US who just went through the housing bubble 5 years ago here is what happened.The interest rate was so low that when calculating how much you can afford for a house per month you were more willing to pay more for a house because the monthly bill would not be as much. Also all of the housing prices were rising so you figured that if you paid a little bit more you could get your dream house and sell it down the road for double making a buttload, more than you could working. All of the prices were going way up, people were buying several homes figuring that if they could have a few houses they could rent them out and get the income while also being able to sell at a huge profit. As they bought one home and the value went up they would finance from the equity in that home as the price went up...this created more demand and higher prices. The prices went up the most in cities where new construction was not possible, in cities that could expand the rate did not climb as much because new home companies were popping up houses to try to meet demand.Then the bubble popped. Triggered by the AIG, bank crash.The people that were in the process of acquiring new properties were usually stretched very thin money wise because they were putting everything they had into the next house. That next house would not sell/rent so they would be stuck on a property that was losing them money. They would try to dump that house but nobody would buy. Housing prices started dropping quickly. People who were renting started seeing these cheap houses that they could not afford previously and started breaking their leases and bought cheaper houses. People who were into real estate would have a bunch of empty homes with no income, they would end up being mortgaged up to their eyeballs and needed to drop their homes so they would sell on a short sale. There were an increasing amount of foreclosures on the market making people who were buying homes look for extremely cheap deals (I was talking to a guy in my town that bought a nice house on the Gulf or Mexico for $60,000). For me personally, I bought a house in San Antonio as the bubble was building for $130k but the prices weren't as high in San Antonio because there was room to expand housing and new homes were going up all over. Then the bubble hit, I moved to Florida because of my job and rented a house there. I tried to sell my house but could not find a buyer so I put it up for rent and was fortunate to get a renter to cover the mortgage. After a few months in Florida seeing the housing prices dropping I found a great house on the Gulf for $290k, it had been appraised for $600k two years before. So we broke our lease (had to pay a few thousand to get out of the lease) and bought the house. I was finally able to sell my house in San Antonio for $118k, fortunate to be down only $12k compared to other people. The guy that sold me the Florida house had houses all over the place, he went bankrupt and ended up getting a divorce and moving in with his grandmother. He had a million dollar home with several other nice homes as well, none of them sold, one the bank just tore down and turned into an empty lot, another still sits there an empty shell because he could not finish the interior. He had a really nice yacht, everything...it all came tumbling down. Shortly after I bought for $290k the zillow price eventually wound down to about $170 at its lowest point. Not it is back up to around $230k. I will likely sell in a few years, hopefully close to what I paid for it. Although I would love for it to be higher, I predict the price on January 1, 2015 will be $350. What is the maximum amount of dogcoins there will ever be? Don't they spit out like 10 billion dog coins per hour? Simpsons did it. Or just buy a power plant.

Earth is #1!!!Earth! Earth! Earth!Woohoo!!!Everyone living on Earth is the best, everyone else is bad! Go Earth!If you're not with us, you're against us!Green and blue...these colors don't run. Crony capitalism? Capitalism between friends? Using this site you can model some of thing aspects of the market that you believe will take place and get a price from there.http://worldbitcoinnetwork.com/BitcoinPriceModel-Alpha.htmlBased on the model, what price do you think we will be at in one year? You use that term freedom...I do not think you understand what it is. I'm not really bitching...just pointing out that all of the problems people complain about tend to revolve around the fiat world of bitcoin. Which is not really a bitcoin problem. Would the 50+ people who answered that they would want to be paid all or a percentage in bitcoins be willing to do so by signing up for a credit union that would direct deposit into their bitcoin address? I would imagine for the $50k upfront costs we could get some sponsors to help with that. Maybe sponsor the first 500 people's membership fees. Because of The Manipulator   People realized that it is "PayPal's finance company made it so PayPal merchants can sign up for BitPay and accept bitcoins via their API."This is a bit further from being able to send your friend bitcoins via PayPal.We are in a wait and see mode at this point. TA on this chart shows that we will be at $300 for infinity. The original ETF was submitted in July of 2013...an ETF usually takes roughly one year to be approved.The ETF was re-submitted in February 2014. If it still takes around a year it might not take place until early 2015. More bitcoins are being spent now than they were. Early adopters are not as much of a factor now. Most major funds cannot purchase bitcoins until they are on a stock exchange.Hence...the ETF.Some people who work on Wall Street have been buying through SecondMarket.But when the funds start buying...that will be the kicker. That would be nice but the linear growth rate from the time of the halving is about $13.50 per month. Though I would certainly be ok with your scenario.If we follow the growth of past exponential runs we tend to do a doubling that starts to cut in half the time starting at one month.So we would have:Oct 4: $275Nov 4: $550Nov 18: $1100Nov 25: $2200Nov 29: $4400Very close to your scenario by Nov. 29  fiatThe price in fiat is too volatile.It is too hard/expensive to exchange fiat for bitcoins.It is too hard/expensive to exchange bitcoins for fiat.Governments regulating the process of going back and forth from fiat to bitcoin.Merchants driving down the price by immediately converting their bitcoins to fiat.Fraud on the fiat/bitcoin exchanges.Miners are cashing out their bitcoins for fiat to pay for electricity.Can you think of any solutions to this problem? It is a real e-mail from a real scammer. The price has seen the bottom. We are in for a long uptrend. It is likely rising faster than it should so do not be surprised if it goes back to around $320. But we are also in a prime place for some good news to spark a huge rally like it did last year, however unfounded the news might be. I remember seeing on bitcoinity the "last transaction" list on the right side with some huge transactions. Downloading the full blockchain just to buy one souvenir coin and then hope that it lasts for more than a few months is quite the leap.After Bitcoin is peace on earth. If you live in the US, Coinbase is super easy.My 74 year old mother was able to buy bitcoins through them using her phone.
A fair observation. The key is that if the small percentage of society that is actually capable of taking care of themselves are left free to improve their own lives they tend to improve more than just their own lives in the process. If, instead of working on inventing the lightbulb, Edison was obligated to spend half of his week feeding the homeless or doing some other charity work it would have been time wasted and the lightbulb would have taken much longer to get invented, if ever. But it improved everyone's life, not just his own. Did he make money off of it? Yes, that was part of his motivation to not just go live in the mountains and fish all day when things became difficult.There are a lot of scammers out there in the Bitcoin world. The less intelligent will get taken advantage of. It is a clear case of smart, taking from less smart. But other smart people will be able to build systems to not only protect their own bitcoins but those of other people. They will certainly be motivated by profit for part of it as well as seeing a problem that requires a solution.It has been said that if you were to take all of the money in the world right now and distribute it equally to everyone, it is very likely that over the years the balance of money would eventually end up again where it is today. Great idea, the best way to fund this type of venture would be via BitPools. http://www.bitpools.comPeople pooling their bitcoins toward a common goal. No need to call the bottom anymore. IPv6 is a vast improvement over IPv4.That came out in the 90s.What is your IPv6 address? TCP/IP has competitors too...When is the last time you used ATM? Funny how people are acting like this is something new.Have you read the white paper? this I live and work in Germany, I get paid in dollars.I convert my dollars to bitcoins. I sell my bitcoins on localbitcoins for euros.I do not have to the high conversion fees. I do not have to pay the high wire transfer rates.Because I sell on localbitcoins I actually make about 10% on the conversion.No problem here. Buy dollars, stick them under your mattress. Bank can't freeze my bitcoins.Only 3 of your cons did not involve fiat currency. The main problems with Bitcoin are trying to live on two currencies. I live on the dollar and the euro and it makes things difficult. It would be so much better if everyone just used bitcoins. China banned Bitcoin and yet they have the highest volume of trades.If Russia bans Bitcoin the trade volume will be through the roof.

"Stephen Cotton attempted to withdraw £7,000, a little over $11,500, from his HSBC account in the United Kingdom. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 program Money Box, he recounted how staff at the branch refused to allow him to withdraw the money without an explanation of why he needed it, in addition to proof. In this case, Mr. Cotton intended to repay a loan from his mother. The bank demanded he produce a letter from her, verifying this. Cotton then found himself in the position of haggling with staff over how much he could actually withdraw; finally, he was allowed to take out £3,000."Read more at http://guardianlv.com/2014/01/money-in-the-bank-no-longer-belongs-to-you/#EPv8dG31Qaff16M9.99 Less people?

Rewarding individuals with lower fines compared to companies means mining will be more distributed in Russia.  Should the rich who continue to voluntarily work for money be shot or just kidnapped and caged? I can see it taking over in more and more places. I have already reached points where I have used Bitcoin and wonder what other method I might have used if it was not so easy to use Bitcoin.I get paid in dollars but live in Germany so converting my paycheck to bitcoins is necessary. I still have a mortgage so I use some dollars towards paying that down but my house is rented and the rent almost covers the mortgage. For income tax purposes I have been putting more dollars towards the mortgage (about $4k per month) instead of cashing out bitcoins for a profit to pay it off. With the price this low I dropped my payment to $2k this month so I can put more toward bitcoins.My apartment here in Germany is actually rented via airbnb which they said is working on accepting bitcoins. That would be perfect. Welcome to the world. Have you seen the news yet?
Why or why not? $275 freedom from the initiation of forcesocialism rewards initiating force There was as many articles about this weekend's crash as there were about the Silk Road crash 1 year ago.Prices never recovered after all of that negative attention. On your computer that is not connected to the Internet load vanitygen.Run it to get public and private addresses.Save, encrypt the private keys.Send bitcoins to the public addresses. Socialism is very rewarding if you are in on the ground floor and have control of the power used to keep the people in line. Then you become a master of people and can get all sorts of perks that you will not allow your followers to have. Being a currency is nothing to sneeze at. The article says that Overstock will be working with the SEC...so it is very likely that the process will still be similar, just with improved technology. The price should be in the $300-$350 range for the next few months. It will rise on its own...no need to push it up to da moon only to have it come back down again to where we are. Focus on your Bitcoin business, buy if it goes lower than $300 and buy things when it is over $350. I would personally do 100% bitcoin.I get paid in dollars in the US and live in Germany where I use euros. It is much easier converting bitcoins to euros than dollars. Credit Unions are member owned, most will charge a membership fee up front of around $25. If we are able to get 500 people who are interested, an up front fee of $100 each would cover the start up costs...the recommended initial users of 3000 would only require a $20 up front fee.The price given for yearly expenses by the NCUA is around $75,000. Without handling cash or loans this price would likely be lower. Say around $50,000 for simplicity sake.So we could either get 500 new people per year at $100 each or 2500 people per year at $20 each. Or we charge a small percentage for exchanging from dollars to bitcoins.With 500 people making the average US salary of around $50,000 per year we could charge .2% per direct deposit to cover costs. With 1000 people we could get the rate down to .1%...quite negligible.And being member owned, the members get to decide the best route.And if it had enough support I am sure a few early adopters would be willing to put up the initial $50k to get this set up. Don't use new technology...cuz the environment Ya, this is beyond just spam or phishing. This is extortion. Governments do not tolerate competition in this realm. For transferring, an offline computer with a CD burner is good enough.For long term storage, engraved metal is the best bet. Dude is only 4 months old give him a break.Been saving since June...it's his life savings. The last hope for what? Bitcoin works. More investors are just people on the sidelines. If China bans Bitcoin any more they'll have all of the bitcoins. I live in Germany but get paid in the US so I use a US bank account for my CoinBase account. The $100k was off the top of my head after reading the NCUA site. Here is their break down of a typical credit union:Estimated Pre-Chartering (Start-Up) CostsPre-Chartering Consultant/Organizer Fees: 35,000Electronic Data Processing Computer Hardware: 2,800General Ledger/Share and Loan Accounting Software: 4,000Computer Installation & Training: 1,485Check Writing Software (Laser): 500Loan Delinquency Notice Printing Software: 220Statement Printing Software: 275Direct Deposit - ACH Software: 1,670Enhanced General Ledger Software (Fixed Assets,Prepaid/Deferred Expenses, Accrued Expenses): 250Credit Bureau Software: 795Credit Bureau Reporting Software: 330Total Estimated EDP Computer Costs: 9,905Furniture & Equipment - Desks, Chairs, File Cabinets,Security: 4,000Marketing/Surveying: 1,000Total Estimated Pre-Chartering Costs: 49,905Another chart shows - Total Estimated Annual Operating Expenses: 76,781These are taken from the NCUA website:http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Documents/CUDev/AcrobatDocument6-26-09.pdfWe would actually have lower expenses as we would be focused mainly on Direct Deposit - ACH with no need for loans or holding account balances, etc. So the government can tax their gains. 
I use blockchain.info to get the balance for Bitcoin addresses for my site. I never knew they required some sort of credit. I have problem doing so, just never saw anything like that. People are always complaining that those lucky early adopters shouldn't be so rich, they don't think it's fair that they have so many bitcoins.So now that you are buying bitcoins at such a low price, are you worried about the ridicule you will get when you buy your penthouse apartment with bitcoins and fund your next business venture completely with the bitcoins you are buying right now?Do you feel guilty? I have loaned people bitcoins myself to be shorted. It is one of the few ways to get interest on your bitcoins.And there are a whole lot of people with bitcoins on websites. I have 11 still on BitFinex just because. Quite arrogant of them to believe that some New York regulation is the reason for the drop. A 30k bitcoin wall would say differently. Short selling has been available for years. It is available on many sites, BitFinex is the most popular at the moment.You borrow people's bitcoins and you short them. I saw this. It says you can buy bitcoins from any bank. Can I get euro for bitcoins? And is this from any bank or any bank using Sofort?I cannot access 247Exchange.com at work so I will definitely check it out when I get home. Sold...over the span of several hours.I think the dude lost his Internet connection when he tried to put up a fake wall. Couldn't afford wifi. Why is there this "need"?There has been an invention, they call it the aeroplane. It is faster than a bullet train. Ich habe bemerkt, in dem Bild, das ein Geldautomat wurde nach Frankfurt kommen. Ist das noch passieren? Gibt es eine Stelle? I find it odd that the results of this poll and the poll asking about a Bitcoin Credit Union are so vastly different when they are both basically the same.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=810747.0If your company is not willing to pay you in bitcoins (you can probably count on your hand how many will), a Credit Union direct deposit is the easiest way to achieve that. So I should drop this whole Bitcoin thing and go with Western Union because there are scammers, there are other options and you don't trust CoinBase. Which alt coin can I do an online money transfer to? How many ripples can I sell on localbitcoins for euros? SOLD It all comes down to power. Votes, positions, speeches, hair, does not matter. Whoever has the power gets to control how things are.Wars, police states, etc...all come from that power.The same people who are against those things tend to also want to feed the power with promises of free stuff. If you are willing to hand your own power over to someone else, or encourage the use of that power to take from someone else in exchange for promises, you are part of what leads to wars and oppression. They would be able to if there was competition. It is not their fault that the government monopolizes public services and infrastructure.  People should go through their lives with the thought that if they can't take care of themselves someone else will be there to take care of them.That should lead to some sound decision making.To think that everyone else is selfish and that you need to take care of yourself will just lead to some sort of crazy self reliance that would be terrible for poor people.Stay in school? Nah, there are unselfish people out there that will help me...school is too hard anyway.Choose a major in English (which almost everyone speaks) instead of Engineering? If I don't find a job some unselfish person will get me through life...Engineering requires that hard math anyway.Go get drunk with my friends instead of studying for that exam? My friends aren't selfish, they'll take care of me the rest of my life..the exam isn't important.Get off my ass and look for a job? Nah, it's much easier to stay at home playing video games, some unselfish person out there will pay for my rent. You are correct, most companies that work for/with the Federal government have their fiscal years start Oct. 1. I work for government contracting companies and that has always been my fiscal year. Being overseas you probably have more exposure to these types of companies than those not connected to the government. As someone who has started working in a foreign country getting paid in dollars...I have seen first hand how Bitcoin is a huge advantage over wire transfer and currency conversion.For example, my mother came out to visit me here in germany. She exchanged $1000 to 715 euros before she came out through her bank. That is not including what it would have cost to wire it over here if she was not flying.I sold roughly 3 bitcoins for 900 euros through localbitcoins, then I bought that same amount of bitcoins on CoinBase for $1024. The straight conversion should have been $1000 for 750 euros (at the time). I charge a 10% margin but could lower it if I needed to.Why would I use anything other than Bitcoin? Sell me on using Western Union. People getting paid in Bitcoin would counter the companies converting bitcoins to fiat. There's less than 30k bitcoins to $3000 on stamp. Not much money on the exchanges to buy much more.They need a recharge.
A few million dollars a month needed for mining.Banking industry spends billions per month just for keeping the lights on.The remittance industry charges tens of billions per year just in fees.As someone who has started working in a foreign country getting paid in dollars...I have seen first hand how Bitcoin is a huge advantage over wire transfer and currency conversion.For example, my mother came out to visit me here in germany. She exchanged $1000 to 715 euros before she came out through her bank. That is not including what it would have cost to wire it over here if she was not flying.I sold roughly 3 bitcoins for 900 euros through localbitcoins, then I bought that same amount of bitcoins on CoinBase for $1024. The conversion should have been $1000 for 750 euros (at the time).Why would I use anything other than Bitcoin? Sell me on using Western Union. Most likely CoinBase keeps X amount of dollars on BitStamp and Y amount of bitcoins. They can reload as one or the other starts to go down which allows for the instant purchase when someone buys on their site.But, there were so many people buying against that $300 wall that their X amount of dollars dried up...so now they need to wire more dollars to BitStamp before they can start buying again. So that is the answer to the question of "what if <insert X early adopter/FBI> dumps all of his bitcoin on the market at once?"it gets gobbled up lol And the wall...came tumbling down... I'd buy up a bunch via CoinBase but I imagine by the time it goes through we will be much higher than the current price. Ya, probably some dude was going to put up a fake wall and then drop it so the price would shoot up but then lost his Internet connection. 8500 I was wondering when this would happen.They need to get more money over to bitstamp. 13,500 If the pay was the same, would you rather get paid in bitcoins, fiat or a fixed percentage of both?Also, would you be willing to sign up for a credit union that converted your bitcoins automatically by just giving your employer a direct deposit number? Welcome to Bitcoin. I had my finger on the trigger on CoinBase to buy 20 at $290...was waiting it to fall to the low 280s... The last time "the Manipulator" was around it was found to be the owners of Bitcoinica changing the price to short squeeze people.Be careful if you have bitcoins on an exchange.Bitcoinica eventually got "hacked" and a lot of people lost money.MtGox was also manipulating the price too. If it were not PoW it would be "Bitcoin currently spends $500 million per year on <insert other security mechanism here>"If it did not cost a lot, anyone could pay cheap prices to either destroy Bitcoin or get all of the bitcoins. They did...it is called the Willy bot. Darn, had a buy of 20 btc waiting to go down a little lower than $290 Good bye low prices. Just broke through $300 and rising quickly. Someone who commits fraud.fraud: deceit, trickery, sharp practice, or breach of confidence, perpetrated for profit or to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage Not necessarily a split between BTC and fiat because that would require the Credit Union to hold fiat deposits which would just turn it into yet another bank account and make it more difficult to get approved and more costly to run.Some employers allow you to withdraw different percentages to different bank accounts. But if we got the exchange price as close to 0% as possible (contracting with companies that need fiat for bitcoins) then it would be just like being paid in bitcoins. Then you could convert what you need in fiat via CoinBase or use a bitcoin debit card or the many other ways of getting fiat for bitcoins.You can set up Coinbase to do an automatic buy, it would have to be timed the day you get paid and if your pay goes up or down it would not be able to fluctuate. Plus it takes several days for the transfer to go through. And you need a bank account for this, which would be more likely to freeze your account with no legal recourse as opposed to the government shutting down a whole credit union without any legal recourse.With direct deposits people actually are given the option of never having a bank account ever again. I have no bank account in germany, if I need cash I sell on localbitcoins (bought a car that way last month). But I still need my US account for funding CoinBase.
I have seen one of those fake bitcoins. Don't trust bitcoins you receive from an address that starts with a 0. That is how you can tell it is counterfeit. $20 may have been reasonable before the halving but it is clear that the half was not factored in just like we are not buying now based upon the 2016 halving.We should be in the $300 range. There is no other reason to push the price down so low unless you are buying a lot of cheap coins...which at that point the buyer will want the price to go way up.Reminds me of the days of The Manipulator (TM) For a nationwide credit union a physical location makes no sense at all.If there is another way that I can go to my employer right now and give them my direct deposit account number and get paid in bitcoins, I am all ears.A simple credit union can be started for less than $100k. Focusing first solely on direct deposit would bring the price much lower.The BitPay payroll is trying to get companies to sign up to pay their employees in Bitcoin. But matching companies that pay in Bitcoin and people who want to be paid in Bitcoin will be a small number.The price may be as low as it is because so many people are clinging on to the fiat world so much that the concept of getting paid in Bitcoin and converting to fiat for those few things they need to pay for is a scary concept.I, for one, get paid in dollars and live on euros in Germany. I wish I could drop my US bank account but I need it for direct deposit to convert to bitcoins. Ok, so after the fake MtGox manipulated run up last October we are back to where the price should be. $312 I just dropped $2k on some more bitcoins.I will be considered greedy and a 1%er down the road and people will say it's not fair. Did you read the investment advice given in the white paper? Price should be around $315 That is exactly what this is for, getting away from brick and mortar institutions. Right now you need a bank account to get paid in fiat so you can send that fiat to an exchange.What we need to move forward is for people to get paid in Bitcoin.We have merchants accepting Bitcoin but they are paid in bitcoins and immediately convert it to fiat.We need people who get paid in fiat to immediately convert to bitcoins. The other side of the chicken and egg. No, it would serve only one purpose. Direct deposit to your Bitcoin address. There is no need for any physical location other than what is required for a main office address. I agree, but there are no options such as coinbase, bitpay, bitstamp, etc to do so.Even if an employer wanted to do so they would have to jump through plenty of hoops to make it work.  Ahh, I see. That would make things difficult. I was focusing on the US, I guess I should have clarified that. I have a credit union account with an account number and checks and everything a bank has. I can do ACH transfers, etc. A credit union is member owned, is usually for a specific purpose and not as complicated as a bank.In the US when you go to get paid they ask for your direct deposit routing number and account number. The routing number is the number for the financial institution and the account number references your account. If we can get a routing number we can set up the account numbers to point to a specific Bitcoin address.I think if we could do like BitPay does where companies that want to accept Bitcoin with no desire to deal in Bitcoin can do so, but we can set it up so that people who are paid in fiat with no desire to deal in fiat can do so. A hybrid approach to people being paid in Bitcoin just like BitPay is a hybrid approach to merchants accepting Bitcoin. It would also be the best way to associate a Direct Deposit account number to a Bitcoin address.Any business or individual can give out that number for direct deposit to their Bitcoin address. While this can be done via coinbase by setting up some sort of automation, with a credit union people can skip the step of money flowing through their bank account and the problems that come with having a bank account.This would be like BitPay but in reverse. The employee doesn't have to worry about fiat and gets bitcoins directly in their account. Sorry, changed to a poll, will reply there. I would like to get a feel for how much interest there would be in forming a Bitcoin Credit Union. Post your thoughts here.ObjectiveSet up a Credit Union where Bitcoin users can set up direct deposit at work directly to a Bitcoin address. This will be the main function of the Credit Union initially with the ability to expand into other services down the road.ApproachCredit Unions are not as difficult to get running as one might think. The main initial steps are setting up a business plan and getting signatures from those that might be willing to join. The goal will be to get 3,000 people to support the concept while less is still ok but makes things more difficult. 500 people will be the minimum. Focusing on a simple initial setup of direct deposit will allow us to apply for an Express Charter and will make it more likely that the Credit Union will be approved.What we need to beginThere are 10 main steps to setting up a Credit Union:1. Find something in common (Bitcoin users)2. Get together. A "yes" vote by 500 members while 3000 will help the process.3. Do the paperwork. There will be plenty of forms to be filled out and submitted.4. Meet the membership requirement. We will need to get signatures and a survey from the potential members.5. Find a financial expert. We need a CPA or someone good with accounting for the organizing committee.6. Form a committee. A small amount of people to help organize with good financial history.7. Set up a board of directors. We will vote on who we want for the initial board of directors.8. Collect money. To help with the initial funding we will need funds to get the ball rolling whether through donations or initial membership fee.9. Charter assistance. It would be useful to have the assistance of someone who has already set up a Credit Union to help review our submission.10. Apply for status. Petition the National Credit Union Administration for official status.Initial business planThe goal is to make direct deposit to a Bitcoin address as simple as possible. A Bitcoin user will join the Bitcoin Credit Union with the same process as joining a bank or credit union. They will provide a deposit Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin Credit Union will provide an account address. The Bitcoin user will provide the direct deposit account to their employer and when they are paid the funds will be converted to bitcoins and deposited into their account. From the user this process will be transparent. The Bitcoin Credit Union will coordinate with a company/companies to provide the best exchange rate. The members will decide whether day to day operations are paid for via the initial membership fee or from a small percentage taken during the conversion. The goal will be to keep the cost down as low as possible using volunteers as much as possible for operations.If you made it this far and are interested, sign up here to help move this forward.http://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20Credit%20Union delete I almost sold at $2 because everyone was talking about how it would probably go below a dollar. Please sell.Pay day is here.
When I ran my own business I gave a 5% discount for cash payments. If what you are buying is on Amazon it's 33% cheaper.Average Joe can stick with his fiat. We have what we need now, price does not matter. Quit worrying about average Joe.   With the price this low I am seeing the same sentiment I saw back in November 2011 when the price was at its lowest...figured I'd bring back a taste of what was going on at that time. More sunburns. That would be reflected in the amount of bitcoins going through the exchange. No it was not. He stole Windows from Xerox/SRI. Bitcoin user not affected That showed the amount of bitcoins on the exchanges vs the amount in circulation. It is only those bitcoins that actually affect the price while the rest are absorbed into the economy.The difference could be different now as I do not have numbers on all of the exchanges but it should be similar. This only gives the rest of the world more power in the future over Russia. That has already been absorbed by so many investors (Winklevii, Branson, Second Market, Chinese, etc...)Many more investors will absorb it just the same. Updating the numbers:(3600 blocks per day * $380) / 6 = $228,000 Bad news, if a country has a war on Bitcoin it will probably eliminate it as well as the war on drugs has. Or figure out what your Bitcoin business will be, or how to integrate Bitcoin into your current skills or talents. Maybe Satoshi Nakamoto took on the name of Steve Jobs early on for anonymity...only revealing his true name when he could create something worthy of his name. Ahh, this is the first I have read of someone wanting to use the blockchain for tie breaking. A few methods for voting but not tie breaking.Perhaps you could come up with the standard  Maybe just take the next block ID and use the last number, if higher or lower than X the tie goes to one or the other. Same can be done for 3 and 4 way ties breaking up the numbers to 3 and 4 divisions. MIT report finds bitcoin more likely to be spent than hoardedhttp://www.coindesk.com/mit-report-bitcoin-more-likely-spent-hoarded/ This was back in January.Notice the post that said something about the coins all moving to gox...
It's not people. Just monsterer. The same people who will attack Bitcoin because they are environmentalists are the same people that will attack Bitcoin because they are Keynesians.Solution. Let them both cling on to their hokey religions and we move forward to a better future. No need to destroy Bitcoin to appease stupid people. Let them use Doge. On Bitcoinica.After seeing this happen a few times I pulled out the remaining 400 or so bitcoins leaving "only" about 40 bitcoins on the site.The next week it was "hacked".It was later found that blatant manipulation was happening so that trades such as mine were short squeezed. So people should be spending, as this chart indicates is happening? I remember shorting at $4 waiting to close the short at $3.50.It reached $3.60 then shot up to $4.50....short squeeze. That was with several hundred bitcoins. After reading this, would you have sold and waited for the price to drop below $1 back in November 2011? With the value of the euro going down I think you could buy a cup of coffee with that. Funny coin Doge is.Many coins per minute it makes. I am still waiting for the inevitable environmental backlash from the 390 million tonnes of CO2 produced by the banking system. I keep wanting to click ignore but we are getting a small window into the soul of a madman. Yes, as a seller. Sellers go to Amazon and choose the item/items they want. They create a wishlist then post the link on purse.io along with how many bitcoins they are willing to pay for those items.The amount goes up on the buy list and when someone makes the purchase they send you a message. Purse.io holds your bitcoins in escrow.Once the item arrives, you release the bitcoins to the buyer.I have used it a few times to get some good discounts on Amazon items. Yep, next time I see the U.S. Military I will tell them. "When one considers Koomeys Law, we can expect energy/GH to continue to half every 18 months until 2048.This means that we can expect our current industry best efficiency of 0.733 W/GH to reach 0.0000000873804 W/GH." Not to mention the environmental impact of the wars that take place because of and with the help of fiat systems. A long series of research of each currency, a pretty good detailed read:http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-economic-environmental-costs-bitcoin-mining/http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-true-costs-gold-production/http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-real-costs-dollar/http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-conclusions-costs-bitcoin/ Welcome to the thread. Perhaps you missed this: You can read the full article where the chart comes from here:http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-conclusions-costs-bitcoin/"As can be conclusively seen, the relative impact of the bitcoin network does not even register on the radar of the fiat and gold-based monetary systems, representing a very conservative relative environmental impact of just over 0.13%, and a relative economic impact of just under 0.04%. When one considers Koomeys Law, we can expect energy/GH to continue to half every 18 months until 2048.This means that we can expect our current industry best efficiency of 0.733 W/GH to reach 0.0000000873804 W/GH. Thus  armchair academics take note  in the event that bitcoin scales to a million times its current size and market cap over the next 30 years, its environmental impact will still be insignificant compared to existing systems." Proof of Work uses as much electricity to mine 1 bitcoin as it does 1,000,000 bitcoins. It has nothing to do with per user. Bitcoin uses proof of work.Any crypto currency using another algorithm would be an alternative to Bitcoin.You mean the public outcry that occurs from the environmental impact of banks and fiat?again Perhaps you missed it:
Good luck with your alt.  When Bitcoin becomes mainstream, the environmentalists will need to worry more about finding their next meal than how Bitcoin is for the environment.Considering they will be the last few that still believe in fiat as they tend to believe whatever their centralized controllers want them to believe. So funny is the dog coin. Not sure, one of the articles explaining it explained it in that way. I prefer All Your Base coins. Much more classy meme based coin. I believe you will be able to go to BitPay and sign up for an account then link it to your PayPal merchant account. Being a liberal means never needing to say you're sorry. I talked to the U.S. Military yesterday and they said they don't care. Welcome to Bitcoin.That article is from January 22 (2 weeks after Overstock started accepting bitcoins). Thank him for the cheap coins? http://www.purse.ioYou go on there and find the amount you want to buy at what rate. When you click on the link you will then make an Amazon purchase for goods of the seller.Once the purchase has been delivered you get the bitcoins. It is fairly active. You can get interest on your bitcoins on BitFinex. The rate is usually not that great (around 2% yearly), the rate goes up and down with the demand for shorts.I have gained a few bitcoins from doing this but during some volatile times.Your bitcoins are fairly secure since BitFinex has been around a few years and they are making money without any scams. But you have to weigh the risk that you do not hold your own bitcoins in exchange for a very small interest rate. For most it is not worth it. BitFinex could close the doors tomorrow and you'd be screwed. I trust Coinbase. They have been around long enough and have a lot of capital behind them. I keep some bitcoins on there just because I haven't gotten around to moving them to a secure address.It is also the only company I have been able to buy bitcoins from which is sad that there is only one US company I can use. I am glad Circle opened up and I hope they have competitive rates. Dude, your American Patriots whichever thing has been hunting people since February.I would say that the US Congress members have nothing to fear from such poor hunters.I am sure this group has never had the taste of venison. Yes, just like the market correction for people wanting to buy Google stock at $560 per share.I am sure the small time investor who wants to invest is not willing to buy fractions of a share because it is awkward. This will probably bring the price down.Would it be easier for you if you were able to buy 2500 Satoshis for $1? Spent a few days here at this all inclusive resort in Turkey last month. Starting to get chilly, I bought an electric heated jacket. 100 billion!?!?That is insane. But hey, at least the funny dog logo is funny. Always a great thing for a currency.Heh...dog looking at you funny...classic. lol
Would you rather use something that is .4 times the dollar such as the mBTC?Or .000004 times the dollar such as Satoshis?Do you know that you do not have to actually buy a full bitcoin?Why would anyone spend dollars when a 1000 dollar bill is so expensive compared to an ounce of gold? Going back and forth between Bitcoin and fiat is the reason that currently the exchanges are the biggest money makers of all of the Bitcoin businesses.The potential is when we no longer need exchanges. From a recent purchase I made with bitcoins:Order summary   Apple iPhone 6 4.7-inch Dis...    $819.00    2,139.61 mBTC   Estimated Tax    $0.00    mBTC   Subtotal    $819.00    2,139.61 mBTC   Discount 33%    -$270.27    -706.07 mBTC   Fee 1%    $8.19    21.39 mBTC   Final price    $556.92    1,454.93 mBTC Teleportation would face many struggles of adoption as well. I bought an iPhone 6 for the equivalent of $550 worth of bitcoins.I spent bitcoins and someone purchased it for me with their credit card through purse.ioThat is why I "sold".I will buy more on Friday though. DOGE block reward is halving? What from 1 trillion per minute to 500 million per minute?Get rid of those things as fast as you can. If you have less then a quintillion of those things you have the equivalent of a penny. So...American Patriots Militia Groups are really bad hunters? Where can I find my closest FEMA camp so I can get the best cot before everyone else is rounded up? There is a number on blockchain.info (I can't access it right now). I believe their assumed cost of electricity is a bit on the high side. You could "download" the entire blockchain via carrier pigeon.Something similar was done by putting a USB drive on a pigeon's foot and sending him over a few hundred miles.They calculated the data rate and it was a pretty competitive speed. If BTC was the main economic currency, it would not be volatile. A whale with $10 million might be able to move the price by a penny. BitPay has taken the easy part...receiving a currency that does not have chargebacks and paying out in a currency that allows chargebacks.Doing the opposite exposes the provider to chargebacks. Bitcoin is much like the electric car, if all cars were electric there would not be as much reliance upon foreign oil, wars over oil would dry up, oil companies would not be as powerful as they are, people who produce their own electricity would not be reliant upon an outside entity for their transportation, etc...In theory it is nice but then the reality of it comes in. There is no national infrastructure in place to charge electric cars, people are used to gas vehicles and are not willing to switch over mainly because everything is set up for gas cars.I was involved in the electric car community in the late 90s and it was much like the early days of Bitcoin. People converting their cars to electric, complaining about the big companies ignoring the benefits, trying to figure out the chicken and egg problem of getting charging stations up all over the place to charge non-existent electric cars that weren't being created because there aren't charging stations all over the place.Then the hybrids started using some of the electric car technology. They tried to make it as close to a gas car as they could, hiding as much of the electric aspect from the user as they could since that is what they were familiar with. Prius used it to get better gas mileage using recharging brakes and the efficiency of the electric motor at low speeds and quick acceleration. The first ones took some time for people to get used to, there was a distrust of electric cars and a knowledge gap. Some hard core enthusiasts added more batteries and converted the Prius into a plug in hybrid showing Toyota how it could be done, begging for them to implement the plug in aspect so you could drive short distances without the need for gas. The first plug in vehicles were confusing to most consumers, die hard electric people were enthusiastic, commercials had to be made to show that it was simple and not all electric (only optional).Tesla used the concept of focusing on a community that would be willing to adopt a fully electric car while making it cool, they went after the sports car industry where people are willing to put up with some mechanical issues or comfort for something that's fast, looks good and is new. They used the initially high priced vehicles to fund their more consumer oriented vehicles and have been working to put the infrastructure in place for electric vehicles across the country. This should make it easier for future electric car adoption and allow for more companies to start putting out fully electric cars.Bitcoin is in the early stages of the hybrid phase. Companies are willing to use the good parts of it to help their fiat business, trying not to scare their consumers with the technological aspects of Bitcoin that they may be afraid of. The hybridization is not the most efficient and does not use the full utility of Bitcoin but is what the consumer is currently willing to accept.We need a Tesla equivalent that can focus on a small focused part of the economy that is most willing to use it and make it look cool and then turn around and use that to grow and set up the infrastructure for the pure Bitcoin economy. Let us assume that a country wants to make Bitcoin it's legal currency. Or it wants to pass a law specifically about Bitcoin.How could it legally be defined?Could they just say "Our country recognizes the following currencies to be legal forms of exchange <current currency>, bitcoin, ..."With its decentralized nature and evolving blockchain, would there not be a requirement to have some sort of central authority which would continue to update the definition of Bitcoin? What if there is a branch off due to a code change, something is added and some miners accept it and some do not. What source of the code would be considered the "official" source? etc..So far countries have been able to just group "cryptocurrencies or digital currencies" into one group which covers many things. But at some point it will probably be necessary to legally define Bitcoin. Not just as a country's currency but via contract disputes, payment agreements, property laws, etc... They were a contributing factor. I was not around for the jump to $32 but the explanation for that one was that all of the Bitcoiners believed the Bitcoin would be huge and when the price started going up they thought "this is it" and drove the price up with wild enthusiasm.We have had a few of those moments. Since the prize is 2 mbtc I will predict the price is $1,000,000.If it hits that price, this post is worth it and everyone will be kicking themselves for not replying. This was me...my first purchase was $10,000 worth of bitcoins at $17 each.I sold at the 17 month point. I had not thought of that. The linear rate will increase at each halving. But I think most people see an exponential increase of demand while I think over time it will be linear with small bursts as major developments take place.Over time the affect of inflation will level out when block reward is replaced more by transaction fees as the reward for finding a block. Yes, if inflation was not cut in half in 2012. There is usually a lot of speculation that the bitcoin price is exponential. While there are some instances of exponential price rise when there is a self fulfilling feedback loop of excitement over a price rise which brought us the $32, $266 and $1240 prices. If we step back and look over the long term you can see a linear price rise.http://i61.tinypic.com/b3u4wx.pngI split it in two to show before and after the price halving (and to go from MtGox to BitStamp).Old Pic http://i59.tinypic.com/2dtk4x.pngOlder Pic: http://i60.tinypic.com/vertj.pngThis would indicate that the true price should be around $500 (Dec. 2015) or so right now which would explain the recent uptrend from a long low price.There are a few positives from a linear price rise. It is less volatile, it makes sense for a currency and it continues to trend up.There is also a slight upward rise in the rate of price increase at the halving, which would indicate that in 2016 the rate will tick up a little more at the next halving.While an exponential rise is exciting and great if you get out at the top, a linear price rise is good in the long term.The formula would be close to this:P = 13.5t + 12where t = months since November 2012Before the halving the rate was closer to:P = .3t + 1 t being months from February 2010With the formula after the next halving:P = 20.25t + 660t being months from July 2016Edit:This actually does make the price exponential over time, the charts are showing the linear trend between halvings.
With a 6 month cool down period?There are 3 clear spikes in price over the last few years. We have never hit a previous high after a new spike in the price so we are close to the bottom. What price do you believe will be the low.Note: The trolls who have posted anything indicating that they have absolutely no confidence in Bitcoin are on my ignore list because I come here to discuss Bitcoin. I go to bankrate.com to find out how the dollar is doing. Bitcoin was down to almost $70 after its high of $266 (down almost 75% from the high).The price would have to be down to $310 for us to be at the same point of despair as April 2013.(And then there is 2011 when the price dropped 95% from its high of $32)Can you hang? Or he will wait until the price does not matter and spend it. "The Internet? Is that still around?"-Homer Simpson The champion of Keynes...the same theology that believes that governments should control money with war and guns. The same type of people who are against Bitcoin had this to say about the Internet in 1998:"The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law'which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participantsbecomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's." Welcome to Bitcoin! Every whale that drives the price down in the short term means that there are not large holders in the future.Satoshi starts selling and it will be like the price going down over the past few weeks.Then...it's all up from there. Bitcoin is up over 5% today. If it does that over the next year we will be at $50k.Very likely considering the price trend over the past 24 hours. Welcome to Bitcoin! The drug war funds terrorism more than Bitcoin ever could. Until I buy something with bitcoins.Then I would buy more when my paycheck goes through. Just now finding about about the inflationary nature of the first few years of Bitcoin?Did you know that 2 years ago the inflation was twice as high? There was enough adoption to keep the price rising.In 2 years the rate of inflation will be cut in half. That means the price will rise twice as high. What else have you done with Bitcoin other than buy and hold? I like this idea. And why stop with property? Many ugly men go their whole lives without having sex with a beautiful woman while good looking men have hot girlfriends. This is obviously unfair. Men with hot girlfriends need to give them up proportionally to ugly men a few times a month for sex to even things out. Same with good looking guys being required to have sex with ugly women. Equal rights for all. Nationalize it all. Hmm, dollartalk.org sounds like a good idea...I wonder how long it would take this time before the hosting services shut it down. Worst case scenario...Keynes was right! War and oppression is the best economic solution. I have no life with nothing but time on my hands.Does anyone know of a dollar speculating website where I can go on there and talk about how people should not buy dollars? Talk about how it will go to zero soon and spend my days just talking about the dollar...which I have absolutely no interest in other than wasting the huge amount of time that I have. Because I have no life. 2012 called, they want their failed comparison back
Silver went down because something new and better came along that does not require storing huge hunks of metal all over the place. Yes, so many nukes being traded daily for bitcoins.That is where the FBI coins are going. I can see Bitcoin being used for some anonymous campaigning, stuff that spreads the message without going through the usual channels.I recall during Ron Paul's campaign a guy set up a phone polling system that he had to pay for, he could get X amount of calls to voters for Y dollars...he had people send him money via PayPal to do the calls. People sent him some money, he made a lot of calls until the FEC contacted him and said they considered that a donation and that he could not exceed the maximum donation.If the same thing were done via bitcoins with the calls anonymized then money could be used to campaign without using the usual FEC channels. All completely illegal but unstoppable. Perhaps a decentralized Internet advertising method could come along that uses bitcoins which could be used as well. Pirate offered a similar deal and I don't remember how it ended but I assume everyone was happy in the end.Also, I notice that everyone in this thread defending it has a paid signature.   I need bitcoins. I live in Germany but get paid in dollars to my US bank account. It is insanely difficult to get money from my account to me. Bitcoin has made my life a lot easier. And the more it is used, a lot of people will be able to enjoy the benefits. Here is the coindesk article on the study:http://www.coindesk.com/mit-report-bitcoin-more-likely-spent-hoarded/ When you are kidnapped, cooperate with your captors if it will result in your freedom. Even McCain cooperated with the Vietnamese when he was a prisoner to get through his captivity.There is no shame in taking the shortest path toward freedom. There have been charts including this one by MIT: That is why I do not worry about recruiting just anyone to come use Bitcoin.The new economy does not need to be run by the old guard and idiots. The world was made a better place thanks to Hal Finney's efforts.I hope his family knows how much this community appreciates him.Will they have a service even if he is being preserved?If so, an address to send flowers would be good. Yep...and was seen as sufficient evidence to air on international television. Some government stooge mentions in it that "the number I heard was that 20% of all narcotics transactions went through Silk Road".According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade narcotics are 1% of global trade.So...Bitcoin has reached .2% of all global trade?Global trade being $36 trillion.So...Bitcoin is being used for about $700 billion worth of trade...in drugs alone! Not sure if they play this segment often but it is always good to get some more exposure in Europe.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OzDI2z72NE At least 240,000 hotels started accepting bitcoin when Expedia started accepting it.Whether they convert it to fiat or not, it has been great for paying for hotels for me (getting reimbursed by my company will be interesting). Have you tried spending bitcoin? That is fun. Best ATM is one that you can deposit cash for bitcoins and get cash for bitcoins.Some are like vending machines where you can only do one or the other. If you are worried about an end to the Internet, pledge some bitcoins to the Bitcoin solar mesh network (YOUR PLEDGE AMOUNT STAYS IN YOUR WALLET).http://www.bitpools.com/?Solar%20Wireless%20Relay I notice that most new users are here looking for ways to get rich off of Bitcoin. It's like Steve Jobs and his buddies created the personal computer, took all the risk and got the company running, started making big money and now people are buying the computer and sitting in front of it waiting for it to make them rich too.Have you read the white paper?https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfDo you understand the whole point of Bitcoin and what it does for the world? Or are you just hearing about early adopters making a lot of money and you want to buy some bitcoins now so you can sell it later for more money and go back to your fiat world a richer person (though poorer in the long run for living in a fiat economy)? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love Bitcoin is to know and love the fact that Bitcoin is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a millibit, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of Bitcoin and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of Bitcoin are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.Let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters: the man who damns Bitcoin has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.Run for your life from any man who tells you that Bitcoin is evil. That sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one anothertheir only substitute, if they abandon Bitcoin, is the muzzle of a gun.But Bitcoin demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their Bitcoin and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being richwill not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guiltand of his life, as he deserves.Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standardthe men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted Bitcointhe men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-lawmen who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victimsthen Bitcoin becomes its creators avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once theyve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the hacker. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the barometer of a societys virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsionwhen you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothingwhen you see that Bitcoin is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favorswhen you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws dont protect you against them, but protect them against youwhen you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrificeyou may know that your society is doomed. Bitcoin is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying Bitcoin, for Bitcoin is mens protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers deny Bitcoin and only allow a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Bitcoin has an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, Account overdrawn.'When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, Who is destroying the world?' You are.You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why its crumbling around you, while youre damning its life-bloodBitcoin. You look upon Bitcoin as the savages did with gold before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout mens history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the love of money being evil, which you repeat with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slavesslaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebodys mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepersas industrialists.To the glory of mankind, there was, for a brief time in history, a country of moneyand I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to early America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, mans mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human beingthe self-made manthe American industrialist.If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choosebecause it contains all the othersthe fact that they were the people who created the phrase to make money. No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantityto be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words to make money hold the essence of human morality.Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters continents. Now the looters credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the bitcoin and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide as, I think, he will.Until and unless you discover that Bitcoin is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When Bitcoin ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns....or bitcoins. Take your choicethere is no otherand your time is running out. Just like my 75 year old mother likes to send letters once or twice a year...some people will enjoy using their dollars (though it will probably be hundreds of dollars) to buy things. They will eventually go the way of those that still paid for things in gold pieces until fiat replaced them.
There will still be some people who use fiat currencies.Would you like me to mail you a letter with more thoughts on this? Or you could read my editorial in the newspaper the next time you sit down and flip through the pages. Unfortunately I am in a holding pattern on buying more bitcoins. I just moved from Afghanistan to Germany and when trying to change my cell phone number for verification on Coinbase it has taken them over a week of verifying my change. After having gone a few weeks without a phone. I have a lot of bitcoins to buy once I get set back up.It has been great being able to pay for my hotel rooms on Expedia. I am now a gold member, they should have a level above that called bitcoin member  It appears that a crime was committed. The one individual that committed such a horrible act should be prosecuted. It looks like a major debate about Scotland's independence revolves around their future currency.England is trying to intimidate Scotland into not leaving by saying they can't keep using the pound. The big businesses are not liking this because they don't want to pay conversion fees whenever they do international sales.There is also discussion of what part of Great Britain's debt that Scotland should be on the hook for.My opinion:Time for Scotland to adopt Bitcoin as their national currency.If not officially, it needs to be adopted by the people. And the government should accept it for payments. All based on the false premise promoted by so called economists who would never begin to "get" bitcoin. Also the false premise that people will not spend their virtual currency. The numbers prove such a premise wrong...so very very wrong... I just sold all of my dollars. Thank you. It is the strongest military today because it is paid for with higher and higher debt that cannot be maintained.The dollar is a liability backed solely by the military which exists solely because countries are willing to borrow our dollars.When that stops it all comes falling down. This is 8 years in Zimbabwe currency: Dollars would be gone centuries before bitcoin goes away. I could see the price of bitcoin going to $0.I mean, how many people would pay bitcoins for confederate currency?When I was in Iraq there would be stacks of old Iraqi currency sitting on the shelves. They were practically giving it away. Fiat currency will be free, no need to pay bitcoins for it. Unless it comes in a cool frame or something...but then you are just paying for the presentation of it. I started with Bitcoin 4 years ago. At that time it could be used on a handful of sites.Now I spend more with bitcoins than I do with fiat. Pulling out my credit card when buying something online is very rare.Price != BitcoinStart using it, the price is irrelevant. Spent trillions on meddling in the business of other countries. Ruined our economy and set us up for more US hatred around the world. He turned a world that was sympathetic after 9/11 to a world of fear/disgust at our actions afterwards.Liberty was sacrificed under Bush, economically and socially.I await your response about how bad Obama is. Completely ignoring the fact that Bush spent trillions on his own pursuits. It takes all kinds....the ignore suggestion made on another thread is a clearer path in the cosmos At least 10% off of all Amazon purchases at purse.io too. Phase 6....da moon Bitcoin is not for buying and selling.It is for earning and spending.  I so wanted to buy when it was down around $460 but I changed phone numbers on CoinBase and it takes 48 hours to review the change.I missed the window on really cheap coins but will still be buying when I get my account back. Bears and bulls alike easily have their arguments shut down when the price has been climbing or falling. There is not much you can say about the direction when every response is "do you see which way the price has been going the past few days/weeks?!?!".  I don't think the difference has much to do with pregnancy as it does with the culture/human nature and what is valued more by men and woman.While there are certainly exceptions, men mainly seek beautiful women when seeking a mate. Women tend to seek a man that can provide security (today that is mainly financial security).Consider Oprah...how many men would seek her out as a mate? She's super wealthy, she would provide for your every need. Do you buy magazines checking out pictures of her and keep up with her latest relationships?Look at Nick Cage...he is one ugly dude. Yet he is successful and some women would love to be married to him.Just like a woman will go out of her way to make herself look beautiful in order to attract a mate, a man will go out of his way to become successful to get a mate.Also, you need just look at the IT industry where the salaries are much higher on average and you will see very few women. I know my computer science classes were usually all men except for about 2 or 3 females...and 2 were Chinese or Indian.
While the Navy is useful, they have not played a dominant role in these past two wars. Cutting the navy down is inevitable. They did too well at eliminating any sea battles. If I had two exact resumes in front of me. One a woman asking for $770 for the project and one a man asking for $1,000 I would hire the woman.So...does that mean that unemployment is higher for men?If I have a project that requires programming and an American and an Indian apply for it. I check both of their work. If they are both the same I would hire the American. Not for any patriotic reason but because I have found that Americans tend to work to achieve what you want...not what you ask. If you know what I mean. I am speaking of programming here. However, more often than not the Indian is about half the price of the American so I go with the cheaper rate. Thanks for the info. I signed up for their site and will work on getting an account set up. Actually I don't think it has really changed much. People were a lot more optimistic before with no way to make money from the price going down.So almost every thread was about "TO THE MOON!".Of course the price was way more volatile then too...it jumped from $2 to $32 based on pure speculation.Now you can make just as much money from the price dropping so you have both types of idiots. Hello, I just moved to Germany and need to open a bank account. Is there any that are the "best" when it comes to using Bitcoin?I am thinking more along the lines of easy transfers to bitstamp and other transfers. While avoiding those that may have been cracking down on users' accounts. There are some people who just don't "get it". They do not deserve to buy bitcoins at these low prices and you will not need to worry about them in a few years (if you can get away from them and protect yourself from them).I will see you on a beach somewhere where like minded people will thrive. Republicrat vs Republicrat...so many choices. It is questions like this that are the reason many early adopters sold at prices like $32, $100, $200, etc...If you actually understand the purpose of Bitcoin then the answer is never.If you are in Bitcoin just to make some quick money to cash out into fiat then you still don't 'get it' http://investors.overstock.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=131091&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1950949=We are pleased to have returned to double digit revenue growth while delivering our 10th profitable quarter in a row. In addition, our increases in technology spending have supported an innovation cycle that has spun up to the point that we can conceive and execute on ideas much faster than at any previous time in our existence. A good example of this is the credit facility that we started offering customers this week, on competitive, and in some cases, significantly stronger terms than Amazon offers on its store card. Other examples from 2014 include Bitcoin, Pet Adoptions, Insurance, and Supplier Oasis Fulfillment Services (which is an alternative to Amazon Fulfillment Services at a fraction of the price). Barring exogenous events, I anticipate that our innovative efforts will continue gathering momentum. Meh, I'll still get it though hopefully competition will kill the monthly fee. A decent rise in the BTC price will make $5 a month seem like nothing.I pay $150 per year for my Amex. I'll just drop that and use Xapo. In Russia bitcoin bans you! There certainly are a whole lot of people giving the same advice my financial adviser was giving me in 2010.Fortunately I did not listen to him.Stick with your old fiat ways of investing. You may be able to retire when you are 75 with enough to die slowly.  Bitcoin will not save countries.It will save people. This is the double secret ban we all hoped would never happen.Next step:triple ban Someone was mentioning on another thread how all of these people who used to post years ago still hardly have any bitcoins.That is because they said things like "I'll cash it all out when it hits $30!"So now they sit here having cashed out when they made some money. Maybe paid off a credit card or two.I never understand these threads...what am I supposed to cash out to? People not even close to being as humble or smart as Satoshi trying to be Satoshi. I actually agree with you but for new people it saves us all from the sob stories when the price moves around. Not sure if there are just a lot more newbies around that do not know the basics or what is going on here but I am noticing a lot of ignorant posts lately so I will post some basic common sense things that any Bitcoin user should know.1. Do not invest more than you are willing to lose. (ok, we got that over with...no need to repeat it every thread about investing in Bitcoin)2. Do not trust a third party website to hold your coins.3. Keep your coins in cold storage. Other than coins you plan on spending that day/week/month.4. Encrypt your bitcoin wallet, use 2 factor authentication for any website where you have your spending money.5. Always use escrow when you buy or sell something from/to someone.6. Altcoins, gambling and IPOs are a good quick way to lose money7. Everyone you don't know personally tries to take your coins.  Consider every project a scam until PROVEN other.Any other obvious things people should know that has been covered over and over but missed by new users? Bitcoin is much more secure than debit and credit cards.Nobody with any sense puts more bitcoins on their phone than they would put cash in their wallet.
Would we have to forget some of those transactions? Like how some of the initial transactions done by Satoshi are so famous?Memory wipe as well? Hmm, so we have this ledger with every Bitcoin transaction going back to the beginning. Every 10 minutes a new block is added to show the latest transactions.Then some "kill switch" does what exactly? Wipes out the ledger? On everyone's computer? Even those that are turned off? Even those not connected to the Internet?It would be harder to do than wipe out all bank accounts of all banks, all stocks, bonds, etc in the whole world. If as many drug deals were done with bitcoins as the media and governments claim are done we'd be up over $100k/bitcoin. Maybe some sort of multi-sig technology.If only such a thing existed. Nanotechnology companies creating advanced products are unfair to those working as burger flippers. Move thread to alt section to die. On my cold storage computer I only burn CDs and read them on my networked machine.No USB. I agree, everyone hold your bitcoins and do not do anything until we are told what the price will be. Hopefully some government authority will tell us what to do like they do with the rest of our lives.  I don't day trade, I stopped doing that after going from about 800 bitcoins to 400 bitcoins as it jumped all over from $17 to $2 and up and down all over the place in between.I buy the equivalent in bitcoins of what I spend in fiat. I took my dogs to the vet, went out to eat, went to the dump and spent some money toward my vacation next week so I bought the equivalent amount of bitcoins for those purchases. So, if given the choice would you keep your money in the Argentina Peso or bitcoins? A few more after this price drop. If you mean that Bitcoin is loosing its popularity in the way that pants are loose with plenty of room to expand then I would say that Bitcoin is loose with plenty of room for growth of more popularity. To take out Bitcoin you have to destroy all computers in the whole world. A solar flare would mainly affect one side of the planet.Bitcoin would continue on the other side.  Ever bought a smart phone, computer, other electronic device that you knew would go down in price soon after you purchased it?Why didn't you save your money and wait for the price to go down? Why would you ever spend your money on something that loses value? Just hold and you can buy that device 2 years later when you could afford to buy 10, 20 of them with the same amount of currency. The more whales dump their bitcoins, the less people can complain about the small amount of people holding so many bitcoins. I will cash out enough to pay for my mortgage. For tax purposes I would spread that out over 2 years. Why would you hold fiat long enough to spend it if you could instead gain value during that same time?And the idea of hoarding is losing ground daily. People used to hoard because there was not much else to do with bitcoins. Now there are more and more uses. I funded most of my vacation using bitcoins from the hotel to the air fare. The point is that you are able to live off of bitcoins.The fact that Dell uses a third party to handle bitcoin transactions makes the bitcoin purchase no less useful to bitcoin holders than if you were sending directly to a Dell bitcoin address. Same with a gift card company handling your bitcoin transaction in the physical world.
If GOOG was appreciating as much as Bitcoin every year and you could buy things with it, why would you hold fiat?If you convert every paycheck to bitcoins then that money appreciates before you spend it.If you do not convert every paycheck then that fiat just loses value until you spend it. You don't need fiat to buy groceries at Whole Foods, Target and a bunch of restaurants.http://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-cards/whole-foods-market/ Or convert to the bitcoin currency and use it as much as possible. You get so many discounts from using bitcoins that using fiat currency is a disadvantage. EMP attack on the United States will take out a world currency? Bitcoin is a currency, are Europeans stupid to have their life savings in Euros or Americans stupid to have their life savings in dollars? Who would invest their life savings in fiat currency? Not sure why you would back up your wallet.dat online. That sort of defeats the purpose of everything else.Also, your fingerprint scanner saves the fingerprint data on your computer actually making it less secure if you actually use it instead of passwords.For me I have a separate computer that I never ever put online, it comes with physical hard drive encryption. The BIOS is password protected, the hard drive is password protected and the Linux I installed is encrypted and password protected. That is all before getting to the Linux login.The only thing installed on there is the Bitcoin Core which I used to create Public and Private keys which are stored in an encrypted file on the computer.I create a separate file with just the public keys which I then burn to a CD-R.I move the CD-R to my online computer. I send my bitcoins to the addresses on that list breaking it up into small amounts as to not attract attention to a big address. I literally just burned all CDs with any public addresses in a fire yesterday. I do not trust USB drives as I do not trust that there could not be extra software built into the hardware or part of the USB software (look up thumb drives and how Iran's Nuclear facilities were infiltrated).I do keep some bitcoins online for day to day spending but if those were stolen it is not enough to be too upset about even though I use 2FA.  So the World Bank is not a ponzi as long as they have the power of guns to force people to keep using their product. Without that power people would stop using it and it would all collapse.Bitcoin has no such guns forcing people to use it.Is this a distinct disadvantage of Bitcoin? Should we start pushing for the backing of guns so that we can compete with banks? more electoral votes from the rest of California outside of San Fran and LA would help us all. Ya, I didn't realize how cool the Koch brothers were until I watched a Chris Hayes (is that the MSNBC liberal dude's name?) hit piece on them telling about their history. Talked about his time in the Libertarian Party, their fight for free market economics, etc.I used to think they were two rich douches trying to take over Ron Paul's Tea Party movement. I will still reserve judgement until I do my own research but they don't really affect me so there's no need. The very idea of race is a collectivist notion.Obsessing about collectives is a weakness shared by racists. Only one person (probably OP) voted Yes. Does not matter.1 bitcoin could be used for the economy of a small country. "What the Tea Party is."  -Author: someone who doesn't know what the Tea Party is but wants you to believe what they think the Tea Party is as to discredit it. In the early 1900s people used pennies for every day purchases.They were not looking for alternatives because there were so few dollars in circulation.The early 1900s prices of "shave and a haircut, 2 bits (1 quarter)" is the future bitcoin "shave and a haircut, 2 millibits". If it has the same buying power as $3 million then it is.Considering there are over 6 billion people in the world, if bitcoin was the world currency the average wealth would be around 3 millibitcoins.If you buy 1 bitcoin right now, you will likely be rich in 10 years. Newegg....checkDell...checkIBM? I worked for them, they don't sell computers anymore (services and solutions). They sold their computers to Lenovo.Winklevoss ETF...coming soonWall Street...will probably come with the NY regulation and ETFsAmazon... http://purse.ioGetting there. Anyone who will take less for their tainted coins let me know.  Most of the companies I have worked with always buy dells. As more companies like this accept bitcoins, then companies that purchase their equipment via Dell will  be able to keep some of their bitcoin sales for making purchases.I also tend to tell family to buy a Dell when they ask me what kind of computer to buy. Sure I could give them an idea of the best hardware out there and what gives the best speed and performance, etc. But when it comes to just a simple computer that you can use to surf the web and open M$ Office documents, Dell does what it needs to do. People who hold dollars will lose them soon enough anyway. Look at all of the people in Zimbabwe who were millionaires. Now everyone in Zimbabwe is a millionaire. If the dollar crashes, it is not because bitcoin takes over...but because it failed as a currency. With the fortunate timing that bitcoin is there as a lifeboat, otherwise we would be like Germany and people would start trading in bottles of whiskey and cigarettes. You wouldn't blame the crash on booze and cigarettes.As bitcoin catches on, it will eventually replace certain percentages of the economy. Right now it is about .0001% of the economy. As people start using it it may move up to 1% of the economy. Reasonably that would mean that people might have 1% of their wealth in bitcoins. Once bitcoin reaches 10% of the economy people might have a few millibitcoins that they spend when it makes the most sense (paying for things online, sending money overseas, etc).As it reaches 50% of the economy, people getting new jobs will start asking to be paid in bitcoins as they see the benefits to the dollar. So it will be like living on the border of Mexico, you keep dollars and pesos and pay with whichever currency is used. As it approaches that 100% mark, most people will not be using the dollar anymore. The rich will still be rich because the reason they are rich is because they are good with their money and will notice the inflationary nature of the dollar and look for a sound alternative.Sure, if bitcoin replaces the dollar tomorrow, then you might have a point. But how would bitcoin replace the dollar tomorrow? It has to achieve gradual acceptance with more and more businesses accepting it and more people getting paid in bitcoin before that will ever happen.
If bitcoin replaces all other currencies...what will people be paid in? You have a point considering people can only buy in denominations of 1 bitcoin at a time. And when it comes to spending no less than 1 bitcoin is accepted.I have never considered this. If only bitcoin was divisible into much smaller units. Alas...Satoshi let us down on that one. According to the MonkeySphere the optimum community size is about 150 people.http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html Party A will blame Party B. Party B will blame Party A.In war, the truth is always the first casualty. Bitcoin will eventually be bitcoin 2.0.It is bitcoin .9.2.1 right now. So the World Bank isnt a bank. It is [by the way] a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isnt safe given war funding destabilizing nations.The main value of the World Bank may, in retrospect, turn out to be the lessons it offers bitcoins on the prospects of banking, and on how to enhance efficiency and cut transactions cost. OP's website is "Buy Bitcoin with Paypal".I would hate Bitcoin too after trying to sell a non-refundable currency via a haphazardly refundable payment processor.  Welcome to Bitcoin, I suggest you read the White Paperhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf Yes, if you want an industrial modern country it will cost more than $10 million.20 large properties where each owner is on his own to build whatever they want? Much less.I already explained electricity. As for water, I live on the Gulf of Mexico where people can't build wells like those inland. Initially those living on the water got their water delivered from a company inland. Over time they built pipes. I ran for the water commission (our water company is a private cooperative), the yearly cost for about 10,000 residents runs about $1 million per year paid for by water bills. This includes buying land for building wells, a team of 3 guys installing and maintaining the pipes and a staff of 2 or 3 people in the main office.Everything you mention that involves more than the first 20 people includes people..people bringing revenue. Revenue that pays for infrastructure.Want to build Jersey or Singapore with all of its infrastructure within the first year? Yep...that would be pricey. I agree that such a crazy idea should not be attempted.Starting small with basic services probably with some eco-tourism living in cabins doing some fishing and hiking? Totally do-able.You are right though as you mentioned in another thread. Those that talk about it probably don't even have any bitcoins in the first place.For those that do and want to make it happen, pledge your bitcoins (keeping your BTC in your wallet) here: http://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20Island Getting some great rates at these low prices. One exchange just had a $40 million investment. That could pay for 4 large islands.A single bitcoin island would have the media attention of millions of dollars in advertisement. It would be a demonstration of how effective Bitcoin is and demonstrate real world solutions uninhibited by government regulations. http://www.ilo.org/oshenc/part-vii/environmental-health-hazards/item/498-developing-countries-and-pollutionThird world countries still rely on diesel, wood, etc. for fuel. They aren't even close to thinking about solar, wind or hydro due to the economic investment required. All of what effort? A few dozen people focusing on a project?Should we shut down all small bitcoin projects and focus on making the whole world use bitcoins? Not just one person's if the land is purchased by people pooling their money and voting using the blockchain toward what they want.And the infrastructure can be created by others pooling their money toward different investments.Billions are not needed for a small island with 20-30 land owners renting to visitors or selling out parcels.20 people pledging 50 bitcoins each when the bitcoin price hits $10k then they have $10 million for the purchase.That would be enough for this 36,000 acre island:http://www.privateislandsonline.com/islands/ilha-das-pacasA similar amount of 20 people pledging 50 bitcoins would be enough for a solar array with electricity sent to each of the 20 1,800 acre properties. Maybe even doing solar roads instead of a solar array to kill two birds with one stone. For those that are actually serious about this, if you want to put your bitcoins where your mouth is sign up for the Bitcoin Island discussion here:http://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20IslandThere is also a discussion for those that want to invest in land:http://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20Island%20LandownersAnd those that want to invest in development and infrastructure:http://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20Island%20Developers The best thing we can do for the environment is promote Bitcoin so that all of these third world countries can grow their economies and modernize. Still about $100 more expensive. I think it was because of the specific flight to a small airport. The other sites like travelocity and expedia also had higher rates. I did an extensive search. I will add btctrip.com to my list though. Thanks.I currently have no rent and bills (living on a military base) but next month when I get out I will add that to my routine. It will encourage me to get a cheaper apartment instead of getting too greedy.I will use bitcoins as much as possible, mainly because I enjoy how easy it is to spend compared to filling out a form with my credit card information.As for how I can afford it. I'm single. I am just finishing 20 months in Afghanistan as a defense contractor making a lot of money working 12 hour days, 7 days a week. I spent most of those 20 months putting all of my money into bitcoins (after I paid off all credit cards and other debts). Now I head to Germany where my company will give me money toward housing. I have downsized my life to be able to fit all of my belongings into a carry-on bag and a backpack. I don't plan on spending a lot on material items unless I absolutely need it or don't care about donating it when I'm done with it. You are describing safecoin if it ever gets going.It's not like we need to cover the globe in order to turn things on. A small network in major cities connected through an encrypted tunnel via the ISPs will be fine for a long time in most places.But think of places like China where their Internet is severely censored. This is likely to be the way of things everyone else. Government likes to fill spaces where it is not involved. The Internet is like a vacuum of freedom that will be filled by government regulation eventually. Ahh good ol' Russian propaganda. 80s flashback.
If you want a tax you must accept that you are willing to force someone to involuntarily give up their rightfully earned property. Otherwise known as theft.Why do so many people accept forcing someone to do something against their will as the right thing to do? So you are saying...the rich will eventually leave the 'clubs' that are giving away free stuff to those who can't afford it?Like how people tend to emigrate from states with high taxes and move to low tax states?Perhaps we should build walls to keep the rich in? Welcome to Stalin's Russia. Our modern, free, police system is a relatively new concept. Even in the old movies you see the private detectives. Before that it was usually just a constable or sheriff.Btw...pay or we shoot you (kidnap you if you don't resist) is what we have now. The only fee should be payment for citizenship and all that comes with it.It should be like paying for membership into a club. All benefits are outlined up front, you can join or not.You want free education, police protection, fire department services, etc. You pay up front like a package deal.Otherwise, you pay for those things separately. Can't afford it? Don't join the citizen club.Don't think the benefits of joining are worth the money? Don't join the citizen club.Want all the free stuff that comes with being a citizen without paying anything? Go find a citizenship club that gives you all of that stuff for free without payment. I have started a new approach to my spending habits.Every time I spend money, I buy the equivalent amount of bitcoins.I booked my flight for a vacation (used Lufthansa.com because the price was a lot lower than cheapair.com) which cost about $630. So after booking the flight I went to Coinbase and bought 1 bitcoin.I paid for the hotel with bitcoins on Expedia for 3 bitcoins. So I turned around and bought 6 bitcoins on Coinbase after that.Doing it this way, I will be forced to save 50% of all of my spending. And if the price of bitcoin doubles I will have paid for all of my spending up to that point.And if I spend bitcoins, it does not matter if the price is low when I spend it and goes up after the purchase. That just means I gained money. I refer to the locals. Having been deployed to Iraq and currently being in Afghanistan I have seen the biohazard left behind after a local has had access to the facilities. If you can't figure out how to flush a toilet, figuring out Bitcoin might be a bit of a stretch.As for not being able to read, it is well known that less than 20% of the Afghanis are literate. For you maybe.It has ended my use of the fed. Just point me to the website where I can get a fiat loan from the Federal Reserve at its lowest interest rate with pre-inflated dollars that I can then invest before that inflation propagates throughout the economy (with the poor being the last ones to spend it, after the prices are all inflated).No such website? Hmm, but the rich have such access.The poor have just as much access to buying bitcoins as anyone. Most of them can't even read, they don't even know how to sit down on the toilet to shit. Just because someone can think of a theoretical way that something can be done, does not mean that it has the real world possibility of being done.ISIS could use nanotechnology to carry a virus through the air, inject it into your blood stream then duplicate and fly on to the next person! two fiddy This is a smart approach that should be attempted wherever the ATM software allows it.I know my bank has a separate key for buying stamps. Likely an agreement between the bank and the post office to add software to make it easy to buy stamps.I am sure it would be just as easy to create another button for buying bitcoins. Actually easier since I assume the ATM requires special hardware to spit out a stamp. For bitcoins you just need the receipt to have your address and QR code. Step 1: Watch the blockchain for any huge transactions from one address to anotherStep 2: Claim that a huge transaction was actually stolen money from my addressStep 3: ?? your idea ??Step 4: Profit! Clone of a clone of a clone... You can download the full bitcoin blockchain at bitcoin.org Altcoins are a good example of why copyrights and patents are not necessary.If you get the product right first, then you enjoy first comer status and there is no need to artificially protect your product. helllooo....tax purposesit's always best to lose money when it comes to taxes Seriously, I would like to know.I can only think of paying developers and paying for a lobbyist. Anything else? Why would I sell at $1100?Way too low. I can't even pay off my mortgage with that. There is a huge limit to their sophistication. They are much better at loading a truck full of guys with guns than using the Internet to do much of anything.Look at how few Americans with computers and smartphones are using Bitcoin. Do you really think a bunch of Syrians and Iraqis will be paying for things with bitcoins any time soon?There are many technological advances in the world that they could use to their advantage (nanotechnology, quantum computing, DNA mapping, etc.). There is a huge gap between what "could" be done and what is likely.I won't hold my breath for widespread Bitcoin use among Iraqis. Except Bolivia didn't ban Bitcoin.OP is trolling.
This is already all possible at BitPools voting with the blockchain.What are some Bitcoin Foundation things that need funding? I'll create some Pools so people can join, fund and vote on the funding. Simple answer.No Bolivia did not ban WoW and Diablo gold.However, the banks have said they will not use WoW and Diablo gold for their financial transactions.And by saying "they will not use WoW and Diablo gold", they said they will only use government currencies in their bank transactions. What is to change? It's just a label. Bitcoin does not change one bit.At http:www.bitpools.com all the labels are in mBTC.It is up to people who use it to call it what they want. I think the first step would be to design the software (some open source solutions already available) and factor in paying for it with bitcoins.Then from there we can ramp up to the hardware.With hardware requirements we can have an open source hardware platform that people can then start creating themselves and someone can start mass producing similar to mining hardware companies.One big decision would be the way to charge.Is it better to charge for time with a set "pipe" of limited bandwidth, or charge for blocks of data usage?TimePros:Most people are used to paying per minute for phones or per month or per day/week, etc.The longer the time for subscription, the less Bitcoin transactions neededCons:If a network connection is not highly utilized, limiting the connection of someone trying to move large amounts of data is unnecessary.There would only be a certain amount of "reserved" slots per connection to guarantee users' access to the pipe.UsagePros:Each connection can serve as many users as it wants at full capacityYou only pay for what you use, if you don't send or receive much data you don't pay as much as network hogsIt encourages software/habits to not use as much data for transfersCons:Most people prefer to just pay on a subscription basis and not have to worry about how much data they're usingPeople using a lot of data regularly like gamers or skype or netflix or other large transfers will have to pay moreDiscouraging usage might not make economic sense for a system set up to get paid for usageThoughts? BitPay is working on a beta service to make it easy for employers to pay you in bitcoins. Similar how they allow companies to accept bitcoins without any hassle. And the reason (other than the obvious...OP) why this is in the Speculation forum? I took my phone full of bitcoins to the bank and tried to make a deposit.Not only did the cashier advise against doing that, the bank manager said she is prohibited from depositing my bitcoins into my bank account!Wells Fargo prohibits bitcoins! 304 kmhttp://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1984314/wi-fi-world-record-set-304kmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-FiYes, it has to be line of site.link first established on 2007-06-16it appears to be permanent from Monte Amiata (Tuscany) to Monte Limbara (Sardinia)frequency: 5765 MHzIEEE 802.11a (Wi-Fi), bandwidth 5 MHzRadio: Ubiquiti Networks XR5Wireless routers: MikroTik RouterBOARD with RouterOS, NStreme optimization enabledLength: 304 km (189 mi).Antenna is 120 cm with handmade waveguide. 35 dBi estimated Cellphones. If you move from the US and convert your USD to EUR are you now a speculator in euros? Instead of explaining this.Create a BitFinex account.Load up some bitcoins.Loan out some bitcoins.Get paid.I made about 1 BTC earlier this year over the course of about 2-3 weeks loaning bitcoins on BitFinex (while the price was falling). When the reward halves in 2016 we will get another upturn in the direction of the price.Like it did after going from 50 to 25. So does this mean that all of these alt coin miners will be converting their alt coins en masse to bitcoins so they can buy new hardware on newegg?Bitcoin price to all alt coin prices is about to rise. PayPal actually does that shit?Wow...they will be gone so soon. I'm waiting for the LG G3 price to come down a few bucks and I'll go ahead and buy it on NewEgg.I did see that the price is a few percent lower on Amazon but the Amazon companies all ship from South Korea. Not sure if the phones are different coming from Korea or not. I have created a Bitcoin Pool for anyone who wants to see something like this developed.Signing up is easy, you only need 10 mBTC to join the discussion (the 10 mBTC stays in your wallet).http://www.bitpools.com/?Video%20GameWith enough interest we can get something working. Let's do this.BitPools is made for gathering funding among people interested in the same project so that someone with a solution is willing to put something together for the group.Here's an example of how it would work for developing a video game:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY That is why I usually do not waste any time convincing liberals to buy bitcoins...they can enjoy the system they prop up. so begins the explosion When people wake up in the US to see that NewEgg is accepting bitcoin it will fly past 666 into the 700s.
Perfect fit. They will receive my business. Whatever dufus is wasting his coins to make some silly 666 reference is even more of an idiot because they found out that the real number of the beast is 999. Great thread...OP talks about marketing the fact that you can earn interest on a currency that is not inflationary and it is followed by half the posts talking about how it cannot be done.It is being done people.Welcome to Bitcoin, have a look around. Antennas using 802.11n have been able to achieve transmission distances over 300 km unamplified. There was a linked child porn image put in years ago. The issue was already checked. Legally nobody is liable for having it in the blockchain.Child porn images pass through ISPs daily and they have not been raided even though the bits existed on their routers.Nice try. The price will be higher and higher, buy now instead of trying to get cheap coins. That's what we're discussing right now. Welcome to the discussion. Still using dial up to connect to the Internet?Or are you enjoying the benefits of the greedy companies that want to offer more and more speed to make money? I like the part about having your bitcoin address tied to your computer. You could have your connecting client sign a transaction for verification.I do like how the closer you get to the "real" Internet the higher the cost because of the assumed better bandwidth.But there should be a way to pay (and charge) for the best speeds and higher traffic. This would encourage people to be like miners and upgrade their hardware often with the final result being blazing fast network speeds and high data ceilings. I think he means a Dutch oven.Similar but very different. That was me, I just pulling some change out of my couch. Converted them to bitcoins. Bolivia has only banned using bitcoins on its banks national payment system.Like Visa banning using bitcoins over its credit card network or banks banning the use of bitcoins for wire transfers.Essentially.Bolivia has not banned bitcoins! I get out of Afghanistan in 3 weeks.It's time for me to plant my seed too... I could see something like a "subscription" base for nodes connecting to nodes.Each node pays for X amount of bandwidth up front to another node. That node does not know if it is a relay or a user connecting. Something like .01 BTC for 10Gb of data transfer. Once that amount is used up, the node or user has to pay again. This has been shown to be a viable way of paying for Internet service with bitcoins.You could set the amount you want and your nodes could seek out the best rate among nodes. Users could also seek out the best nodes to connect to for their Internet access.If a node is getting paid a lot for traffic it then has to pay other nodes for the traffic needs from them.There could be different levels of access for short term access like in an airport where you only need 10Mb or so, or higher subscriptions for major hubs.The market would push the rates down as anyone can drop in a node and set their price.  translation:BOARD RESOLUTION No. 044/2014 SUBJECT: MANAGEMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS - BAN USE OF COINS AND CURRENCY NO NAMES REGULATED IN THE FIELD OF PAYMENT SYSTEM NACIONAL.VISTOS: The Political Constitution of Estado.La Law No. 1670 of October 1995, the Central Bank of Bolivia BCB 31.)

Bolivia Central Bank bans bitcoins on their payment system ie. No sending bitcoins from bank to bank, over wire transfers, etc. Early on it could certainly tunnel through the current Internet. Free indoctrination, cheap rounding up of the poor to be kept away from the rich people and training people to be dependent upon the government so they will grant that government more power.Many US comradescitizens love the US government. Anonymous does not have web pages that collect e-mail addresses.They put instructions on Tor or 4chan or places like that. Of the top reasons for murder, people are not usually in the state of mind to even consider the death penalty. I doubt someone who is willing to murder would see much difference between living the rest of their lives in jail or dying. They do not value life much in the first place, why would you assume they value their own life?Then again, if we had the ten commandments in schools maybe people would read that one about "thou shalt not kill". But most people who are fighting to get those commandments into schools are fine with finding excuses to ignore that commandment.This should be left to the states to decide. As murder is a state crime (not defined in the Constitution), if you believe it is murder then you should believe it should be left to the states.It should not matter. Government should not be involved in our private lives at such a level.Banning guns is always a good idea for the people with the guns. Easier to control those without it.Some, not all, of the 1% got there thanks to government using those guns that they don't want you to have. Most of the most wealthy companies are banks, Bitcoin is the answer to that.
If a man rapes a 6 month old baby (or initiates force against someone) anyone is morally justified in self defense or making things right with the victim.An entity should not have moral authority just because they are "the government". I use http://www.bitronictech.net I pay in bitcoins, the rates are good and the service is the best I have ever had with a hosting company. When you have to pay for the bandwidth you use, and your competitors get paid for providing that bandwidth...how would people be able to jam their competitors bandwidth? I also usually see that there is no financial incentive in most of these projects. Once the few people working for free move on to other things, nobody replaces them, waiting for those people to come back. You can use your bitcoins while hodling them at http://www.bitpools.comYou keep your coins in your wallet and get to use them to participate in pools without them ever leaving your control. This is always the worst argument. Trying to take the extreme position that something will all happen over night without any transition.As if Bitcoin is causing mass chaos right now as it replaces existing currencies. So...any word on if/when the safecoin network will get rolling? Maybe safecoin is the answer to the bandwidth issue:The resources in question are storage, CPU, online time and bandwidth. I'm not sure how they deal with paying for bandwidth and online time but it might be a good way to reward each node.http://www.safecoin.io/ http://www.coindesk.com/western-union-open-bitcoin-regulated-currency/So basically...Western Union is whining because they have to follow regulations and want their competition, Bitcoin, regulated too.Guess what Western Union? You are old news.A Bitcoin ATM next to every Western Union in the world would make them obsolete. Most big companies have lobbyists that can push for laws. That is different from saying that companies can write laws. The great thing about BitPools is that if enough people pledge their money toward it (keeping their coins in their own cold storage) the solution will come to us.Then it's just a matter of voting with your bitcoins on the best solution. Ya, I was thinking something like routers on top of electric and telephone poles. That would be useful for the long distance requirements. For long distances if there was a way to get bitcoins for the traffic you would probably make more money if you allow access over long distances. Ahh, that would actually work. I've done some simulations on those. That and blimps which would probably be easier to keep in the sky. The company that spies on us for the government. The Internet is going from a fairly decentralized network to more centralized and more susceptible to control. With Bitcoin we can come up with a great way to use mesh networks to create an alternative network and have nodes funded with bitcoins.Something like a wireless node you can set it up and with the possible incentive of being paid in bitcoins when people access it.We need to work on a cheap wireless relay node, preferably something that can be solar powered that could become like mining where people will want to put up as many of these things as possible to get a return on their investment. It could be used with maidsafe, each node could be a bitcoin node, etc.I've set up a pool here for those interested in helping to work toward this here:http://www.bitpools.com/?Solar%20Wireless%20RelayAs time goes on I believe this will be necessary to keep Bitcoin going unhampered and will allow us to keep a step ahead of the control of the Internet. Can those banks write laws?They stated that they will only use government currencies in their banks. This does not make all other things illegal in Bolivia. Nobody should have the moral authority to kidnap someone at gunpoint and throw them in a cage. It has already affected the price by injecting uncertainty into the market. The very question of "how do you see this affecting the price" is affecting the price.Monday the price will jump or down for a moment. If it jumps down it will jump right back up. If it jumps up it will come down a little bit.After that the rising trend will continue until we hit $666 again. Then it is only perception since BOLIVIA DID NOT BAN BITCOIN Yes, same episode where none of them banned Bitcoin.
Or is it the love of bitcoin thats the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love Bitcoin is to know and love the fact that Bitcoin is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a millibit, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of Bitcoin and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of Bitcoin are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.Let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters: the man who damns Bitcoin has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.Run for your life from any man who tells you that Bitcoin is evil. That sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one anothertheir only substitute, if they abandon Bitcoin, is the muzzle of a gun.But Bitcoin demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their Bitcoin and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being richwill not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guiltand of his life, as he deserves.Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standardthe men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted Bitcointhe men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-lawmen who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victimsthen Bitcoin becomes its creators avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once theyve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the hacker. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the barometer of a societys virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsionwhen you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothingwhen you see that Bitcoin is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favorswhen you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws dont protect you against them, but protect them against youwhen you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrificeyou may know that your society is doomed. Bitcoin is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying Bitcoin, for Bitcoin is mens protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers deny Bitcoin and only allow a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Bitcoin has an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, Account overdrawn.'When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, Who is destroying the world?' You are.You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why its crumbling around you, while youre damning its life-bloodBitcoin. You look upon Bitcoin as the savages did with gold before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout mens history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the love of money being evil, which you repeat with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slavesslaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebodys mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepersas industrialists.To the glory of mankind, there was, for a brief time in history, a country of moneyand I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to early America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, mans mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human beingthe self-made manthe American industrialist.If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choosebecause it contains all the othersthe fact that they were the people who created the phrase to make money. No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantityto be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words to make money hold the essence of human morality.Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters continents. Now the looters credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the bitcoin and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide as, I think, he will.Until and unless you discover that Bitcoin is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When Bitcoin ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns....or bitcoins. Take your choicethere is no otherand your time is running out. To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of moneyand he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it. Let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil.

When a central bank's legal department recommends banning the use of bitcoins in the banks it is not splitting hairs to say that the country (Bolivia) did not ban bitcoin. In each of your examples:company -> government -> banIn no instance can:company -> banother than within their own company.We get it. Banks have a lot of money/influence/lobbyists, etc.But a bank cannot ban bitcoins. Unless a bank has the power to kidnap people and put them in a cage after a socially accepted show of "fairness" they do not have the power to make something illegal. Only governments have such power. Imagine you live in Mexico on the border of the US. You will likely keep your money in two currencies. You have pesos for things you spend money on in Mexico and dollars for things you would spend in the US.Instead of pesos and dollars you now have dollars and bitcoins. You may need some dollars for things you spend money on that you can't use bitcoins for. Everything else you should use bitcoins.Use gyft as much as you can. You get a 3% discount just for that simple thing. The fact that bitcoin gained an average of 1% per day last year is something else. Even if the value goes up "only" 10% this year you have gained 13% by using bitcoins for your daily spending when you can. McDonalds has as much authority to ban a Burger King product as a bank has to ban a competing currency. It was on its way. Stopped mainly by the 666 whale that felt it was funny to keep selling at $666 and stop the rally. Then it was dealt a blow by the Silk Road sale.But the price will go up. The rally was only going to take us from the bottom of the price band to the top. But it is still within the band riding along the bottom as it continues to rise. A rally was due because everyone was ready for one. But the fundamentals will push the price to the top of the band when the ETF is released. I apologize if you were in the original thread that was deleted. I deleted my post when the thread was moved to Games and Rounds and created a new one in the Service Announcements section. The mods deleted the original thread so I was not able to get any user names from that thread.The new thread I created is here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=654854.0 Fortunately for you the Bolivian government did not ban Bitcoin.A bank's legal department made a recommendation that the banks only use government currencies for their bank accounts. This is true. And Bolivia did not ban Bitcoin. The data would be empty because there are no countries that have banned Bitcoin. http://www.cityam.com/1403264481/bitcoin-banned-bolivian-central-bank-threat-national-currencyNot as sexy or shocking as "Bolivia Bans Bitcoins" but more accurate.The legal department of the bank only recommended that only fiat currencies should be used in their bank accounts and money transfers.No legal authority in Bolivia has done any damn thing about Bitcoin.The US banks do not currently use bitcoins in their bank accounts and money transfers. The US has not banned Bitcoin. WTF? 3 pages and nobody has pointed out the fact that the title of this thread is wrong?Bolivia did not ban bitcoins.The Bolivia central bank does not allow bitcoins to be used in their bank accounts.McDonalds does not allow the sale of Whoppers in their restaurants in the US. The United States bans Whoppers! REEDS jewelry already does this:http://www.coindesk.com/reeds-now-lets-jewelry-lovers-pay-with-bitcoin-in-store-online/ So, would 100 bitcoins be considered a Byte? Banks can certainly influence governments and get their candidates elected just like large corporations or unions or any other large economic force.But until a bank has the power of guns and can kidnap you and lock you in a cage in a socially acceptable manner, they cannot make things illegal. Only governments are allowed to do that.And since no government has passed a law saying that they will kidnap you and lock you in a cage if you use bitcoins then it has not been made illegal.Even the bank of Bolivia, as powerful as it may be, has not influenced their government to pass such a law. Hence, Bolivia (the country's government) has not banned bitcoins. Banks are not countries. Banks are not states.Bolivia did not ban bitcoins. Bolivia's banks did.Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, etc.  are not warning against using bitcoins. Their banks are.Saying that a country bans bitcoins when their main banks ban them is like saying that a country has banned Whoppers because McDonalds in that country has banned all Whopper sales in their restaurants.News alert, banks do not transfer bitcoins. Banks do not hold bitcoins in their accounts. Banning their use in their banks is meaningless.
People keep talking about this like Bolivia banned bitcoins.Misleading title is misleading. Visa and Mastercard have also banned sending bitcoins over their networks.McDonalds has banned all Whopper sales! No country has banned Bitcoin (title should be changed).Have banks gained such a foothold as to make people believe they have the power of guns, kidnapping and cages like governments? Bank bans bitcoin!Alert the media!And what is Bolivia's stance on Bitcoin? Redskins CoinNow that the US has lifted the trademark on the Redskins logo it can be used for anything. So the next alt coin will be the Redskins Coin. Nothing special about the coin but it's all about the logo and the name. Which is the most important thing when it comes to cryptocurrency...just look at doge. They have to call them "tax havens" because if you were to call it "a country with no taxes" liberals would claim that such a place cannot exist except in Somalia.What abort da roadsh!!?!???!!? You don't. Let them fail.Freedom rewards those that embrace it the most. Those trying to get a nibble of those rewards without embracing it will ultimately fail with the rest of their brethren. Yep...the mods tanked my promotion.  There is an optional e-mail address setting in your profile. I have not implemented password reset functionality but I have been considering having the option of signing a message using your provided Bitcoin address. The zero initial balance is to prove that you own the address.In order to use the website you need to then have at least 10 mBTC in that address.It is a way to verify that the Bitcoin address belongs to you so that you can pledge those bitcoins toward different projects. No, you need to set up a zero balance BitPools Bitcoin address. Then I will send you 10 mBTC so you can participate in the site. You need to set your BitPools Bitcoin address in order for me to send you bitcoins. Definitely would not have run this promo if I knew I would be stuck in the gambling section where people are looking to get free bitcoins to use on some gambling site.Lesson learned. It should be saying that you need 10 mBTC to participate. Correct. You are joining with others pledging bitcoins toward a common problem. You vote for the solution that you like the most. Like a reverse kickstarter. You start with a problem and pledge funds. Then vote on the solution.As opposed to kickstarter where someone proposes a solution and tries to find people that want to solve that particular problem. nvm  deleted the thread in Gambling How To RegisterTo create a user on BitPools you must first register. Go to http://www.bitpools.com and click on the Login/Register button on the left panel. This will display a window with a login and password field. Click the button on the bottom that says Register a new accountCreate Bitcoin AddressIn order to confirm that each user has enough bitcoins to pledge for the pools you must set a Bitcoin address that you own. BitPools will not store any of your bitcoins.In order to verify that you are the owner of the Bitcoin address you must create an empty address. This can be done several ways. One of the easiest ways is to create a new Blockchain.info wallet used soley for BitPools. (You can also create an address using vanitygen, on the Bitcoin Core client you can click File -> Receiving addresses -> New. For this example we will create a new wallet at https://blockchain.info/walletClick on the New Wallet button and enter the required information. Be sure to write down your pass phrase and save your Identifier and password. Once you log into your wallet you will see a zero balance wallet. Your Bitcoin address is toward the bottom below the QR code.Set Your Bitcoin AddressCopy your new Bitcoin Address and paste it into the Bitcoin address box on your BitPools profile.After you set your Bitcoin address click on the V button to save your address. This will display your current zero balance. Edit: I have to lock this thread down due to being cast off to the lower bowels of bitcointalk. BitPools allows many individuals to pool their money with others toward common goals. Once a solution is proposed, the pool members use the Bitcoin Blockchain to vote for the winning solution.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasYFor the first 100 bitcointalk users BitPools will be paying out 10 mBTC (the minimum required to participate) to each user that signs up at http://www.bitpools.comRegister, create a Bitcoin Address and save it in your user profile.Then come post a message in this thread with your BitPools username and your BitPools address will be filled with 10 mBTC (.01BTC).You can create a unique address in many ways, two easy solutions are:Create a blockchain.info wallet: (https://blockchain.info/wallet/new)Download and run VanityGen (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Vanitygen)(One per person, only accounts created before June 2014)Please allow 24 hours for your account to be filled.

Is anyone familiar with the ease of setting up a corporation in St Kitts? You can vote from whatever address you want.If I am asking for investors to build a library and ask 100 people for $10,000 each. Does it matter if one person takes $30,000 and sends it through money launderers, changes to a different currency, then buys gold with that currency and then sells it for 3 separate $10,000 lumps of cash and then gives that money to me to build the library? The outcome would be the same. It is all about whether or not the funding reaches a certain point or not. If you are willing to pay more than other people to have a project go forward, there is no stopping you. This is not an attack but your socialist/communist ideology would probably be better suited for a Dogecoin town.You get attacked because you are trying to take a libertarian Bitcoin currency and create a communist utopia. That does not work. A small sample of quotes from FinShaggy from the other Bitcoin town thread. (for the $2 million land purchase)tl;dr The Silk Road bust took an otherwise stable price and shook things up. This brought both attention and lack of price range.This freed the price to skyrocket since nobody knew what the price should be. With the influx of new attention and money apparently the price point was very high.This time the price has not been all that stable so I don't see this as triggering anything too huge. But I do believe the price point is an unknown. It will likely be a roller coaster until after the sale.Buy low, sell high.I have no idea what the low will be.I have no idea what the high will be. Wars last only a few months when limited money is used. When the government pumps out unlimited money wars go for years.Poverty and income inequality is produced when inflated currencies are first given to the haves who then pass the inflation onto the have nots. Lack of rules does not stifle innovation, waiting for governments to catch up to technology is what stifles innovation.Government corporations are a thing of the past. Welcome to the future. Ahh, ok...this is just the 29k bitcoins. I thought there were over 200k.I agree, with just 29k they will be bought up quickly. And hopefully we will have new rich people in bitcoin. Keynes was such a great guy. If only his theories were taught in our schools and his theories touted by economists and government agencies. I'm about as big of a bull as anyone but I can see this sale dropping the price by quite a bit in the short term.They're taking in minimum deposits of $200k selling in 3000 bitcoin blocks.As they get through the first few millionaires they will have a lot of bitcoins left. Those that only deposit the minimum might be able to get 3000 coins for $200k.That's less than $70 per coin. I'd sell $200k worth of bitcoin to get in on that deal.Of course, there's a risk that you pull $200k worth of bitcoins out and pay the taxes on it only to not be able to buy 3000 bitcoins at the auction. You've just fucked yourself. When my brother was a kid he saved up his money to buy a clock radio. Back then, as a kid, it took him a while to do it.He still had that radio when he left high school and went to college. He shared an apartment with a bunch of potheads.One day the cops raided the place and found drugs. They took my brother's clock radio. He didn't have any drugs in his room.He asked for it back but it never happened. There is an auction on the 27th of the Silk Road coins. There is an auction of the Silk Road coins on the 27th. You should put all of your money into Euros right now.With negative interest rates you will be able to enjoy some great inflation. Gold as a currency for thousands of years and then being usurped by an oppressive government is a great indication that the scarcity model does not work for money. There are like a billion dogcoins created per hour. Your 100,000 dogcoins were created in one second.Since it is an inflationary currency the best thing you can do with dogcoins is get rid of them as quickly as possible. The fact that you lost them means you do not have to hold them and watch them become worthless. If you have ever lost a penny you lost something with more value. I believe they are limiting it to hotels first and expanding depending on how that goes.Which is fine, http://www.cheapair.com is good for booking flights in bitcoin.Paying for hotels is very much needed, it would have saved me about $200 in exchange fees for my hotel stay on my last trip. I will definitely use this. Often. If there is no momentum going into the next phase there would be no way it would jump to $1800 two weeks later.I still see it rising that high...some stability at this price is good for fueling the rocket.
Yes, this will be even better. My goal with BitPools is to eventually have everything decentralized. But with a concept so new I believe some hand holding will be necessary early on. Mike Hearn is working on a decentralized version and I hope it does well and if possible I would like to interface with what he comes up with if possible. Just like I wish to eventually use BitMessage for all communications, but for the new user who has never used it, a simple centralized forum interface that they are used to is a good start. Competition is healthy.As is said time and again. Having an idea is great but the execution is key.Implement it and do it well.  Not true.The voting system in BitPools creates a list of vote addresses and distributes an address to each of the voters. The list of addresses is then encrypted and made publicly available for anyone to download.Everyone votes by sending bitcoins to their address, then when the vote is over the private encryption key is brought out of cold storage and made available for everyone.Anyone can then decrypt the list of addresses and verify on the blockchain that the results match the BitPools results.Waiting for verifications does not matter because as long as you get your vote in with a single verification (within seconds) before midnight then the vote is counted. This can be easily be checked on the blockchain.As for a 51% attack. That is why Bitcoin is the best for voting. It has the highest amount of computing power behind it, the alts aren't even close. As far as this idea goes...stay tuned...I did not create a tool for voting with bitcoin for nothing. What a sad world you must live in. Free yourself. I see the opposite. The blockchain will be used to not only decentralize our currency but also any sort of centralized power that would use the blockchain against us. There's no way to pump n dump, it's using bitcoins not an alt currency.There are so many things that can be done with bitcoin that people trying to come up with Bitcoin 2.0 or alts just have not tapped into the full potential that the blockchain provides.This is the most secure voting system in the world because it would require more computing power than all of the mining computers to tamper with the votes. Even an alt coin specifically designed for voting would not be as secure. I love the Caribbean. I've been to the east, west and south...they're all great. I pulled $10,000 out of my retirement account and put it into Bitcoin when MtGox re-opened at $17.Then I spent the summer watching as the price went down...down...downLost most of it getting short squeezed at $3.50Sold the rest at a loss at $12 just before the jump over $100. The site allows for votes as small as 1 Satoshi.Though without force, such votes tend to be meaningless...more like opinion polls.But voting with your money actually puts value to your vote that does not require centralized control. The vote panel shows a "Send To Address" basically saying send bitcoins to that address. I try to make things as simple for the user as possible. With such a complex idea it is not that easy. Someone is a big believer in the bible and the reference to 666. They are pushing their belief in Christianity through a Bitcoin price trying to link Bitcoin and Christianity.Some huge religious fanatic with a lot of bitcoins is really going out of their way to spread God's word. Excellent, so there is at least one travel agent that accepts bitcoins for cruises, that should make it easier for planning a Bitcoin cruise.Would anyone be interested in a going on a cruise? I have set up the service http://www.bitpools.com where people can pool their bitcoins to make purchases.As I have not delved into the world of Bitcoin mining I am not sure of how people go about pooling for mining equipment.I think it might be helpful though and I would like to add any features that would make it easier to facilitate hardware pools.Please check out the How To section to see a full start to finish guide to setting up a Pool and let me know if it is a good fit for mining hardware purchases.(note: there are no fees charged on the site so it would likely be similar to using this forum with a better interface) I do not. At least not for BitPools itself. People fulfilling the proposals may need to deal with their local laws.The site is not hosted in the US, I will be incorporating from a non-restrictive country and although I am a US citizen I do not live in the US.As for the current legality of it in the US. Because all transactions are in bitcoin the FinCen regulations do not apply (definitely checked on this with a lawyer early on) and each individual should follow their IRS rules. Yes. See: http://www.bitpools.comHere is a sample result of a successful vote: The BitPools Bitcoin pooling tool is now open for use.Do you have a large project or an idea for something that would require a lot of funding? Is it something that a lot of people would support?BitPools uses the unique features of Bitcoin to create two powerful features:1. Verification of funds. Using the Bitcoin blockchain users can submit their Bitcoin address to demonstrate that they have the funds necessary to participate in a particular project. To achieve this the user first provides a Bitcoin address with a zero balance. Then the user sends at least 10 mBTC to that address to verify that the address is under his/her control. 2. Voting with your bitcoins.Once a proposal comes up for a vote, each user is provided with a Bitcoin address to send their vote. BitPools also provides an encrypted file with a list of all Bitcoin addresses for that vote. Once the vote date has passed, the decryption key is provided and all of the votes are tallied. With the Bitcoin blockchain the votes can be verified. The votes have the security of the Bitcoin ledger, the transparency of anyone being able to verify the results and the anonymity of nobody knowing which address belongs to which user.Whether you are a retailer looking to do a group bulk purchase or a charity organization looking for funding or have a business idea that could use some partners or any number of things that will require multiple people pooling their money together, BitPools is ready for your ideas.If you have bitcoins sitting in a wallet somewhere not being used, you can participate without your coins ever leaving your possession. Get involved and maybe there will be something worthy of your bitcoins that you can vote for.Check us out at http://www.bitpools.comhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY Exactly, trust will come with experience and I plan on adding ways for users to add credibility to their profile (link to their bitcointalk account, Facebook, ID verification, credit check, etc). As well as an Ebay style rating system for both proposers and escrow services.I have been with Bitcoin since 2010 and have seen every different scam and hack there is. I take all of that into account.Though down the road I would not mind making money off of the website, I am rather well off financially already so the main goal of BitPools is to create a useful tool for Bitcoin users that government currency cannot accomplish. You are correct to look for the risk. It has been my goal to create as little need for trust of BitPools as possible with the end goal being a decentralized system (baby steps).You are correct that if you want to participate you must fund your BitPools account with bitcoins. However, there are two major game changers with BitPools. One is the voting and the other is how you fund your account. You have full control over the bitcoins in your account. Read the demonstration on How To page on the site. You provide a bitcoin address with your funds. This is to verify that you have the funds in the first place to even participate in the discussion. BitPools never touches your bitcoins until you vote.This is where the risk lies and you are trusting BitPools briefly on the vote date to transfer the funds (but to break this trust on one proposal and one vote would break the trust for the whole point of the site).But yes, there is risk in trusting the proposer to follow through with what is essentially a contract with the voters. To mitigate the risk the plan is for the option of using escrow and multisig transactions for implementation of the proposals. The plan for the most secure proposal transaction would be having the voters designate a person or group to have control over one part of a multisig transaction, the proposer would have control over another part and a third party escrow service would hold the third. If the transaction goes through without a hitch, then the voters accept it and move the money. If there is a dispute the escrow service determines the outcome. As there are many different types of proposals I imagine there would be a lot of specialist escrow services (real estate, construction, businesses, generic, etc.)As the site is young I have focused first on making things as simple as possible, the goal of first just getting people used to the concept on little projects. Proposers will need to prove to the voters that they are trustworthy and do what they can to demonstrate that there is little to no risk. And as time goes on I will continue to add functionality to help whittle that risk down to nothing. While it is certainly not robust enough for running a huge government, the fundamentals are there. I am starting small on purpose.However it is not set up for running government the way we know it today. BitPools would allow for the ability to run as the "government" of a Galts Gulch type of city where there is no centralized authority but people still want to pool their money for city projects and have sway over how their money is spent through proposals and votes.Similar to governments but with control over your money.
As most people are skipping over the comments believing what the media tells about Afghanis being illiterate terrorists, here is a picture of school girls using Bitcoin to get around cultural difficulties with women earning money: While it could certainly be done at bitpools, with some coordination from the pool users and people creating the proposals...there are websites already created specifically for betting.Though BitPools would be useful if there is a bet on some site or in Vegas or somewhere that had a large minimum bet, say $100,000. Ten people getting together with 12 bitcoins or so each could pool their money to submit the bet (maybe there are better odds for such a high wager?). If the bet wins, they each get their share of the winnings (coordinated by the user who creates the proposal). Voting can already be done at http://www.bitpools.comExample vote result: Here's an example of Bitcoin's unique properties being useful in Afghanistan:http://www.coindesk.com/how-bitcoin-helps-afghan-girls-achieve-financial-freedom/While our government complains about Bitcoin freeing people to do "bad things" like buy drugs, in Afghanistan it is freeing Afghan women to get paid for working (probably also considered "bad" by the government). Is anyone up for a group cruise? At bitcoin's current prices we could definitely get a cruise price under a bitcoin and if we can get at least around 16 people (8 staterooms) we can get a discount on a cruise, or if we get more people we can have a mini-conference while enjoying a great vacation.I set up a BitPool to coordinate this. Check out the How To link at http://www.bitpools.com to see how coordination works from start to finish.http://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20Cruise You can now pool your bitcoins with others for achieving big, exciting things.Here is a sample of a Pool of users coming together to plan a Bitcoin cruise http://www.bitpools.com :<--Snip-->VotingThe voting option panel for all users will have the options as well as a Send to Address for each option. This is where the users send their bitcoins to cast their vote.On the right are three buttons used to download files that are used to verify the vote. The Public Key File contains the public Key used to create the Encrypted Key. These two combined are used to encrypt the Vote File. The Vote File contains all Send to Addresses for the vote. This is created so that anyone can have the list of vote addresses after the vote has finished and verify that the results match the results on the Bitcoin Blockchain.Users can click on the new proposal from the Proposal tab which shows the Proposal is open for voting.Once the vote date has passed voting is finished and the user will be able to view proposals whose dates have passed.Clicking on the Past Proposal will show the proposal after the vote has finished. This will include the Private Key File which can be downloaded to decrypt the Encrypted Vote File that could be downloaded before the vote date. There is also the Decrypted Vote File used for verification. The past proposal might not be clickable immediately as the Private Key is stored offline in cold storage, manually moved to the server after the vote.View ResultsThere is also the option in the Voting panel of viewing the results. When you click on the View Results button you will get a new window with the vote results displayed.The Results window will show the Win Total or Min Percent along with the total of the votes. The chart in the top right panel will tell how close the vote was to passing or it will show that it has passed. The bottom panel gives a list of all Send to Addresses and the amounts sent to those addresses. These can all be verified on the Bitcoin Blockchain. You can confirm in the Decrypted Vote File that those are the same addresses in the file created before the vote date.In this example the proposal does not pass. The 8 users that voted would split the 16 mB Incentive (after mining fees are paid) and the funds from their votes will be returned to their BitPools address. With the Pool messages users can give their opinion on why they did or did not vote for the proposal. This makes it easier for future proposals to put together something more people would vote for.After getting some feedback from the users and studying the results of the first proposal, for this example, another proposal is created.After submitting another proposal and another round of voting the proposal is ready for viewing.This time the proposal passes and the original goal of the BitPools Pool is met.The Incentive will again be distributed to all users that voted after mining fees are paid.The total bitcoins will be sent to the proposer's BitPools address (multisig escrow services coming soon) and a new Pool is created consisting only of those who voted for the proposal giving the users a place to discuss the future of their successful proposal and oversee its execution.This form of voting allows for a solution decided by those willing to fund it. The vote is transparent, anyone can verify the results, and it is secured by a vast network of computers all over the world. 420 was the police code for busting someone for Marijuana possession. The stoners found out and went with it.The only reason it "keeps hitting 666" is because someone keeps building a wall when it hits that number so that it will stay that number as long as possible. You even notice it trying to go to 666.66 over and over.Someone with a lot of bitcoins has deemed it his sole purpose in life to sell at that number to make a statement. Like 420. The European central banks lend money to the banks who in turn lend that money to people and businesses. There is not enough demand for loans so the banks are sitting on a lot of money. Now with negative interest rates the banks have to pay for money that they hold so they will be encouraged to get rid of it. They will give out really cheap loans at close to 0% rates.Imagine if everyone in Europe took out a 0% loan on as much money as they could get. The market would be flooded with new money. The printing presses would be churning, prices go up because everyone has plenty of money to throw around, they'll just borrow more. The value of the currency falls encouraging more borrowing and spending as the printing presses pump out money at full steam.Digital wheelbarrows of money become the norm to pay for everyday goods. Including bitcoins. You cannot hold google in your hand either. Does its utility give it value? http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/ecb-announces-negative-interest-rates-bitcoin-price-rallies/2014/06/05The European Central Bank has cut interest rates on deposits to -.1% pretty much forcing banks to pay to have money in their accounts.Do you think the Federal Reserve will follow suit and is this the start of competing hyperinflation between nations as they destroy their currencies in an attempt to boost their economies?How good do you feel that your bitcoin currency does not charge just to hold it? Ok we get it guy...the price of Bitcoin goes to 666. So clever. You really showed 'em.   Can we get back to moving over $700 now? Maybe you can wow us with your 777 joke.Or we can all laugh at 1337 for minutes. Definitely, they are in the midst of a huge change, I am sure many new business owners are learning a lot of processes from the US like credit cards and other western things. May as well teach them bitcoin while they are learning anyway. Though my experience is limited to a military base. But we have a lot of shops run by locals selling local merchandise. As well as restaurants run by locals (Pizza Hut, Popeyes, Burger King, Subway and others...).They have fast cell phone service in the major cities.Though I would never travel outside the walls. I value my life too much.  No, there is an infinite amount that will be created. Billions and billions every year.So much forks.So much inflation. dogecoin will never go for $1 each. Over 10 trillion dogecoins are mined daily. The only thing to do with a dogecoin is give it away before it loses value...oh too late, someone just mined a few billion while you were thinking of how to get rid of it. Sorry. Some of us want to be able to live mainly on Bitcoin. Gyft helps a lot with that. When they convert to government money is of little concern to me, that's their own funeral. So are you now a Belieber?Forever? We need to push Walmart to start accepting Gyft again. Think about it just for a moment.Russia has a news organization that they do not show to their citizens, only to people in foreign countries.This news organization promotes something that could destabilize a foreign government currency if the people adopt it.Watch RT with the knowledge that this is what Russia wants foreigners to believe. But not their own citizens. lol...I may or may not have used government computers under my control to mine bitcoins. You can already shop at Target using bitcoins.http://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-card/target-giftcard/This can be done in every grocery store.The question is...do you want a grocery store to accept bitcoin so you can spend your bitcoins at the store...or do you just want a grocery store to accept bitcoin so the price will go up on your "investment"?
Welcome to Bitcoin, I suggest you read the white paper.https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfIf you do not see the value provided by Bitcoin, you are not paying attention. You need new friends. No they are not using much USD, the local currency is called Afghanis. When I go to the ATM here they only have Afghanis and the military encourages us to use the local currency for everything. Though on base the local nationals accept dollars as well. They also accept credit cards. That old song and dance has been tried for centuries, we Knowers often laugh about such excuses by people that think they are Readers at our summer retreat in the Galapagos. We tell the stories to the animals and plants and we just laugh and laugh without making a sound. I'm in Afghanistan right now. They have Etisalat and Roshan phone coverage. Etisalat is based in the UAE and has a pretty decent data rate. They have the same smart phones available as in the US. The one to target first would be a chain that accepts gift cards, even better a gift card that can be scanned from your cell phone.That way the first step can be made showing that people are willing to pay bitcoins at their store. Just using your card?Carrying your card in your wallet, needing to protect your wallet if you are on the beach, keeping your wallet in your front pocket when walking in areas with pickpockets, giving your wallet to someone who can get all of your information from your card.Yes, that is so easy.Having bitcoins on a locked phone that I already carry around, scanning a QR code...so difficult. If you are looking for any actual evidence you will not find any. But there is a large industry built around people creating wild theories about some things they don't understand. The nanny state in Oregon made it illegal to fill up your own gas tank at the gas station. I have the ability to not only tap into the Hive Mind but also tap into the Readers which allows me to see everything that they have thought as well, they call us Knowers. I am seeing that you are making up a lot of false facts trying to pass yourself off as someone you are not because you think that people cannot disprove your thoughts. But you are wrong. I have seen it. You should research what is called "Mork and Mindy".Mind blowing. I would buy some gold with my bitcoins but I am not willing to take the risk of getting some tungsten with a layer of gold on the outside.I would cash out into government money but why would I want to hold a currency that is on the hook for over $70 trillion in debt.So...even if I did not want to hold, there is nothing else worthy of holding in its place. Where you ever taught about this event in history when the government sent tanks in to break up a protest?When the soldiers in gas masks gassed the protesters:Did they teach you about Tiananmen Square in school but not the US response to the Bonus Army protest? I have a list of public and private keys with associated public addresses I need to send bitcoins to.To get this to work I do:bitcoind getbalance testaccountbitcoind importprivkey 5xyzabc.....bitcoind setaccount 1xyzabc... testaccountbitcoind getbalance testaccount(if balance is higher by 'amount')bitcoind sendfrom testaccount 1toaddress...

People are always begging the government to enslave their neighbors.The thing is, so are their neighbors. Another early adopter distributing his bitcoins to new users.Enjoy your fiat, sucker. "There are a lot of problems in this world, wouldn't it be great if we could voluntarily decide how to solve them?"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY It is obviously an older video since the DOW was showing around $11k. I believe it is now over $16k.The huge debt will destroy the US.Bitcoin user affected (with huge gains in USD value). Android is better in so many ways. Yes, like how it is already being done for Lyft.
All of these responses miss the most important response.You can already do this with bitcoins.http://www.gyft.com/buy-gift-card/lyft/Kasimir Hill talked about using this car service when she was doing her "living a week on bitcoin" piece. They are also a threat to Citi. Why would we want serious investment?Bitcoin is a currency...for spending.Remember? The first month doubling of $450 to $900:Half way though, the price has risen $225. $225 to go until June 20.Right on target. Actually that explanation you just gave is the first I have been able to understand mining. Previously I just read about hashing and solving blocks. I am naming my kid Justin Bieber so that he will be forever popular. Sell bitcoin so that you can buy something with fiat?I do not understand this concept. Groups that are against bitcoin:BanksGovernmentsProfessorsEconomists Umm, you can already pay for Lyft (similar to Uber) with bitcoins via Gyft.I pay my monthly hosting service with bitcoins. I am charged monthly, sent an e-mail reminding me. I missed the payment once, they e-mailed me telling me they would stop my service if I did not pay. I paid. Simple.I have one charge on my bank account that I have no idea how to get rid of. I've called and e-mailed the company and they put me through so much trouble. Looks like someone decided to cash out a large amount of bitcoins at once.  Alts tend to rise at the same time as Bitcoin.Litecoin was up to $50 during our last peak. You need to take into account the fact that the last two peaks were when the block reward was 25, the ones before were at 50. Still right on target.Almost half way through the month and almost half way through the first doubling. I am an individual with my own thoughts and ideals. Do not drag me down with your need to be part of something bigger than yourself. I am big enough on my own. The price moves between the upper and lower trend line. "Bubbles" are merely a move from the lower trend line to the upper. They tend to move quickly because enough people bought at the lower or good news, etc.When it reaches the upper trend line there is nowhere to go but down...so people try to cash out before everyone else. It bounces back and forth between the two. I believe this trend will end when the ETFs go public, then it will stabilize. It is psychological.People go outside and see the full moon and start to think...moon...round...like a coin...bitcoin...Bitcoin to da moon!! Shake and bake! CampBx in the US is decent.I used to use them until Dwolla dropped them. Math has been used for some pretty bad things throughout history.It should not be regulated.
I had an idea for a movie called "Finding Satoshi" about those in control hiring a secret agent type to find him, going through the usual action sequences ala Bourne, 007, etc...their basic plan is to find Satoshi so that they can expose him as a man with weaknesses (every human has something in their past that can be used against them) and thus bring down Bitcoin with the usual "You use that currency created by a racist/sexist/<enter defaming word here>?"Finally they find someone that they are pretty sure is Satoshi, they have him tied up, threatening to expose him. He gets a message out to someone high in the community. As they are blackmailing him or whatever the news comes on...someone prominent in the community "outs himself" as Satoshi saying "I am Satoshi".Turning to another channel is another prominent person also saying "I am Satoshi". Suddenly everyone across the community starts coming out as Satoshi...pictures of politicians are defaced with the meme "I am Satoshi", signs up all over,etc..In the end those in charge let the real Satoshi go and the action hero drives home, his kid wearing an "I am Satoshi" t-shirt... Welcome to Bitcoin.I suggest you learn about the protocol by reading the white paper. The minority group that I belong to is being fought daily in Washington.The smallest minority, otherwise known as the individual. I recall when bittorrent came out people wanted to destroy it because some pedophiles could use it for kiddie porn.And yet it continues on.It has created a framework for many technologies that promote freedom including Bitcoin.To have killed it back then just because of the few people that are already subject to laws using it would have been a big mistake. BitStamp has been verified to be just fine. They actually proactively subject themselves to third party audits.As for the good news not pushing bitcoin price up? We have had great news of ATMs going up all over the world and more and more businesses accepting bitcoin since January...but the MtGox and China news always overshadowed it. Now that everyone isn't worked up about those things the price will make up for it.Stability right now is good. Stability fuels the rocket. For all of those people that keep worrying about ASICs making Bitcoin more centralized I have repeatedly told them that because of this you will at some point be able to go into a Walmart or Best Buy and buy your miner for $50 and be able to easily plug it in and start making money.When any joe schmoe can go into Walmart and buy a miner that they just plug into their computer and give it an address to send their bitcoins, then there is no stopping the decentralization of it. Like going in and buying a Roku box to get better channels with little effort setting things up. 2009: Satoshi mines the first block. While I am not disagreeing with the sentiment of his video, it offers no evidence other than "I have friends in the highest places that told me so". With freedom comes freedoms we do not agree with.The moral high ground includes tolerance of other people's freedoms.You know something has created more freedom when the "bad" part of it is the fact that some people are now free to do "X" that you do not agree with. Considering Wilson was one of the worst presidents in US history, I wonder how many of his dictatorial policies she was involved in. Was she the one that passed alcohol prohibition? Wilson is the genius who allowed the military industrial complex to take hold of the US. Though if it weren't for him we wouldn't have Bitcoin. Considering he handed all of the US control of money to the Federal Reserve. Though, who knows, maybe we would have had Bitcoin a lot sooner. If you want to avoid taxes by not making money just buy high and sell low.  With larger ships and with airplanes, his plan of shipping all of the black people back to Africa would be easier in this day and age too. Lol...hell yes it would be different. Martial law, imprisoning dissenters, no trial by jury...With the technology of today he could kill a lot more than a few hundred thousand Americans in the name of "Unifying the country" aka, squashing individual and state rights. Wow...a lot of pro-socialists lately.Doesn't Dogecoin have its own forum? Just over $100 rise in the first week. We are right on target. Stability fuels the rocket. Nah, I have noticed an ebb and flow of the media. One week something will be great, then the next week it will all turn around, then it will be great again. Watch the election cycle sometimes, especially as it gets closer to the actual election date. Someone comes out saying something bad about one candidate...they attack that candidate for a few days, then the candidate gives his side and people side with him and start supporting him, etc...As the Bitcoin price goes up everyone starts talking about Bitcoin's greatness...but then comes the race to be the biggest rain on the parade so people start digging...then everyone gets tired of the crap stories and want good news again... Classic. very soon
They hate us for our freedoms. So the best way to stop that is to take away our freedoms. They are doing a very good job of it. When it comes down to it, we form opinions based upon the information we take in.The politicians have to raise money in order to pay to get their message in front of as many people as possible so that those people will form a positive opinion on that candidate.The fact that the vast majority does not do research on the candidates on their own leaves them the short amount of time to form their opinions on the candidates based upon things like TV commercials.It is those who are not willing to do the simplest of research from fairly unbiased sources that cause politicians to beg for money, promise favors and skew their principles just so that they can get the funding to put their message out in front of people.Fix that simple problem at its source and you will fix US politics. Just like Michelle Bachman tells us all in this clip that Iran is 1 year away from nuking us. Fortunately Fox News attacked Ron Paul just as he was gaining steam or we would have been nuked. Ron Paul's poll numbers were just starting to show that he was the frontrunner. This debate alone put us all back in our place on how we should fear Iran and elect Mitt Romney. Close call.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W10t7LiJq-o I have found that "some people say" are almost always wrong. They prefer to be called progressives now. Have you read "Atlas Shrugged"?It may change your viewpoint on trying to save everyone.Focus on your family and those you care about. For those that are digging their heals into a system based around failure...you have to let them go. They are bad for Bitcoin in the long run anyway (see the people calling for regulation now). I told my family about it back when it was $17/BTC. They thought it was interesting and my brother sent me a link to an article about how the government could make Bitcoin illegal. I did my due diligence. When in Afghanistan I told a few co-workers who had a lot of money to throw into some investments. One bought one from me for $99, the others I showed how to set up CoinBase as it rose over $200 (one co-worker bought at $200, saw it drop to $175 then climb back to $205 and hastily pulled out...before it rose to $1240).I don't usually tell people to buy, I have more buying to do. But if they're interested about Bitcoin as a currency I explain it to them. Someone writes a program that creates a public and private key for you, but is easily replicated. All they have to do is run their program to obtain your public key and they then have your private key.Or something to that affect. Like many US employees I am paid every other Friday.This month I get paid May 2, May 16 and May 30.3 paychecks I get paid 3 times this month. For others that had that happen, they have their monthly bills and then they get a whole paycheck next week above their usual monthly expenses. Great use for it? Buy some bitcoins The last time I had 3 paychecks in a month...November. Thanks for the info. I'll check it out. Is there another way to create addresses programatically?I am having a hell of a time trying to get vanitygen to work on RedHat. I just need to be able to produce addresses with private keys offline. The people who believed the bears who were saying it would go to $380?I am only nervous about the rise because it is going up so quickly. But we have all been waiting for this so the quick jump is understandable. I just bought a 10 bitcoin laptop so that I could read this thread from my yacht.After I post this message I will toss it into the water to see what kind of bubbles it makes. Oh, and I noticed it is down from almost $550...that is a good thing, it was rising far too quickly to be this early in the rise.We should be seeing just under 3% rise per day on average...less now and higher later.  Jumping 5-10% per day was too much. Most of the weak hands have already taken their ball and gone home. Most of them left within a month when they had bills to pay/Christmas presents that they gambled holding off for a few weeks to get rich. Perhaps a prototype would be the best route on a small scale. I agree. 1. Buy2. Hold3. Goto 1 I could see it being done in an upper class home association where the roads are paid for as part of the price of the homes built. With electricity supplied to the home owners. If you are not a cranky old man right now, you will be great at it when you reach that age.
I bought in 2011 at $17I sold it all in 2012 at $12Either way, this: Do the banks have soldiers or police with guns that prevent you from freedoms like governments?Banks are private organizations. They can no more ban Bitcoin than McDonalds can ban hamburgers. Sure they may make it so that you cannot use their service for such activities but any private organization can do so. The solution is to not use their business. My goal has always been to get 2100 BTC so I could have .01% of all bitcoins that will ever be.Not seeing that happening any time soon I started shooting for .01% of current bitcoins (just over 1200).I'm not close to that either. The only thing Alex Jones will do to the Bilderbergs is to scream at them through a megaphone, making all protesters in the area feel at ease as if something has been done. There is one huge problem with that.The government owns the roads.Government is where innovation goes to die. And what excuse would liberals have for taxes if roads were paid for through solar power? Someone did this a few years ago but he vowed to only pay for things in bitcoins. So it looks like Moriarty and a bunch of newbies are the only ones worried about this exchange opening.I would not be surprised if Moriarty is behind a competing website. Will you be keeping track of all of the Silk Road purchases you make along the way? TA used to not work for Bitcoin. I think it was because >90% of the traders were just amateurs riding the crazy roller coaster jumping on and off and such unreasonable points that there was no way to predict what they would do. And someone with $10,000 could move the price a dollar or so (when the price was under $10).Now with more big investors, they follow trends and react based on trend analysis. It is fairly self fulfilling.  Rand Paul obviously hates America and wants Iran to invade our shores.It is a good thing Ron Paul did not win or we would all be speaking Iranian right now.True story. Too many Italian characters in Nintendo. Need more French. Great solution for those Bitcoiners.Don't use it.</problem> Dogecoin creates over 100 billion new coins per day.The only thing you can do with a dogecoin is to give it away as fast as you can before it loses several thousand percent in value per minute. Bribe those that control the guns to wield the guns in your favor! Overstock.com is highly centralized too.So is CoinBase, BitStamp, BitPay, and just about any business that uses Bitcoin. who would take Cartman seriously? The lowest it went last time was 4 times where it started from. So even if it crashes, the lowest it would go is around $1800. Why would people on bitcointalk care about the structure of some private organization? I hear that group has their own forum. The numbers are based on the last two rallies. Last February it doubled 5 times, in October it doubled almost 4 times (it would have hit $1600 if it completed the final doubling but the price rose too quickly and it came tumbling down). Each time the first doubling took a month and the next doubling took half the time and on and on.I predict 3 doubles this time if the trend of less doubling continues. If it rises too quickly expect it to come down before $3600. A slower rise combined with good news like the ETF or something major could take it higher. It is difficult for some people to hear things the way they actually are. It is much better to think that people are following laws because they agree with them. Not because they are forced to do so under threat of being kidnapped and thrown in a cage.
That is the whole point of socialism...bringing back the days of kings. The Blaze....Glenn Beck's website.He revealed his hand too early...Glenn Beck talks up Bitcoin on his show while using his website to bash it.Alex Jones did the same exact thing. Who are these people? Funny how the price floor has leveled out and started rising just in time for July as so many have predicted. Ok, last time when it was at $200 I called a high of $1600 over the next 6 weeks (it only went to $1240). Here is the timeline this time:June 20: $900July 4: $1800July 11: $3600That next week it will top out near $4000.So it is written, let it be known. 1st rule, there are no rules just traditions2nd rule, see the first rule Train to the moon! It is morning in China...so probably something from there. Over $460...the upper line has been breached.I also notice the sells going out a long way has gone down by about a million dollars. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJqdfDAfouM Mao was able to kill millions using his super voice powers. Did he have a mouse in his pocket? The software they want is a way to organize people to pay for those lobbyists in a decentralized way that people can vote on how their money is spent. As much as I love to point out that Hitler rose to power thanks to socialists the truth is that he took advantage of the party much like our public officials do all the time.It is actually a pretty powerful combination, you get the "country first" patriotic nationalists that are all about their country in a "we're number one" type of mentality, and you combine it with the socialists who cater to the huge masses of poor people promising them free money and you have a pretty powerful combination.Imagine a party in the US of down home US patriots, "that's my flag, not a rag" "USA USA USA!" nationalists combined with the universal health care, tax the rich, safety net, union masses that want free handouts. They are easily swayed with sweet talk and promises and no amount of reason would dent their blinders. Anyone could get elected, even someone like Hitler with an ulterior motive. I believe there is a way that each party can produce their keys without central knowledge of all 3. That type of stuff is beyond my knowledge, that is why I have not yet tackled the multisig stuff. My end goal is to have it very decentralized, but as a baby steps type of thing I am centralizing some parts until I can decentralize it.The proposal process will require verification by my company, from just verifying simple things for simple proposals to full identification and background.Each proposal will include the proposer and any information they provide, after time they will be rated much like on ebay.My long term decentralization strategy will include multi-signature where I will have third party escrow services (currently BitPools will escrow) hold one of a 2:3, have the proposer hold another of the 2:3 and have the pool voters designate a user or users to hold the other part of the 2:3. Going further it will not just be a single escrow, but both proposer and voters choose an escrow service...if there is a dispute then both escrow services review the problem. If they cannot come to a solution then a random (higher) escrow escrow service will break the tie. This is sort of how private businesses hire arbitration services to handle disputes all the time. I sent the guy a message on reddit. I will not open the source though, but that does not make the voting any less transparent.I will be leaving Beta soon anyway, I had considered replacing many of the Bitcoin Foundation roles with this anyway. And much more.I don't go on Reddit much but an upvote would be good to get some discussion on this:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/25sf4f/100000_bounty_for_software_platform_that_can/chku16gSuch funding would help push me toward leaving my job and working full time on the website. Then again, Bitcoin over $800 will do the same. Done. See BitPoolshttp://www.bitpools.comhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasYEverything he asks for can be done by creating pools.  I already did this, I was going to create a pool that can help replace the functionality of the Bitcoin Foundation.http://www.bitpools.comhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY The only people who care about what Snowden is saying pretty much knew everything he revealed anyway.Everyone else either justified it in their minds or ignored it.I believe he destroyed his own life for nothing.
More jobs lost?!?thanks Obama There are a lot of National Socialists in the US. They just do not advertise it in this way.They just vote that way. 3some</thread> This is pretty insane, looks like nobody wants to rock the boat and go up or down on the price. Who will flinch in the next 4 days? Nah, I was just trying to find an extension of this chart: https://www.tradingview.com/v/7YEmxS3K/so I made one myself, I suck at charts, that was the first one I have done in the 4 years I've been following Bitcoin Mashed potato revolver. I am thinking OP is actually promoting the Circle online wallet, throwing in that "you get money if you sign up" line...well played Circle This. They are saying there is a huge turnaround from the elections. A very business friendly government was elected, their markets soared after the election.The Bitcoin exchanges in India need to get the ear of key people in power to open things up. If drawing lines on a chart does not make me an expert, I don't know what would. Expert analysis shows...big things coming soon... Having the right to choose things as opposed to being forced...crazy idea huh? (hint: otherwise known as freedom)Like those rich Mexicans that fight to get to the US to get a below minimum wage job? Here in Afghanistan many Pakistanis are shipped in to work getting paid around $5 per day. They come here and make those sacrifices for such high paying jobs. I have stopped working in the US because of what it has become and have so many more options with such a large world.But I do know that a higher minimum wage and other socialist programs will help speed up the end of the US economy and its eventual reboot. I will ride this out from across the pond, keeping my money in bitcoins and hopefully help to rebuild afterwards if people learn their lesson. Or just leave it as just the place I grew up. I have traveled in Australia where the minimum wage is around $17. Everything was very expensive and services that are common in other countries do not exist (most restaurants do not have waiters/waitresses, you do much of the work yourself, young people having a hard time getting jobs, most small businesses run by the owner's family, etc.) Medieval Europe did not have bitcoins and crowdfunding.Works well in Detroit:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqlVL26jrCA Free market works best in the labor force. Being free is the best way forward for exchanging your service for fair compensation. It is when outside forces pervert the relationship between employee and employer that the fairness is destroyed. A cheap security service to protect yourself from such crimes would be more efficient for people initiating force against you.If you decide not to choose you still have made a choice. This is a huge world. You can work anywhere, there are jobs all over. Who are these people with no choice?Go where the jobs are. Go where you can live on whatever wage is paid. I left the US several years ago, they are so business unfriendly. I would never start a business there.Elitists look at individuals and try to decide how they should live and condescendingly believe they know what is best for other people. Let people live their own lives, stop being so elitist and condescending. Why work for those employers? Vote with your feet.If you do not have that option, you obviously do not have skills that are of any value. People losing their jobs, automation and robots for as many jobs as possible, even more jobs going overseas.Welcome to McDonalds, may I take your order: Yes! Allow people to be free, freely exchanging services for compensation...a mutually agreed upon salary without the threat of a gun.And that is the main problem in the US...though most people do not understand what freedom really is. Government telling you what to do is not it. I think the system you are looking for is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs..."
So, only a mild form of this is a good idea? I keep seeing this word "obviously" as if the government being involved in every part of our lives is so natural. That is quite scary (the ease of giving up freedom). I actually support people working such short hours. It leaves those of us who work 70-80 hours a week with a huge advantage over everyone who only want to barely get through life. How would people die from the minimum wage being raised? They already have this ability in the US. I am surprised that the UK is more strict on taking money out of people's accounts by the government than the US.Perhaps people in the UK should revolt against such American ideas. Why 40 hours? Why not? What would be the worst that could happen? All women are the same.  Do you think the government should force employers at the point of a gun to pay a wage that the federal government comes up with and spur the robot and automation industry to replace jobs or send jobs overseas? I agree, a slow rise is fine...there is no huge news to support rapid adoption.Something like the Bitcoin ETF, ebay adoption or something else unknown will send the price up quickly. Bear trend has been punctured. It is leaking bull market. No idea.2008: Glenn Beck calls Ron Paul a terrorist, calls Paul's ideas kooky and fringe.2009: Glenn Beck wishes he had a time machine to go back and reexamine all of those issues "he apologized to libertarians everywhere for calling himself a libertarian in the past. He has long called himself a conservative with libertarian leanings, but he said he is now leaning so far libertarian that he is almost horizontal. He said, "I'm going through a change here.""2012: Glenn Beck compares Ron Paul to Osama Bin Laden2013: Glenn Beck apologizes to libertarians (again...)See the pattern? Election year: "Libertarians are evil"Year after election: "I'm a libertarian now, forgive me for last year" I doubt he even changes his mind. He just knows that he can get a large audience spewing nonsense about freedom.He just shows his true colors when something actually matters. People that will be easily swayed when Glenn has an epiphany when it counts and sides with the government about how Bitcoin is bad because <insert big government excuse here>.See: Glenn Beck says TARP bailout is necessary, Glenn Beck coddles libertarians then dedicates a show to calling Ron Paul a terrorist when Paul runs for president and is starting to gain steam in the polls, Glenn Beck supports the Tea Party then as the Texas Tea Party candidate for governor starts getting press for rising in the polls Glenn Beck has her on his show and uses radio hosting tricks (cut sound to her but not to audience) to imply that she's a "truther", calls her Hitler, etc.See also all of the Ron Paul supporters that argued that "Beck isn't perfect but he has a massive audience"... If he supported it he would accept bitcoin as an option on his shopping site: http://www.markdown.com complete 180 turn on bitcoin in 5...4...3....2... Not everyone is successful.I would rather not be part of that everyone. and? I tell you what. When you get your paycheck, send me the money. When you want to spend your fiat I will give you money as you spend it.If I convert it to bitcoins and gain value in the mean time, do not bother yourself with that. You can rest assured that you did not spend your money unwisely. The law requires that you provide your name, occupation, etc...just like with a regular donation.
The big government conservatives are ok with government handing out welfare for their causes. It is necessary to fight terrorists. Because...terrorists. The IRS will steal your money (more than just via taxes) if you deal mainly in cash.http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-f-will-the-heavy-hand-of-the-irs/2014/04/30/7a56ca9e-cfc5-11e3-a6b1-45c4dffb85a6_story.html The Bitcoin rich list has stopped working, but I did find this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321265.0(outdated)1.  BTC980,000*.

"Theymos" So you should exchange your fiat when you get your paycheck to Zimbabwe dollars, lose several percent in value each day. That way when you buy a laptop for 3 trillion Zimbabwe dollars, tomorrow that laptop costs 4 trillion Zimbabwe dollars you gain 1 trillion Zimbabwe dollars for buying the laptop a day early. That way spending Zimbabwe dollars is always a gain because it is inflationary...right?Or consider last year. On average the price went up by 1% per day. If you convert your $2000 paycheck to bitcoins on Friday and buy a laptop 5 days later the value of your bitcoins have gained 5% or $100 that you would not have gained if you had kept your money in fiat. Sure, every year will not be the same rise of 1% but a rise over time none the less.So...why would you -not- convert your fiat to bitcoins? Using the government to get special privileges is great fun for men and women. It should not be limited to just two people. Groups of people should have the same benefits of marriage rights, shared health care, tax breaks, etc...Why stop at just special privileges for just two? They should take all of the stolen money and work on solar power too and give it to the poor and give it to schools and give it to me, give it to you...etc...We should all just go steal money and spend it on some great things. Why wait for the government to do it? When I was in college a friend of mine worked in the computer labs. He used to steal RAM out of the machines leaving each machine with just enough to run. He would put the RAM in his computer or friends computers.A computer program running on 3 servers is hardly anything.I also used to run a MUD on the servers in the engineering building. I had it up for about 2 years before they found it.I recall no letter going out to everyone in the school when they found out. They just e-mailed me and told me to not use their equipment as a server. Why? And ban bitcoins used in Russia and Iran too!Great idea opening this ban door!Who else to blacklist...hmm, what race or religions? It is always fun to dream about how to spend other people's money. Bitcoin Worse, it looks like they spent money on actual letters to each student. People in Zimbabwe would beg to differ. More likely an easier way would be to create a mining pool that has an algorithm set to not collect transaction fees.Then those that want to cut down the fees would join that pool when mining, while taking a financial hit compared to other pools.I doubt it would be very popular. Interesting, thank you. Maybe when their government currencies fail and they have to use bitcoins.They will still complain though and say that government currencies were the reason for the good ol' days. That bitcoin ruined all of that. I was curious about this as well.Wars and currencies I am curious about, the civil war, the 100 years war.I know the confederacy had confederate dollars, did the union have fiat currency not backed by gold? It would be a short term solution. A bunch of people get together to fund a large mining platform that would cost a lot of money. They would also have to pay for the electricity.In theory they could make their money back through the rewards but if not then you have to take a loss. And after your mining platform becomes obsolete you have to donate more. Basically funding the Bitcoin network. Or they are literally talking about some big things.What can you buy online that is big?
Just curious what others think the price will be at the end of the week.Barring any more attacks by banks or governments I think it will slowly rise to move above $500. BANKS AND GOVERNMENTS DO NOT LIKE BITCOINNews at 11. Huobi is a Chinese exchange.China banned bitcoins months ago. I predict Dell will accept bitcoins online. Her menstrual blood will attract bears.Did you hear that? Bears. Brutal. It is quite common for those that call for peace to be attacked. In Saudi Arabia they throw you in jail, in the US they use the government media to attack you as a terrorist/traitor. There are a lot of people that see others as a collective as opposed to individuals. All it does is reveals their ignorance and mental laziness.A child should not fear others because of the child's lack of knowledge and understanding. You should not need to attack the weak...they will destroy themselves without your help. Yes, people can track your IP to a bitcoin transaction if you do not mask it. The recent DoD news about looking into Bitcoin did not say that Bitcoin was a threat.It was a call to action to investigate whether or not Bitcoin is a threat used by terrorists or not. We were in a rut...the price was stagnant for months.Then Silk Road was busted. The market crashed, then rebounded to the same price within a day.We were pleasantly surprised that even without Silk Road, the price was the same. It started the price moving up slightly as there were many media articles about the bust, the articles tended to mention the price rise.That got the ball rolling, then China came into the picture.This bull run will be because China is out and we see that the price did not crash the price.The ETF potential and some other unknown factors will push it back up (there is a lot of upward pressure at the current price). People you do not agree with should be scared of expressing themselves?Perhaps they should fear the gas chamber. About 10 minutes of their time on BitPay. I am disappointed after reading that page. I will now try to avoid anything related to dogecoin and that meme in the way that I avoid the video about 2 girls and 1 cup which I have never seen but know enough to avoid. I think China has heard about dogecoin but feels so sorry for anyone who holds them that they just cannot bring themselves to say that they will ban it.There are like 100 billion dogecoins created a day with about 500,000% inflation per year built in.There is a reason that the best thing to do with dogecoins is to give them away. Looks like the UK is trying to be like the US. It would benefit a move to maidsafe in a way that the TARP bailouts benefited Bitcoin. I am ok with the way this is playing out. A private company creates a game. A group online say they want them to change it. The private company says they do not want to. The online group can now either protest it, not buy from that company, work with the company toward combined future interests...whichever.Fortunately the government was not brought in to use the force of a gun to make the decision.We, as Bitcoin users, could see a new video game using their own online currency and get together to ask them to use bitcoins instead. It would be their decision. If we had enough support and felt it important enough we could get together to create our own game with bitcoin included or lobby companies to do so with the knowledge that their sales will benefit from it.  I still don't get the doge meme joke...there are so many pictures of dogs and cats on the Internet...what makes this dog funny? These are Bitcoin backed securities. Which means that the stocks sold will have to provably be backed by actual bitcoins.So those bitcoins (200,000) will be held to back the securities.This will bring in investors that can only deal with Wall Street funds. Big businesses and funds that would never buy bitcoins in a way that one person with the password or private key can steal all of the company's bitcoins.This really does nothing for Bitcoin itself other than drive up the price. I played Fable III and I could have done without the large amount of homosexual references in it.It's fine if it's in there or if your character is gay but almost every other character is gay. It detracted from the game. I was there to play not be taught some life lesson in equality or whatever statement they were trying to make.
"a fan launched a social media campaign last month pleading with the gaming company for equality, but Nintendo insists their creative choice wasn't designed to offend."http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/nintendo-game-faces-criticism-over-lack-of-gay-characters-20140507 So Russia....to da moon? The future of education will all be online.Sure kids might go some place with teachers assistants or a type of "babysitter" for a few hours to work on their online assignments, but it will still all be done online.Florida already offers a full, free curriculum online where you can get full credit including a high school diploma.The teacher's union is unionizing teachers right out of a job. Higher education in the US allows people to choose their college. This is good but what sucks is that they cannot use the bitcoins to pay for campaign spending. So the huge campaign industry will have no need to accept bitcoins.The politicians must first exchange the bitcoins to dollars in order to spend it. The United States used to be referred to as "these united states". finally! True story. It is all about supply and demand.He mentions that 98% of kindergarteners have this great creative instinct.So...if there is a demand for such a thing...you have a supply consisting of billions of people that can think at least at the level of a kindergartener.That is wonderful, supply covered.Now, what if you want someone with the knowledge to transfer electrons over a large distance at a certain frequency converting it to useful information...then you may need to spend some time to figure out how such things work and might require a background that allows you to understand each of the pieces that go together to get that knowledge. Or more importantly, to come up with new ways of doing such things, better.Is there a large supply of such people? Is there a large demand for cell phone technology?But you have a choice, you can be someone that is in plentiful supply with little demand or you can be someone in high demand with limited supply. The result tends to be that you will not have much power (money) if you are part of a huge supply with little demand, while someone that is in huge demand with limited supply will have more power (money).It tends to be human nature to want more power, not less.If you want to not learn about things that are in demand...go for it, find yourself. Offer to the world that which billions of other people can offer and find out quickly how well that works out for you. You can artistically put a Subway sub together (until someone else comes along that will do it cheaper).  worst...timing...ever Download the Bitcoin client (bitcoin core).Go to file, receive, generate address (or something like that...I don't have it open right now)Or download vanitygen, run it. Wait...China is banning Bitcoin!?!?!ZOMG!! SELL SELL SELL!!! STOP THESE STUPID THREADS! I used to think that FUD stood for F*#$ed Up Disinformation. It still fit.And yes, soon after May 10 a new article will state something to make most people believe that China has once again banned Bitcoin.When in reality, the companies that compete with Bitcoin have been working to stop their competition (Bitcoin) from using their services.Sort of like Burger King stating that they will not accept McDonalds' coupons which is then reported as "Fast food bans the use of coupons".Or, if only Burger Kings in the US banned the coupons the articles would say "US fast food banning coupons" and "What does the US fast food ban mean to you?" I am about as pro-market as anyone, and I am just floating this idea as a stabilizer to deal with the pre-IPO/small market we currently have which is why the price jumps all over.Why $1,000. Because it was an example using an easy number.You all seem to miss the part where I said the price moves with the market. As people start buying up the higher wall, the lower wall moves up...so $1001, $1002, etc...as the buy wall gets bought up the price moves back down $1002, $1001, $1000, $999...etc.What we have right now is market manipulation by people who build walls solely for the purpose of affecting the price, not from a supply/demand stand point but a panic/fear standpoint. How is that better than if that same person created a huge wall on each side did it for the purposes of stability? It would still be as free of a market as we have right now.It probably would have been more necessary when the price would go from $7 to $3 then up to $5 in a few hours when Bitcoinica was manipulating the market to kill people's long and short positions. That was the free market too, just being manipulated for someone's own gain.I would rather not have the market manipulated and have such high volume that the movement of 1% in a day would be significant. But we are not there yet and still at the whims in the short term by people with enough money to manipulate the market.Why not work toward stopping the manipulation that causes volatility and fight fire with fire to manipulate toward stability? While I do not like taxes, pay per use is a better option. Unfortunately the government charging for use is a monopoly which never works out.The benefit I can see from this move is that they set up the infrastructure that could then be used by private companies to buy the roads and charge per mile. But I would not think the transition would go very smoothly. Such trust could be transparently tracked, even anonymous.People pledge toward a floor price. Each is given a random fraction of a dollar price to set their buy price (ie $100.1032). Everyone can see that the buy price is filled on the exchange and can collectively say "1000 people pledge $1,000 toward keeping the bitcoin price above $100 for a total of $1,000,000 backing a $100 floor".This would create confidence that the Bitcoin price will not crash below $100. But only as much confidence shown by those that have put in their bids. If someone pulls their bid, it is shown as less confidence, if people add to it it shows more confidence.This would also be a way to do as many Austrians call for and peg the price floor to gold. But that would be more difficult as people would need software for their own bids to follow the gold price. Bitcoin acceptance requires ease of fiat to bitcoin and uses for the bitcoin.The ATMs help with the first part. Bitcoin accepting websites and places like gyft help with the second part. If it goes below $400 it will be quick and brief and if you have bids in place it will only hit them if they are small.
I agree, I have bought all in but about $10k I set aside for somewhere under $420...was hoping for some panic but think we will see bottom in the next week. BTC->USD->EUR->AED->EUR->USD->BTC is way more expensive.Damned Bitcoin and its high fees. That's a lot of porn storage. He got some feedback from the crypto forums before the white paper.People so want to believe that it was a community because in this day and age individual accomplishment is evil. Interesting video of a couple who came up with a prototype for a smart road that lights up, detects pedestrians/animals crossing to create warnings to drivers, can heat the road to take care of snow/ice, produces its own electricity, can be used to pass network traffic, pass road water to be cleaned, etc.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNMFKKyFU60Why don't we have this technology being used for our roads today? You would think that some of the road company owners would want to invest and try this technol...oh wait...that's right...government roads. One idea I had was a group of people that wished to stabilize the price to get together and like your idea of promising to put in $1000 to the buy wall, each person would get a price and amount such as $1000.0408 and when that price is sold they get another number (automatically created via software). Each person can verify that they are still part of the group as all of the bids and asks are shown on the exchange.The reason for having a large wall on the largest exchange would mean that the arbitragers are working for you instead of the need to put it on each exchange.But outside of some desire or loyalty to keep the price stable, if there is a financial incentive then many people will sign up and it will organically balance out.As for the idea that this is price fixing or market manipulation...it would still allow for the gradual movement of the price. If great news occurs and there is upward pressure then the price will gradually rise. Same for falling gradually. What it would help with is someone going to buy groceries with bitcoin when the price is at $450 then you get home and the price is $500.The stability will come with a larger user base and more liquidity, but this could stabilize it in the mean time. His answers seemed to indicate that he is a Keynesian who does not understand the concept of not printing limitless money.This is great for video game companies that want to print as much money as they want and benefit from it.I recall when I first found out about Second Life a Linden dollar was equal to about fifty cents (or 2 Linden dollars to 1 USD)...how much are they worth now with the ability to print as many as they want? Ahh good. As long as it is in the works. It just seemed like an obvious thing to create.I had thought that a good way to make money on it would be for people to sell their promo codes (usually you get free codes every few weeks) in exchange for bitcoins, like 50 cents each, then use those codes on the use dates. I agree, if Coinbase comes out with one I would go with it.They are the only online wallet I have bitcoins on (only because I have not gotten around to transferring them to cold storage). I feel fairly secure with them there. Wait until everyone starts panicking about some stupid nonsense.That is a great time to buy. The World Cup... The Republicans had control of the House, Senate and presidency for several years under Bush. Which year did they not run a deficit?Reagan ran up huge debts, the Bush wars added a lot more debt. For a brief moment, using some unscrupulous accounting techniques there was a surplus under Clinton, that quickly went away.The US is united under the fact that we have a $20 trillion debt that continues to grow with hundreds of billions of dollars paid toward just the interest on that debt. We will soon owe more in interest than we can even bring in from taxes. We will be united in our own economic destruction. Holding government currency ensures that you lose purchasing power over the long run.Converting immediately to bitcoins is best, and holding your money in bitcoin as long as possible is even better.The fact that this Mastercard converts to government currency only at the point of sale means that you can hold your money in bitcoins for the longest possible time, just as long as making a purchase using bitcoins. Would you like to pay for your RedBox rental with bitcoins? Basically pull up a RedBox Bitcoin app or webpage after you choose your DVD, put in the number of movies you are purchasing then pay with bitcoins. It would then give you a promo code to enter to purchase the movies at the kiosk. I do not see it taking any longer than it takes for the movies to get spit out of the kiosk.I was checking out RedBox and see that you can buy promo codes on their website.It would not be that difficult to set up a server to accept bitcoin for the payment and display a promo code. Buying now is like buying last year around $100. The AP decided to use 'b' for all references to Bitcoin.They are idiots. These DoD call to actions are common. What it basically does is says that the DoD is willing to fund contractors that will give them information on the topic they are asking about.Usually someone with an inside connection to the reviewing agency will put together a contract with all of the wording that the agency is looking for.Then the key is to know what the agency wants the results to look like. Then you do some pseudo scientific research and analysis and come up with the answer they want. You put it together in some big briefing or product with the idea that you need more funding to move to the next phase (for bitcoin the next phase would be a program to monitor and help fight the terrorists using bitcoin) which brings in the big money.The person who used to be in charge of the whole thing (some Colonel or General) eventually retires and gets hired by the same company that he funded for the big project and makes bank sitting on his ass getting more contracts using his inside connections. And the cycle continues. Dogecoin is great for giveaways because that is what you do with Dogecoin...give it away.If I had a currency that inflated faster than the Zimbabwe dollar I would be throwing it away on tips and whatever the hell else I could unload it on quickly.This is a perfect application of BitPools...a bunch of people that want to support Bitcoin by sponsoring something but do not know what to sponsor.If enough people pledge their bitcoins toward something then we can have a good idea of what we can accomplish. Otherwise it is just daydreaming.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY Bitfinex ties directly into bitstamp.Bitfinex usually tends to have a much higher long position than short. This would push the price up a bit. Historically Bitcoin has been a better store of value than government currency. Over time that means that immediately converting your paycheck to bitcoins and spending as you currently do will make you better off in the long run. Until Bitcoin is accepted everywhere, this means that you still have to keep government money in the bank to buy things.Keeping your money in the bank sucks, they literally own your money once you make a deposit. It is just as safe as putting your bitcoins on a third party server. You wouldn't do it with your bitcoins so why do it with your government money.As things get worse, the first two points become much more apparent. Hyperinflation and things like Cyprus have no affect on the bitcoin user (other than less buying power per paycheck).
What date do those lines meet? I ordered her flowers from http://www.cheapflowers.com/paid in bitcoin We have just surpassed 1000 kConventions...we need a new name for this since it is growing so quickly. $5,000 by December     /\_/ Right now there are about 10,000 threads and ideas about changing the naming convention of bitcoins.I think that people will not like talking of this many threads in terms of 10,000...maybe we could use kConventions when talking about naming conventions?Like this: "I just logged into bitcointalk and read 10 kConvention threads".This is based upon absolutely zero market research or experience like all 100 kConvention threads I have read about this, but like every other idea it came out of nowhere and all it required was a simple post of a new thread.We can use the symbol +|+ and pronounce a single kConvention as "kukukaroo".Great idea? I know this furthers Bitcoin's adoption in no way whatsoever and is meaningless and likely covered a thousand times before but if every bitcoin user does not come up with a naming convention then they just aren't trying hard enough. I have been lobbying for McDonalds to change their golden arches to a Z for years.For some reason they do not want to do that.Why wouldn't McDonalds want a cool Z logo? All united behind the idea of bigger government and more debt. The laws are written by the people who get the money from bribes. Interesting...the Republican and Democrat parties would do all that they could to get as many people in their party to sign up for this lottery so that whomever is elected would vote for their agenda. Then they would mold them into their fold as soon as they are elected with promises of goodies to come after they leave office.But you would more likely have a few people that would get through with their own ideas, but they would be minimal. Like now. 5 years of thousands of articles and millions of people hearing about Bitcoin...and now people want to create some new brand name because...umm...they had a thought? I had this idea a while ago but was not sure if the incentive would be enough or whether people not using the software would have an advantage.Basically I was thinking of a piece of distributed software with an API to the largest exchange (ie BitStamp).The goal would be to have a huge buy and sell wall such that the price would not have huge swings during the day but a gradual move up or down. So you might have a $2,000,000 buy wall at $499.50 and a 4,000 bitcoin sell wall at $500.So essentially, anyone buying or selling would buy or sell within that small window.Say the sell wall starts going down because of more demand and goes down to 3,500...the price might gradually move up a penny at a time to $500.50...moving up gradually until the equilibrium is once again obtained.The spread would be just outside of the range of the lowest exchange percentage. The advantage to the users of the software would be high volume at that rate in order to get a constant return with low risk. The advantage to bitcoin users would be a more gradual movement of the bitcoin price while still allowing the market to move the price over time.The mechanics behind it would be that each user would be given a number to buy and sell at just outside of the fixed spread.So user A might be given a price to buy at $499.48 and sell price at $500.01 and user B might be given the price to buy at $499.49 and a sell price at $500.02.The software will only work for you if you set an equal amount at each price. But as people buy or sell, they will hit your prices and you will gradually make money. The main problem I can see is people putting in their bids right above or below the price spread, though over a large volume such small bids would be minimal.Is such a thing feasible? The states are too united in my opinion.The dictator Lincoln turned our country from a collection of distinct states to a single country with superficial differences between the states.Any differences between the states are merely "allowed" by the Federal government if they have no real impact. Did you mean for it to say Black Hat Geek? The longer we go with these low prices, the more weak hands that bought in at $800+ will sell.That way the next run up we will not have so many "Finally we are back to where I bought in, time to sell". lol...Trolls gonna trollYou know how I know you're a troll.The need to attack everyone who calls you a troll.You should just put on an auto-reply of "Ya huh..." Or we are buying like crazy on every panic sale  Based on the trend I said that we would probably be at $2,400 by now.That was before China was a factor at all.I think we will touch that number by the end of summer. I noticed you cannot yet search by companies that pay with bitcoin.If they add that, it will help a lot when going to a new town. Though you can currently use coinmap and other services. Regulators gonna regulate.The key is for the technology to always keep one step ahead of the slower process of regulation. They could do that...they still have to produce the 1000 bitcoin video game. (that would be like paying your boss $45,000 so that he hires you for a $50,000 job)And if the proposal includes that they will use escrow, then they do not get that money until the work is complete (or at different stages of development).
to da moon!!! hmm...payday tomorrow...someone wants some cheap coins That is where you are mistaken. If a vote passes, it is the votes themselves that fund the proposal. They are not returned unless the vote fails.Imagine your scenario where the problem is that a bunch of people want a video game that uses bitcoins as the in-game currency.Video game company (Blizzard) bribes user Joe to propose a solution using Blizzard software.Joe proposes a solution, Blizzard software will create a video game with all pledgers getting free access to the video game and a share of the profits.For the goal of the proposal they need $450,000 (1000 BTC) for the proposal to pass. They set a minimum vote to 1 bitcoin.Joe creates 900 accounts and votes 900 times at 1 bitcoin each vote.100 other people like the idea and vote with 1 bitcoin as well.The proposal passes, Blizzard gets the contract and sets about creating the video game.Joe just spent 900 bitcoins and will get 90% of all profits delegated to the voters. All other voters will get .1% plus free access to the game.Or Joe could have just paid Blizzard 1000 bitcoins to create the software in the first place without the need to pool his funds with other Bitcoin users.When we talk about vote fees returned, if Joe were to create 100 accounts voting 100 times with 100 bitcoins and there are only 100 other people voting 1 bitcoin each, then the vote total is 200 bitcoins with a needed 1000 bitcoins for the proposal to pass. All users would get their bitcoins returned.And with BitPools, the vote amount is a "minimum amount", so Joe could just use a single account to send 100 bitcoins to have the same affect. It would just be on the proposer to properly deal with differing amounts per vote. Preaching to the choir my friend. With BitPools you vote with your bitcoins. If someone creates a proposal and someone else creates millions of bitcoin addresses and fills each address with the minimum vote amount (ie. 10 mBTC) and sends their bitcoins...what would they gain?It is built to scale quite a bit. I believe many things can be done using the bitcoin blockchain without the need for sidechains. There is a lot that to it that nobody has implemented. It is sort of like kickstarter but in reverse.On kickstarter someone with an idea posts the proposal and tries to get people to fund his project.On BitPools people with a problem pledge their bitcoins toward that problem, then people with ideas and the ability to provide the solution posts the proposal.Then people vote on whichever idea they like the most.There is also the implementation of Dominant Assurance Contracts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assurance_contract) where an incentive is given to the voters, if the vote fails then those that voted for the proposal will split the incentive. This encourages people to vote if they support the proposal even if they believe the proposal might fail. The article I read was about a Silk Road vendor from the UK that was busted and his bitcoins were sold.Not the huge FBI seized coins. So, the Chinese banks are afraid of Bitcoin. So they are banning all transactions between banks and bitcoin exchanges.But what if exchanges started accepting products for money, like a huge list of everyday items that people would otherwise buy. They set up a "store" with all of these items, you buy 1000 CNY worth of goods. Then turn around and "sell" those goods to an exchange for 1000 CNY.The exchange is not even touching the banks. Any products they buy are put back for "sale" on the website. No inventory required unless they want to give people the option of having a product delivered, then just mark up the prices and make money from that business as well.Chinese banks can't ban the purchase of every day products. And they cannot ban people from selling things online. Bottom left, uses the Bitcoin Network and the Bitcoin Currency.That is the great thing about BitPools, it uses the most secure ledger in the world to store the votes which are both transparent and anonymous.No changes to the Bitcoin core needed, from the ground up everything is built around the advantages of the blockchain technology. My sister is a Chiropractor in Carmel Indiana. She accepts Bitcoin.http://www.drnancye.com/ When there is a proposal, the person creating the proposal sets the minimum vote amount (ie 100 mBTC) and either a goal amount (ie 1000 mBTC) or a percentage of pool members (ie 50%).If you wanted, you could certainly vote several times (and I plan on making that simpler than creating separate accounts) but all you are doing is spending more money. But this could be desirable if you were voting on creating a new company and you wanted more "shares" of the company (ie Creating a Bitcoin Video game company, etc). Signing  up is very easy, I value the ability to be anonymous so no e-mail is required. Just a username and password. Ya, there have been a lot of projects that would have benefited a lot from this...anyone that wants a project with a lot of people funding a single goal.At least now it will be available. BitPools allows you to vote with your bitcoins. Instead of an entity that would take your money and then allow you to vote for the person that gets to spend it. BitPools is more about empowering people instead of giving power to another entity through a majority vote.I can see the need for polling station finally becoming legacy items. BitPools (http://www.bitpools.com) is a way to pool your bitcoins with other people to solve a problem, using the Bitcoin blockchain to vote on a solution.Let me know what you think. It must be hard after all the time you put into getting Bitcoin's use more widespread. You should buy more coins. Now. Did you pre-order or enter your e-mail to be informed when the pre-orders begin?
qft No idea about the US law stuff but I use http://www.bitronictech.netReasonable rates and good service.They have VPS locations in US and Denmark. Welcome to the forums.The point is to move your money to bitcoins instead of holding inflating government fiat.Until bitcoins are accepted everywhere you either have to cash out bitcoins to government fiat then transfer it to something to spend the money or keep some government fiat or whichever.With Xapo you will be able to convert every paycheck immediately to bitcoins. Then just use your one card to pay for things that you cannot pay with bitcoins. BitPlastic costs 5% to convert your bitcoins to cash to put on the card and it's not instantaneous meaning you have to pre-load it.With Xapo it converts right when you make a purchase so you can keep your money in bitcoin right up until you make a purchase and not have to worry about loading it with cash.The key will be how much, if anything, they charge to use the card. Ban #46 by Chinese banks. Just got my IRS refund yesterday...wanted to put it all into bitcoins but prefer to buy when people are panicking.Perfect timing...added many more BTC to my wallet. They are backed by millions in VC money. They are here to stay.I would trust them with enough BTC for a week or so of spending money. Even better. So by checking https://masterchest.info I have transactions with SPT sent to:MSAFE-Testand 10 SPT sent to AdamsCoinAre those the maidsafe blockchains?Quite confusing. May 10 is the final final final final final final ban...honest. Sell in May to come back in June to buy at a higher price. This is the super serious non-secret we're serious this time ban from the chinese banks.Last one...honest.Until the next one. I believe this company has got it right when it comes to a Bitcoin to debit card business:http://www.coindesk.com/xapo-launches-bitcoin-debit-card-accepted-at-all-mastercard-locations/This is the Bitcoin MasterCard we were all drooling over a few years ago but never came to be.You store your bitcoins in the Xapo wallet either in cold storage or a hot wallet. You swipe your card at any place that takes MasterCard just as you would do with any other card and they check to see if you have enough bitcoins in your hot wallet to cover the price. If you do, the coins are automatically exchanged for the cost of your purchase.I think that right now the biggest question is the cost. If it is just their 1.2% yearly fee of holding your bitcoins in their vault, then this is a huge step forward. Especially if they can get your bitcoins to you in whatever currency of the country you are in. As someone who has traveled to several countries, the costs of converting to local currency suck big time. If people are able to use this card and travel the world, they would be ahead of all other credit card companies.This could cause a huge swell in adoption.  Banks...not government. This already exists. You can pay 2% to have your bitcoins in a Bitcoin vault. We definitely need to wait for the Chinese to get back into the game so they aren't left behind for the world's new currency.It's only fair. Humans don't own land. They rent it from their governments. It is: 1KHfLixa2idRnZXMUfEisBati1vpywaH6EVerify on the website before sending. They use Bitcoin. If I am not having a mild heart attack every day then Bitcoin has failed.
Shenanigans call confirmed.  They will make a similar movie about Putin in 50 years. And it will be equally good for insomnia. Ok, thanks for the clarification. The information says they are selling 10% of the safecoins. But is that current safecoins or is there a hard cap?I like the idea and the project and would likely create some software for this but if safecoin has no hard cap and is inflationary then it is like dollars and should only be used when needed but not held. Let alone, purchased as an investment. Imagine buying Zimbabwe dollars. Comparing Putin to a president that sent hundreds of thousands of people to their death in order to "preserve the union" is hardly praise. Do they teach Austrian economics in Law/MBA school? Or are they still teaching that crazy Keynes theory?Prediction:"Final Warning for Long-term holders..."this will not be your "final warning" I sold all of my bitcoins. Now what?This was supposed to happen April 20th?This is going to be great! The states of the Union have seceded. A powerful leader decided that he does not want a nation divided so he is attacking the sovereign states to bring them back into the union.Thousands of lives will be lost, freedoms will be put on hold (suspending habeas corpus, martial law, etc..) but in the end, the union will be back together...which is all that matters...right? I agree, the risk is not worth it for such small returns. I only loaned out BTC on there after the rate went up as the price was falling the past few months. I sent someone a bitcoin and figured I would loan enough for enough time to get that bitcoin back.But after the Heartbleed thing I pulled all of my BTC to cold storage. Sidechains require destroying Bitcoin and making something different.No reason to change Bitcoin to use it for things other than currency. Though I will seriously be considering buying a lot in the Gults Gulch. Depending on the bitcoin price over the next few years. Chile is fairly stable except for the ground you stand on. If you cannot figure out how to use the blockchain for alternative things without actually changing Bitcoin itself, then you need to go back to the drawing board. Why not just short on BitFinex? Alt coins are a horrible way to use BTC to net more BTC, you could miss a good upswing. Especially doge which creates billions of coins per day killing the value over time.The best way to use BTC and keep your BTC while netting more BTC is via BitFinex...though I should not reveal this because the more people willing to loan BTC, the lower the return.  That is probably why nobody else mentioned it.Risk: You have to keep your bitcoins on the BitFinex website. After over a year, they are fairly trustworthy. However, the safest place is always in your cold storage. True story. I just saw .50 USD/mBTC on bitcoinity. Atlas shrugged Here's what happened when this was done:http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/1/4483048/hacker-who-demanded-1-million-in-bitcoins-from-mitt-romney-charged Someone already tried this.They sent a message to Mitt Romney saying that they had some damning information on him, gave a hint as to what it was using some wording from some paperwork of his, then asked for a million dollars in bitcoins by a certain date.Romney never paid it, the guy was eventually caught.
I have a tattoo of my private key on my privates. The bottom right now should be in the low 600s if we go by the market flow.The push below 400 was due to fear and uncertainty.Now that the fear is subsiding we should level back out to the 600s...however quickly we get there is up in the air. Whether or not we shoot past it probably depends upon a game changing event being announced or discovered on its way up. What is this sarcasm thing you speak of? Will the government provide this for me with the help of taxes? Step 1: bend overStep 2: take it from the IRSStep 3: Step 4: ROADS!!! Well, it happened OP.I took my garbage out to the road yesterday and nobody came to pick it up.I called the government today and asked why they did not pick up my garbage. They told me "some guy didn't pay taxes on his bitcoins so we don't have enough money to pick up garbage"Thanks a lot.I wish government wasn't the only entity that could provide garbage service. Yet, according to some people, it apparently is. No, all taxes pay for roads.Without taxes, roads disappear and we fall into big holes in the ground if we want to leave the house.Do you hate children? Because you did not pay your taxes there is a road somewhere that will disappear. I have been working on this site for a while and though there is plenty I need to work on, I figured I would open it up now so I can get things rolling.Check out: http://www.bitpools.comCreate an account, try things out.The beauty of BitPools is that you keep your bitcoins in your wallet until you and a large amount of people agree on something to spend your money on.When you create your account you will need to create an empty address, set that address to your account, then fill the address with some mBTC. From there you can join and create bitcoin pools.I will have a more robust way of reporting bugs, for now please post them here. Do you make money already?Can you spend a few hours each day doing that same thing outside of work and charge bitcoins? Or work up to being able to use your skills and talents for such a thing? It appears that only one is taking users, and they are the only one that have revealed their rate which is 10%. This tweet:https://twitter.com/BitPools/status/455557176166469632 lolclassic Wall Street money comes with strings attached.Let them keep their fiat investments. I never understood that, even with 9/11. Why go after the US citizens? Why not hit the government who is responsible for it all?Sure, the US citizens are stupid sheep that follow what the government says, but by targeting them you just allow the government to manipulate them into giving up even more power to their handlers. Thus you get things like drones and secret militaries because the government is "protecting us" from further attacks on citizens. The price for my last bitcoin is $1 trillion. Apparently, just last summer the BLM was slaughtering thousands of those tortoises and turned away people willing to adopt them to save them saying they're not "the ideal pet".http://www.infowars.com/before-nevada-cattle-rancher-dispute-blm-was-euthanizing-endangered-desert-tortoise/ Just curious about how much control Britain has over Turks & Caicos, do they have their own laws or the laws of Britain? And you know what happened after the Silk Road dip.Hint: Look what happens on the 9/29 barhttps://www.tradingview.com/v/7YEmxS3K/ You can't build a road to the moon.Crazy ruskies. I have been researching Turks & Caicos and economically they are excellent: NO INCOME TAX NO REAL ESTATE TAX NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX OR CAPITAL TRANSFER TAX NO VALUE ADDED TAX NO ESTATE DUTY TAX OR INHERITANCE TAX NO GIFT TAX NO LAND TAX NO WITHHOLDING TAX NO TAX TREATIES AND THEREFORE NO EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES NO EXCHANGE CONTROLS, NO RESTRICTION ON HOW MUCH CAN BE BROUGHT IN OR OUT OF THE COUNTRY ECONOMICALLY & POLITICALLY STABLE STRICT SECRECY LAWS EXCELLENT COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM LAWS CONDUCIVE TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN A TAX FREE ENVIRONMENT====I have not been able to find many references to social laws (prostitution, gambling, drugs, etc).Seems fairly libertarian. What do you think?
From the sound of things they will likely be holding a runoff election as there were around 8 candidates and the winner has to get over 50%. No problem, I think Blackwater changed their name. Though I haven't seen any since Iraq. The US is still at war in Afghanistan. Supposedly until December. And yes, I am a US citizen.The new era of wars is just using drones to kill anyone in the world. Heh, no I did not retire. I was actually in at $17 with $10k back in 2011, sold it at $12 as part of a downpayment on a house in 2012.I am still in Afghanistan (not a mercenary, I don't fight) making great money. The low price is actually wonderful for me and I am putting almost every cent into bitcoins.4 days What is this "sell" you speak of? I told my family about Bitcoin when it was worth $17 each.Over that year as it dropped to $2 I had to stay silent as I spent that time trying to get more bitcoins. Yes, please bring it back. At least once a day I am flagging a spam comment or an alt coin post in bitcoin discussion.And the amount of n00bs who actually do not like Bitcoin is idiotic (probably all created by Paul Krugman).At leave provide the option of an auto-ignore on all people with less than X amount of posts. It is time to stop worrying about price and work on getting as many bitcoins as possible.Old money cannot do what bitcoin can do, and you will want as many in your wallet as possible very soon.I will share more information in 5 days. In the meantime, buy into the panic. Today is a good day to buy. Chewbacca is from Endor.This makes no sense. Tell her you have a heroin addiction. She will understand why the money is gone and all will be well. If I had a bitcoin for every 400 Federal Reserve Notes Warren Buffet has...I would be a billionaire. That is the best time to buy. Exchanges are for buying bitcoins. I do recall one insurance company that showed up on here accepting bitcoins.They offered insurance for house, car, etc. I wish I could pay my mortgage with bitcoin.Banks and government will be the last places you can use bitcoin. Also, realize that when you send bitcoins, it sends a large amount of your bitcoins out and sends "change" to another address. It is common that people watch an address, send some bitcoins, then freak out that they just lost a bunch of bitcoins from their address. Download vanitygen.exeGet a public address, write down the private address.Send your BTC to the public address. Some good panic.Now would be a good time.I wish my IRS refund would go through sooner. This is some tasty panic. People who believe Bitcoin is a Ponzi are usually not willing to pay attention to a single sentence response disproving their statement, much less watch a full 4 minute video   I used to invest in gold.When the market crashes, so does the price of gold. At least in the short term. Over a long period of time they tend to be opposite though. How much volume was China based when the price went from $12 to $266 in 3 months?
 Welcome to April. The blockchain is math, it is why we like Bitcoin and believe it can be used to achieve great things.But if you move away from the blockchain, you start introducing things other than math. You start adding things like trust, force, faith and you get the same system that Bitcoin was created to replace.When a company takes bitcoins from the blockchain ledger and creates their own ledger, then you are putting faith into their ledger over a proven math based system.When government says they are going to regulate bitcoin, they can only use force against things other than the math of the blockchain.Invest and support those systems that are closest to the blockchain, avoid those that are furthest from it. So many people that do not understand inherent rights.Slaves bein slaves. I am not a political party. Looking at the exchanges, there is bitcoins being traded for government money. As government money is traded for bitcoin there always has to be someone selling bitcoins for government money. So, how would we ever replace that money if it is always being traded?The ideal scenario is to only sell your bitcoins in order to pay off your debts and to work toward getting paid in nothing but bitcoin.That way, the Federal Reserve will have all of their Federal Reserve Notes with nobody willing to accept them. I am not saying that this would happen in a short amount of time, I am saying this is the ideal way to replace government money.Give unto the Federal Reserve what is the Federal Reserve's. Just keep in perspective what each site is selling.Schiff is selling gold.Bloomberg, Business Insider, Motley Fool, etc. are selling stocks and funds.Most of the other media is selling socialism. does it matter? I would start by asking them to explain the bank routing system as well as how debit transfers work and how your transaction is secured.You know...just so you have a starting point. Looks familiar.ponzi tulip bubble! I happened upon a gypsy wagon in middle of the dark forest that told me in July that Bitcoin will reach $2250.I looked away for a moment, then turned back to ask about Litecoin but the wagon was....gone....  The US debt bubble will pop! We will be in single digit debt by the end of the year!tulips anyone?ponzi So they take everyone's bitcoins promising miners and give them...a TV show!What a great funding strategy.Nobody would have sent their bitcoins if they knew they were funding a TV show. Sneak peek:beta testers needed (opening April 15) There has been so much research done on this, millions of dollars worth.http://www.seasteading.org/overview/Buying an island controlled by another nation is no different thanhttp://galtsgulchchile.com/ I had most of my BTC in 1ELWAR1 for a long time. Not anymore. I really want to buy more but I usually wait and buy on panics.I have not seen any major panics yet. Huobi and/or BTCChina going down may cause a panic. Then you will see the floor. So, what did you end up buying with your Bitcoin currency OP? I started investing in a few alts but then realized that with each new alt it does not really dilute Bitcoin, it dilutes all alt coins.The key to a currency is the Network Effect, where a currency reaches critical mass. Once that happens, it competes with established currencies. Bitcoin is on its way to reaching that point. No other alt is even close.If I had a few extra days to work on it I would create an alt generator to create a new alt every hour. What do you think would happen to the alt coins? They would all be diluted to the point where nobody would ever touch them.Bitcoin and a million alts does nothing to Bitcoin. Would you be willing to pledge 10 bitcoins towards buying a small island?Not hand over to me or anyone, just set aside 10 of your current bitcoins in your own wallet toward this goal.This is assuming a few years of hashing things out before anyone would need to send their bitcoins and a significant increase in the value of those 10 bitcoins. A goal of 200 people pledged with a final 100 people agreeing on the final decision and actually following through with the payment.
In French Polynesia, a territory of France. I have been down this road before. Much further than just chatting about ideas online.As part of the Free State Project a group of us were going to work on buying land for a "free town" type of project. Discussion went on for months. We weighed different parts of the state with graphs and voting numbers and laws and every type of analysis we could come up with.Finally we determined that if 50 of us put in $10k each we would have enough to buy a large lot of land that could be divided between us with the goal of around 5-10 acres each. So we had one guy who lived in the state who's dad did that type of real estate business himself who was just getting into starting his own business start working on setting things up for us. He set up a corporation and started setting out to find land. He had a contract written up and asked for people to start submitting their checks, with a signed contract from him and us.It ended up with just 2 of us (me and another couple) sending him $10k. Meanwhile he's driving all over the state taking pictures and talking to land owners, sending us everything we want, but nobody else ponied up any cash. He ended up giving the money back, losing out on time and money.It ended up that everyone was all talk with no ability to actually invest in such an idea. The discussions died off and that was the end of it.That is why I started working on BitPools. Where you can keep your bitcoins in your wallet but can pledge your money toward such a goal. If enough people pledge to the point that it is a viable possibility it is only then that people will start working on actual proposals. Then people can vote with their bitcoin on whichever idea they like best and the project gets funded. I love supporting sites like these.Be careful, bitspend.com had their bank account frozen doing this. I know I can send bitcoins to someone from coinbase having just their e-mail. Perhaps someone can send a request in the same way. Great idea! Go find a piece of land over -200 ft sea level that is not owned by a government and get back to us.Hint: no land exists that is not controlled by a government (not even land underwater other than several miles deep hundreds of miles away from land)However...there are some projects in the works.For a small piece of land where bitcoin is accepted, as has been mentioned before there is:http://galtsgulchchile.comFor a project to dock a ship in international waters outside of prosperous cities (accepting bitcoin donations):http://blueseed.co/For a project to create a floating platform under no government rule (eventually):http://www.seasteading.org/floating-city-project/Finally, when it comes to coordination...I hope to set up a Pool for those interested in such a venture when I open the BitPools site (a few weeks). Doing so does not put money into one person's hands while trying to figure out what everyone wants. A lot of posts after the fact that you can spend Bitcoin at Walmart has been pointed out.http://www.gyft.com/merchants/walmart/Which begs the question...do people want Walmart to start accepting Bitcoin so that they can start spending their bitcoin there?Or do they want this just so the price will go up? If I go and buy $250k worth of bitcoins and then buy a house with $200k worth of those, then the seller would have to fill out a 1099 for receiving over $600 worth of a commodity.For your tax purposes you have gained nothing and do not have to claim any income.Now, if you had bought the bitcoin for $50k and it appreciated to $200k you would need to claim $150k as income when purchasing the house.If instead he "donates" the house to you, you would then have to claim it as $200k worth of income. If you are a charity then you would have to deal with a $200k donation.However...using the IRS code, there are ways of making a $150k gain in a year something less, spread over many years. All legally of course. And I am not a tax lawyer yada yada yada... We visited this issue a long time ago. I believe someone added a link to some tor porn image. If it was child porn I do not recall.This was years ago. Some people made a big deal out of it. Nothing came of it. The law they figured out that it was no big deal. I am glad there are so many one percenters here who have more money than you need and will soon be giving away most of it to the 99%. There is no anarchist/government. You have pinpointed the exact way of things. People with guns and power can do whatever they want against people with less power and guns.Your neighbor coming to your house with a gun is the same thing as the government coming to your house with a gun. Some people pool their money for protection. But after some time you are no longer paying just for protection, you are also paying for whatever crazy ideas those with power may want. And the more money and power they get, the more insane things they can come up without your permission because there is no competition and no one else to go to for protection. According to this chart https://www.tradingview.com/v/7YEmxS3K/ we moving far too quickly downward. A correction may push the price up prematurely. Great idea, you should buy as many alt coins as possible. The best ones are the ones that are clones of Bitcoin but have funny names. Those are so funny that you would be crazy not to dump a buttload of money into them.Best to leave Bitcoins to the rest of us. That is the opposite of what I do.Go to Walmart and buy a high priced item using my gyft gift card (paid for with bitcoins) which gives me a 3% discount.Return the item and get 100% cash back.Then use that cash to buy bitcoins on Bitstamp driving the price UP!rinse and repeat This.No need to carry cash if you want to shop at Walmart and many many other major chains. While a young, internationally attacked non-government is supposed to represent the ideal libertarian utopia?  Has nobody here used CoinBase?50BTC limit. No waiting for ACH. If you give your login information you can have an account within an hour./endthread CoinBase You can already use bitcoins to shop at Walmart. Ancient Chinese secret eh??? Thank you. I might find a way to implement these into my website. If I do I will certainly drop you a tip.
I will start by saying that I like this idea and it is something the whole Bitcoin community was waiting for years ago when we were promised the Bitcoin MasterCard.The biggest thing people will likely balk at is the 10% fee per purchase (I know, it is cut to 5% with referrals). I will say that this will turn off many people, and justifiably so. But I will say that last month when I was in Paris I used my American Express card a few times and they charged me a 3% conversion fee on every purchase, so 5% is not a huge stretch for foreign travel.First question would be, do we have to fill the card before a purchase? Or can we swipe a card and have our Bitcoins automatically converted (which would create the follow up question of: do we have to have our bitcoins on your online wallet?).If we need to fill the card beforehand, how long does it take to convert to fiat?You mention using the card in foreign countries, do we have to specify which currency it is converted to? Is there a foreign currency fee?I think this is a great step forward and helps Bitcoin. A lower fee would be better but I imagine that would come with time and competition. I can see this as a handy tool for having an emergency debit card. Not so much an every day choice. I think if you got the rate down to 3% you would be competitive with the credit card companies. A study examining Somalias performance relative to other African countries both when Somalia had a government and during its extended period of anarchy found that Somalia, when subjected to an honest comparison between Somalia when it had a functioning government, and Somalia now is less poor, has higher life expectancy, and has experienced a drastic increase in telephone lines. I like the style that I posted. Your third link is good as well.Example categories would be something like:investments, charities, film & video, art, etc.. In WWII Germany those under the foot of the Nazi government would probably consider themselves libertarians (anti-government) even if they favored taxes, regulations and other government policies.But as the government becomes worse, we all become libertarian in some way or another. Actually the bottom was $400, though it was very brief (got most of mine at $450). Just some simple flat icons in this type of style: Many would have thought that there would be no way to have a currency without government.People think the same things about other government services. As for Somolia...compare it now to when it had a government. You may be surprised. I need about a dozen 'category' type of images 260x200.Would rather pay someone here in bitcoin as opposed to going to another site that would charge a fee to send the money. They have for years now. PBOC is the government? They have the backing of guns?What does PBOC mean? Which division of the Chinese government does it stand for? Sure, I see a lot more posts in here by clueless people who worship at the alter of big government. More as it has gone more mainstream.But we are still here. Hi!Oh, and I like how they like to use the less prevalent Silk Road as "proof" that libertarians are going away.And yes, we all already knew that we had to pay taxes on our bitcoin earnings. But we will let you think that you are getting what you want...keep driving up the value of our huge Bitcoin wallets. Most of the first Prius owners were white males. Should we all avoid buying a Prius because of the racial makeup of its early adopters?Tesla?The Internet? According to http://www.globalrichlist.com/ if you make more than $32,000 you are among the richest people in the world.Also if you have more than 1400 bitcoins you can consider yourself among the wealthiest 1% in the world along with the Rockafellers and Venderbuilts. Also, if you make more than $32,000 per year I hope you do what you can to distribute your wealth to other nations as one of the 1% richest people in the world.http://www.globalrichlist.com/ During the last price spike it was shown that the higher the price, the more the wealth is distributed.Those people with big wallets started selling.Though if wealth distribution is your thing...Bitcoin is probably not for you. You should stick with currency backed by guns. Yes, the price appears to be on the low end right now and would require a lot of pressure to keep it this low for very long.From the charts it looks like June will be the next jump through July as many on here have been predicting. Just passing along the chart, I forgot who posted it originally. I laugh at the day traders who buy and sell stuff on Ebay.Haha suckers, the price of your clock you sold me went up over the past 5 years! You're probably broke by now. It has been shown that the exchange volume is about 1/6th of the daily bitcoin volume. Which could easily estimate that only 1/6th of the mined coins are sold on the exchanges.This would be only $330k per day going out. With VCs like SecondMarket who said their clients tend to invest $25-50 million, you would only need one of those investments every 3 months to keep the price stable. 4 investors per year.There will be many more than that. And in 2 years, the mining is cut in half. Umm, this was true a long time ago.The exchanges get around this by selling vouchers for cash which can be used on their exchange as cash.
Bitcoin price will likely rise in 2016 due to halfing.But you can look at this chart to get a good idea of the range of the price over the rest of the year:https://www.tradingview.com/v/7YEmxS3K/ This reminds me of political articles that always start out by describing every detail of the politician they are interviewing "he sits slumped in his chair, a mild grin upon his face with light locks of gray...blah blah blah"it is helpful because you know early into the article that this author can be ignored because they are not so much providing information but trying to impress the readers with their ability to use a thesaurusPlease continue posting the way you do OP, it saves me the clicking of the Ignore button(also, when I start watching a movie and the main character is a writer it tells me the movie will suck) Countries with no income tax:Bermuda (Social Security tax - 31BMD/week) Cayman IslandsBahrain (3% Social Security tax) Marshall Islands Turks & Caicos Islands Qatar (10% Corporate tax) UAE The price had been stable (and slightly declining) for far too long...if you look at a log chart the price was far below the line by the time October came around but I think people were just stuck in the mindset that the price was what it was supposed to be so nobody risked going too high or too low.Then Silk Road was busted and the price dropped about 40% shaking things up, then the price came back up.This got a lot of media attention along with the idea that the fact that the Bitcoin price was still back to where it was and a little higher meant that Bitcoin wasn't just a bunch of drug users on Silk Road. So the price started going up slowly.Then China started buying. The price correction of such a long stagnant price combined with the idea that the Chinese would be huge adopters sent the price up higher and higher. This created some media buzz around Bitcoin and more people started jumping in both in the US and in China.Looking at a log scale again you would see that the price went above the line. News about China "banning" Bitcoin dropped the price down and it started moving back to where the price should be on the log scale after a while. The MtGox fiasco has kept us on the low end of the log scale and every piece of news about MtGox pushes the price lower.Check this chart to see it a bit more clearly:https://www.tradingview.com/v/7YEmxS3K/ Is that site just another way of getting a bunch of ugly overweight dudes paired up with homely women with daddy issues? This is great.I have not used their service yet since I do not have a smart phone but is it something where you can just get the price at the register then buy the card on your phone and scan it? The gas tax to pay for roads is about the "least bad". It is as close to a pay per use as you can get. The two issues need to be separated.I am all for building roads and giving away money to needy people and ponies for children and free medical care.I would love to give that all away to everyone. I think everyone should have a million dollars to spend on whatever they want.That would be so great. And I show compassion by saying that I want everyone to have that so that makes it even better.I want everyone to have access to doctoral level education and we should fly spaceships to the moon again, to Mars, and other planets and beyond!Aren't I great? I want to give away so much, I must be the most compassionate person in the world!Now give me your money to pay for my compassion. Oh, and if you do not men with guns will throw you in jail.  Why leave one oppressive regime for another? I have seen this lately...another article said Bitcoin "caught us by surprise".As if the statists learning about Bitcoin and starting to think about the implications of disrupting their system wish they'd caught it earlier so they could have worked to squash it earlier. Instead it had enough momentum before they found out and they were caught off guard.Now they are praying that since they just found out about it and that they have seen talk about it for a few months they are just closing their eyes hoping that it will go away like a fad.We are just getting started.Someone is worried about their government money fad ending. I cannot wait for the "remember when" stories about government money. Dogcoin was funny for a few minutes.Someone needs to make another meme based coin using cats. They are funny too sometimes.Maybe that grumpy cat meme. Drop me a few million of them if you spend the 10 minutes to copy Bitcoin to create this. Opinion based on ignorance.There are already such things without government involvement. Hell, my fire department is private. Sheep only see the sheep's ass in front of them and think that that is the world they need to follow.Again, people are ok with using force against humans as long as there is some benefit. Like with slavery. I got the $1 million per day from here:http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/22/will-bitcoin-destroy-big-government.aspx"Indeed, while Overstock.com may accept bitcoin, it doesn't store them -- all the bitcoins Overstock.com takes in (now worth more than $1 million per day) are converted directly to U.S. dollars."Though from http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304815004579418962232488216 I see:"The company will keep 10% of its revenue from bitcoin sales in the virtual currency, with the intent of eventually offering it as payment for vendors and employees. Mr. Byrne said the company now holds bitcoins worth "tens of thousands" of dollars."This is encouraging.Motley Fool does tend to attack Bitcoin every chance they get so they are likely misquoting the figure with no care for correcting it. They do have a bunch of worthless stocks to hock. Overstock claims they are selling about $1 million worth of goods per day. And they are currently converting those bitcoins to dollars. Essentially a million dollars worth of bitcoins is being sold every day. This is not miners mining and being Bitcoin supporters so they are more likely to hold than sell, but certain selling. At the moment $1 million would send the price down $30. It may not go down that far completely due to other adoption but it is a constant drain.We always fought for the chicken vs egg thing of people not having something to spend bitcoins on so they didn't buy them (which discouraged people from offering things for sale for bitcoins) but now that we have someone big offering people the opportunity to spend them on everyday items, it may be draining the price.It is good in the long run because it encourages adoption (and they said they would start holding some bitcoins soon) but in the short term is it pushing the price down?And will this happen every time a huge retailer starts accepting bitcoin?Edit: Article I took the $1 million per day from was 100% typo by the writer of article. Best time to buy is when people are panicking.Not sure when that is? That is when you start questioning whether Bitcoin will survive <insert major story here>. There are plenty of people with those answers...but, how would YOU do it?In the age of information, knowledge is a choice. I may be interested in this some time in the fall. So using force against humans is only bad when used towards a specific group of people? People supported slavery too.And when they talked about it, they always talked about the benefits...not the use of force against humans. I would bet that most of the numbers in that study are based on raw numbers and not percentages. Florida has a huge amount of homeless. Great weather all year round for them.
Sounds about right. If you would like to help in beta testing let me know. From all of my research it appears that Turks & Caicos is very business friendly. I have been considering basing my online Bitcoin business out of there. Does anyone know of any difficulties I might face? Will they have any issues with a Bitcoin business?There will be no fiat money involved in the business, everything will be in bitcoins. I just want to find out first if there have been any moves there to outlaw Bitcoin businesses (though I doubt they would since they seem very open to businesses). I thought dogcoin was funny for like 10 seconds.Though I may have missed the joke because I did not see the original meme pictures.It is about as amusing as kanyecoin though. And I know who Kanye is. No, I agree that the blockchain is the right technology. It is the most secure way of voting, the amount of computing power using it as a currency makes it about the most secure way to vote in the world.But the way votes in current government structures are used is ancient (literally). You vote for some people to go represent you and they go on to use that as justification to use a military and police to "morally" steal money from people to "do what you ask of them".What Bitcoin and the blockchain can do is cut the government middleman. You want a problem solved? 1. You and others who agree that it is a problem pledge some bitcoins toward the problem.2. People propose solutions to the problem, along with the cost.3. You and others vote with your pledged bitcoins via the blockchain. If the cost is covered, the proposer gets the bitcoins. Otherwise the money stays with you and the others.4. The problem is solved, people are not forced to pay for your problem, you get what you want to pay for. College is a lazy way of proving that you have some understanding of the job you plan on taking.The price of college is following the same progress of the housing bubble for the same reasons that housing prices skyrocketed.Wait until the prices crash or build a portfolio for the kind of work you plan on going into.Personally, I work for the government and they have formulas they use for salary which uses college degrees to determine your salary. So I used my work tuition payment to get my Master's degree. I did not choose my degree for gaining any knowledge but on getting through it easily so that I can get a higher salary because I have a higher degree.  This is great, I hope they have one in each terminal at the airport. The last time I was there I had to pay to get USD out of the ATM and then pay to convert those USD to AED (helps to have cash to pay for a cab from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1).  I did see that you forked it off of the voting thread but brought up voting for small projects or businesses in your OP. Why create a new coin that is more vulnerable to a "51% attack" when we already have a very secure blockchain that can be used for this? And the blockchain can be used for not only voting but for business budgets, decision making, etc. Finally someone to debunk all of this pseudo-science!I see it with my own eyes every day. The sun is obviously rotating around the Earth.Open your eyes people!  Someone got paid Friday and is waiting for his money to get to his exchange account.For someone who knows anything about Bitcoin to think that the bank is the safest place for his money shows how serious he actually is.And don't forget to declare all that money you just dumped into your bank account on your taxes. You are looking at it all wrong if you are thinking that the blockchain can be used to make the current government voting structure better.That is like saying that you want to use Bitcoin to make the dollar better. That is not the goal, we are looking to replace government money, not improve it.Thus, the same needs to be done for voting. We can have a better voting system and replace current government structures and have the first ever fully voluntary government (if you think your current government is voluntary, try not paying taxes and see where that gets you).It will take time to grow that large but Bitcoin has made that possible. 1. started with 1 or 2 people :/2. The PMs were so that people could stay anonymous other than the guy running it.3. Performance was inconsequential.  The Bitcoin blockchain is the best way forward for voting because it is probably the most secure ledger in the world. If people like this concept and want to help beta test it, send me a PM. I will be opening up Beta testing on using the blockchain for voting in about a week.I already have the voting working, I just want people to go through the process to find any bugs in the interface so I can open up a professional, useful site in about a month (have been working on the site for the past year, working on the concept for much longer).I will be using the test chain as opposed to the blockchain for beta testing (though it currently works using the blockchain, I need to add some code for the test blockchain). I believe at one point there was a website where people could go to sign up to be beta testers or sign up to pay beta testers for testing?Does that still exist?Also, is there a convenient online Bitcoin wallet using the test chain? If your idea of a social organization requires that everyone follow this social behavior, then you have already taken a step away from peace.The only way your theory can work is if everyone is allowed to do what they want and still have peace. Does your organization allow that?There are plenty of social thoughts that begin with "if only everyone would do X, then everything would all be perfect". This does not work. Never has, and never will. Stability fuels the rocket. I was part of a small group that did this a few years ago.Basically you would PM the guy who was coordinating it. He would send out a message to the other members with "1 member is selling at $4.35".It ended up only about 2 or 3 of us other than the coordinator. And it was not very useful. I have seen voting work using the blockchain.Though I have not implemented it in such a way as to be used in a current government type of election.That is the past.See my sig. This is the end of the Internet for sure.It is just a ponzi scheme. Its bubble is about to burst. Ebay started out in new territory of online auctions.As they became more popular, they started getting more and more scammers.They came up with the feedback system and other means of self regulating.How many Congressional hearings have there been to regulate Ebay?
You said she has been there.She has not. Avoid it now while you have the choice.Before the government steps in to "save us". Ummm...no it is not.They said they will make sure the exchanges and ATMs comply with their money laundering laws. She has a booking link on her website (based out of Canada, where she lives...not Thailand):http://www.jennifernguyen.ca/book-me/ Noticed an attack on my laptop from Ukraine (could have easily been one of many hops).I suspect that since MtGox's database was hacked, they are going through accounts that had large withdraws and hitting IPs or e-mails.I immediately moved all coins to cold storage. I had that happen as well. Freaked out the first time.And it happened a few times after that as well where the initial check of the address caught me by surprise. My water company is private. Basically well water filtered and sent to my home.Food regulations prevent me from being able to drink healthy milk from a cow.I guess these types of posts are what comes with more Bitcoin adoption by the masses. Regulation = men with guns telling you what to do.I could just as easily tell you what to do without a gun, will that appease you? Why do you like being told what to do? Are you a masochist?Or is it that you think other people should be told what to do at the point of a gun?So you like to play God with other people's lives?Here is a suggestion. How about if you spend less time worrying about how other people run their lives and focus on living your own. I am just about to open my site, BitPools, for beta testing.One of the main categories is VC funding for new startups.It should make things a lot easier for people looking to put their bitcoins to some use toward something big. The government has a monopoly on force.How are laws imposed? Force.How are taxes collected?Force. That is so sad. The girl is Canadian and tells on her blog about her first time to Asia starting in December. She went to Hong Kong, some places in China, Taiwan. And since December 27 she has been in the Philippines.Why would you travel in Thailand for a girl who lives in Canada (who has never been to Thailand)?http://www.jennifernguyen.ca/ You can exchange for Ron at: https://www.btcxchange.ro/ Care to put your money where your mouth is?$10k by the end of 2016:http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532 I have a drunk friend who said he will be getting drunk on March 16 for St Patrick's Day and he also trades bitcoins.So...he might drunk sell all of his bitcoins.Or drunk buy.The future is always changing. I usually take into account the likelihood that the USD will lose value when I project it to be worth $10k by 2016.But that is only one factor. I also consider adoption rates and value added technology.I always wonder at what point I should pay off my home mortgage...pay 5% per year or keep that money in Bitcoin and make over 1000% per year?I have concluded that I will reserve 1 Bitcoin solely to pay off my mortgage. That is based both on the fact that the USD will lose that much value and that Bitcoin will gain that much value. 4/1/2014: $980$800 on: 3/26/2014 I did not realize I could go to the Bitcoin Foundation to check out Bitcoin companies and complain about problems. Thank you for the info, do you have a link for this? Hence why you hire police to protect you from kidnapping. Pretty funny.Like trying to explain the Internet to older people when I was younger.The biggest critique? "Why are the letters green? What an ugly color." (referring to the ANSI coloring on the BBS I was on) Hmm, you could sacrifice your computer resources by running a CPU miner basically having to buy a whole computer if you want to mine Bitcoins since you cannot do anything else while it is mining.Or you can buy an ASIC for 100 bucks that plugs into your USB that can be running while you plug away at whatever you want on your computer.I never mined bitcoins until I bought an ASIC on ebay. Before that it was always too complicated and would have slowed down my computer while trying to do anything on it.
Bitcoin is the Rearden Metal of Atlas Shrugged.It is a provably superior alternative to the current currency but there is such a huge industry built around the old currency that it is attacked by all aspects of the currency industry from Keynesian professors to central banks to government agencies.Just like with Rearden Metal the special committee of the National Council of Metal Industries came out with reports talking about how unsafe it was. They could not provide any proof but they had several warnings against it."They said Rearden Metal is a threat to public safety. They said its chemical composition is unsound, it's brittle, it's decomposing molecularly, and it will crack suddenly without warning [.....] They're experts, though, the men on that committee. Top experts. Chief metallurgists for the biggest corporations, with a string of degrees from universities all over the country."People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. What I've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one's master, condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that person's view requires to be faked. Hank Rearden We are already over half way to $800 in less than half a month. I would say we are right on track. Actually, in such a scenario the rich would be a target of the police forces of the poor. While it may not be financially beneficial to get into gun fights with your neighbor over an acre of land, and thus an agreement would need to be made. The rich would need to hire much better police forces because it is financially beneficial for the poor police forces to bind together to take land from the rich (assuming such land is the source of the riches, or even contains wealth that can be taken). The rich would be obligated to pay more for police protection. How would they be compelled to pay for the police?Assuming everyone is using Bitcoin, their money cannot be stolen at the point of a gun. Open your mind for a moment and imagine a few hundred people on an island starting with no laws.With no laws and no way to enforce them they start to run into problems, some murders, theft, property is taken, people build a house and assume they own the land only to have their neighbors think that they own a different part, etc...People start arming themselves and try to protect themselves and their property but most find that they have to go to work, they cannot stay at home all of the time so a private police force offers to protect peoples' properties for them, some people like it and pay for this police force to protect their home from intruders. The police force is given boundaries of peoples' properties and disputes are worked out to come up with clear property lines.Some people do not agree with the lines and go with their own police force, a few police forces pop up and pretty soon there are property line disputes between police forces. One guy says an acre is his while another says it is his. They both call out their police forces to keep the other off of their property and soon there is a stand off between forces. Both are right, they are protecting lawful property and a firefight between forces breaks out.The next time funding for the force comes up, both forces raise rates for those home owners to deal with the extra cost of a firefight with the other force. After some time both land owners realize it is cheaper to come to an agreement on property lines than keep paying higher costs to the police. So they make compromises and the rates go down.Now imagine one group of people really hates gays, they pass a 'law' against gay marriage. Basically they authorize their police force to go in and kidnap and punish a gay couple. The gay couple is paying another police force to protect their property from intruders (including police) and protect them from kidnapping. The gay law police come to kidnap and imprison the couple and the kidnap protecting police are called to protect them. Another stand off and possible gun fight ensues...At this point the people who hate gays are told their rates will go up in order to pay for gun fights with other police forces. The battles are costly so the gay haters have to decide if it is fiscally worth it to have such a law. Over time it would not make sense to pay for gun fights.After a while, the cheapest route for all users of the police forces would be to agree on what 'laws' to impose, and it would gravitate toward such a common agreed law of the land with very few subtle differences. You would also have to factor in people who do not use a police force and protect their own properties and lives. Any outside force used against them or their lifestyle would bring with it a cost that would likely not be worth the higher rate.Thoughts? With no laws and people willing to pay for competing police protection, how do you think things would end up? Should we institute something like the Better Business Bureau for Bitcoin companies?Companies sign up on the BCBB website and allow users to post any problems they have had with the company along with any resolutions.The company pays the site for accreditation, users get to check out a company before using them and the decent companies get more users.(I would say just go with BBB but they are not international, and they may not understand how Bitcoin companies work) Wallets should only be used when you go to spend.All other times your balance should remain in cold storage. If we hit $800 by the end of March that will be the first doubling with 3 or 4 after that with half time in between each.Meaning:price double1: $400-$800   1 month2: $800-$1600  2 weeks3: $1600-$3200  1 week4?: $3200-$6400  somewhere in this range will be the top a few days after $3200  The whole point of Bitcoin is no more need for banks.It would be like burning mp3s onto a tape cassette that then uses a special player that can read the mp3s. Then complaining when you lose your mp3 collection because the tape got caught in the player. Ron Paul says no:Don't ask government to regulate Bitcoinhttp://www.ronpaulchannel.com/video/dont-ask-government-regulate-bitcoin/?utm_source=RPFBG&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=DailyUpdate I did a panic long and a panic short...I hope I do not get squeezed!Or I hope I do? I predict a panic sell by some weak hands, unfortunately it will probably bounce back before my paycheck arrives in my bank tomorrow to take advantage of another dip.Short term though, this should bring a lot more media attention to Bitcoin which is usually followed by more adoption by the masses. It seemed like most liberal news articles always referred to Satoshi as a person or "group of people" who came up with Bitcoin.Always falling back on the idea that a single individual is not intelligent enough to accomplish anything, that it must always be a group effort.Much respect for Mr. Nakamoto for his creation, may he be left alone as he wishes. Venezuela has been using the US as a boogyman for years.Part of their propaganda to give more power to the centralized government.Kinda like muslims and terrorists...every government has its boogyman. Used to build power.The US will not be far behind Venezuela on our own socialist train wreck. But I am not so confident our citizens will revolt, new plasma TVs will allow us to watch more propaganda news while sitting on our asses complaining about things. The US is not a democracy. Never was. this Most likely because Bloomberg is very invested in the way the stock market works right now. Any alternative is a threat. Or buy a laptop exclusively for cold storage only. Bloomberg is very anti-Bitcoin. I see more and more articles where some rich guy says "I bought a lot of bitcoins a few months ago". I always think...when was that? What did it do to the price? Were they part of one of the uptrends?There are a lot of rich people out there. The more that are exposed to Bitcoin, the more of these guys will jump in and buy a bunch. News articles about how the Bitcoin price is dropping is like chumming the waters for rich investors.Even a guy at work who knows about Bitcoin but was never interested in buying said he wanted to buy some after hearing that the price was lower because an exchange went down.
Currently the bet is winning that Bitcoin will reach $10,000 in 2016.http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532 Traditional TA will not work with Bitcoin until enough people who believe in traditional TA are speculating.It is a self fulfilling prophecy. I am interested in speaking at this conference. I have been through Dubai several times in the past year and believe my topic would go over well there. Wow...the way your mind works. Do you think we will just fly in with a spaceship, get some wood and build a frame house and move in?Do people on submarines drown? Or freeze to death from the cold? It's impossible to breath underwater, people would have to wear SCUBA gear for the rest of their lives. $850 that fast would have actually not been that great of a thing.It needs to go up gradually throughout the month in order to snowball into another huge rally. Florida - not available What do you think the catalyst will be for this jump? Ukraine? UK adoption? End of MtGox? A new technology using the blockchain (hint: see my sig)? OP is a pump and dumper!!! He will make millions selling at $840 before midnight!!! Most software engineers do have vision, they tend to be problem solvers.Your best bet is to start using your many bitcoins on a daily basis. You will likely run into some problems in doing so. Solve those problems with software.If you have another skill or passion, combine it with software and bitcoins. Quite a long time. Ya, that's always the way to peace. They invested the bank's money in Bitcoin at $800. Think Progress is racist. MtGox =/= BitcoinSo one exchange is having troubles. We get it, move on. Sounds like something for Service Discussion. Or create a MtGox subforum next to the Scammer section. The GOX mess has been bringing the price down since $800...we need to let it go. Gox is a drain on Bitcoin. The exchanges are a small percentage of the Bitcoin economy. It is only there that the price is determined. Not the mined coins.If you and I are the only people exchanging oranges for apples and all other apples and oranges are stored, if you give me 100 oranges for 1 apple...then that will be the price for all others.People are quick to complain about the hoarding of coins, then bring up the "cost per day" required to pay for mined coins. The only thing to change the price is the amount of dollars and bitcoins going into the exchanges. Manchin is a single senator with no power when the Republican House is in charge of passing laws. A petition will do nothing. We have Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin address.Remember when we used that information to link the address to the person? Which government will stop Bitcoin?
I am not understanding.How do you want the government's guns to be used against Bitcoin users? The first doubling of the $400 low will be within a month. I have made a lot of money off of the Bitcoin volatility. Am I doing all of those things you were talking about?All I do is buy when everyone is shitting their pants and hold off from buying when the price is skyrocketing.Am I a Chinese genius? I hope you do not open e-mail from people in Africa. Your theory needs to use 1337 to be even cooler. When family members are worried...that is the best time to buy.There are people like that out there with bitcoins selling right now. All on bad FUD. And they will buy back in higher when they realize they were duped. "Cheesburger in paradise."-- Jimmy Buffett This all feels a lot like what happened after Silk Road was busted.The price was around $120, then crashed down to around $90/BTC. The media hailed it as the end of Bitcoin.The next day the price came back up to $120 and kept climbing. The media still kept talking about how Bitcoin was finished.Within two months, the price of Bitcoin was over $1,200.Now after MtGox goes away.The price was around $550 then crashed to around $400/BTC. The media hails it as the end of Bitcoin.The next day the price comes back up over $550 and keeps climbing. The media still keep talking about how Bitcoin is finished.Within two months, price of Bitcoin over $5,500? bitcoinity.org shows the top 4 exchanges based upon volume. MtGox is already down to 3 and will likely fall off in a few hours due to no volume.Most price averages have already dropped MtGox.If they come back online, even with new ownership they will be starting behind even new exchanges due to the negativity surrounding them. You missed the bottom. It was $400/BTC. $535 on btcchina now. Well, I hope it is gradual over the course of the month. Otherwise it would be too fast. If it takes the whole month then we will be on pace for a new ATH. Too early, and it is just regular volatility. Based upon past capitulation events and with a floor of $400/BTC I predict that the price of Bitcoin will reach $800 by April.Based on the numbers at that point, those that have been through this a few times should be able to get an idea of the next peak. Let the record show that the first half of Smoothie's prediction was right.MtGox closing caused the price to drop to $400/BTC.Good call Smoothie. What I do not understand is...the panic sellers are on other exchanges selling...they know that there are other exchanges besides MtGox because they are on those exchangesand those exchanges work...I don't get it, but hey...cheap coins Buying bitcoins is never a waste of fiat.Good luck trying to catch the falling knife. I think I still had about .004+ in there.It was too small to move out, or bother with.When the price is $100,000/BTC I will shed a tear in my caviar on my yacht about the coins that got away. MtGox not being able to handle a DDOS caused the price to crash about 50% almost a year ago.MtGox stopped allowing people to withdraw fiat from the exchange.MtGox stopped allowing people to withdraw bitcoins from the exchange.Fool me once... If you have not seen people warning 1000s of times before, listen now.MtGox has screwed over its users time and time again. If MtGox comes up and you feel the urge to use them as an exchange...please just PM me and I will give you a BTC address to send your bitcoins.If you have your bitcoins on a website, or they are sitting on your computer that is connected to the Internet. Send me a PM and I will give you a BTC address to send your bitcoins where they will be safe from hackers. Granted, they will also be safe from you as well.If you do want to use an exchange, I suggest Bitstamp, BitFinex, CoinBase (for people in the US).If you have purchased bitcoins, put them in cold storage!What is cold storage? Bitcoin addresses consist of a public and a private key. The public key is where you send the bitcoins, anyone can see that. The private key is like your password to move your bitcoins stored in the public key. Cold storage is putting that private key in a place not accessible by some guy in Russia connected to your Internet connected computer or telephone.Look up cold storage on here, there are many many many ideas on how to do it. Once you do it, it is easy from there on. You are your own bank. Your money is only as safe as you want it to be. Glad they got more coins together to purchase. I got a good chunk from them as well.
I can see MtGox coming back. But what will be the most puzzling thing will be the people that still use that exchange. For those who did...thank you. The only people who lost money on MtGox are people who like to take abuse. The only thing people will do when they find Mark is bend over and ask for more. With these cheap ~$400 prices we are all early adopters right now. If you have fiat and are not buying, do not complain when we are at $5,000 later this year and people talk about the small percentage of people who are holding most of the coins.Today was a great buying day for me. Thank you all you panic sellers. One of my main concerns, and why I sold most of my BTC at over $800 was the FBI sale and the uncertainty there. Now I see that there are big whales out there looking to buy them and it will not flood the market all at once.That and MtGox being cut loose. I have no worries about the Bitcoin price going down...only up up up. Get your coins ready. Perspective: Russian News (or whatever it is called) that Max has a show on is paid for by the Russian government. It is broadcast in English to people outside of Russia and not shown in Russia.Do you think perhaps the network is set up for a specific purpose? I have a voting system set up using only Bitcoin. It is used for my BitPools site.Very close to Beta but the voting portion is quite nice. The price could easily be centralized by a few big players in such a small market.The protocol is not the market. Can't wait until you start your own exchange and implement this.Watching. Proudhon was right just like Shroedinger's cat is dead. So has anyone done what the thing is asked? If MtGox goes bankrupt...the Bitcoin trademark would be put up for sale to the highest bidder. https://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20111014.htmlTrade Mark No.   Mark Text   File Date   Status   Nice Classes   Vienna Classes   Image   Picking ListE10103646    BITCOIN    07/07/2011    Registered    09 35 38 42        No image exists for Trade Mark E10103646.    E10050466    bit coin    15/06/2011    Registered    09 38 41        Image for Trade Mark E10050466.    One is a word mark, one has an (ugly) picture.Both registered to Tribanne:Applicant:    Tibanne Co.

Didn't MtGox buy the rights to the Bitcoin trademark or something?The community seemed ok with it because they were safekeeping it from abuse by a few other people trying to get it.But with MtGox dead, they could start executing their rights to the Bitcoin name to get back money to pay for things or it could be sold in a bankruptcy court to someone who could use it to stop people from using the Bitcoin name.As much as I want MtGox to go away as a source of constant problems, it may not be the best result.Best thing would be for a competent business organization to buy them out and run things professionally.  Though a n00b, your other post called the MtGox problems before they were announced and the price crashed.Watching closely... That is the fix to the issue. The people who are panicking right now are the ones that will be complaining about how such a small amount of people own such a large amount of bitcoins.I appreciate the cheap coins though. Mt Gox is currently trading at about $140/BTC and crashing.What do you think the end of Mt Gox will look like? Obligatory:tits or gtfo I have an old device that is a mini computer that requires a fingerprint scan to activate. It plugs in to your USB and uses your computer's network and monitor/keyboard without giving access to the contents of the device.The company went out of business and the device is only compatible with old OSes. That would be ideal.
I agree, I had a dollar and went the store and was like "do you take Federal Reserve Notes?" the dude was like wtf?Personally I am putting my money into alt fiats like the Peso. People are guilty until proven innocent just for moving their money around.When moving money you have to prove that it came from a clean source and is going to a clean source. That is bullshit. I got it for just under $2k straight from Lenovo's website. I had to contact a sales person via their online chat to get the configuration I wanted (plus they had to jump through some hoops to ship to APO). I ended up ordering a Lenovo W540 with an Opal SSD encrypted hard drive which includes a CD RW drive.I will also be using it for code development so the extra power will be nice.As for the Linux and USB, I'll still be using a Windows machine for the network connected side of things. I'd use a Linux machine for that too but adding yet another laptop would be a bit much (I basically live out of my suitcase).Unfortunately the W540 isn't very light. "Underpinning the value of the dollar is a combination of (a) the fact that you can use them to pay your taxes to the U.S. government, and (b) that the Federal Reserve is a potential dollar sink and has promised to buy them back and extinguish them if their real value starts to sink at (much) more than 2%/year" -Paul KrugmanHe says it clearly that the value of the dollar is based upon the power of guns used to steal money from people and force people to use Federal Reserve Notes.But you can argue what you wish. I have bitcoins. Reality will win out over keynesian religion. Gox price to the moon.All other exchanges move a few dollars up before returning to business as usual.Gox shuts down soon thereafter. At this point, the price on Mt. Gox is so decoupled from the actual market that you may as well be watching the over/under on one of the gambling sites as an indicator of bitcoin's future price. Only via Krugman's sad arguments. He constantly refers to Bitcoin's flaw of not being backed by government/the power of guns.Any economic system can work if you force people at the point of a gun to execute it (eg Communism/slave economies).When people are free, other systems are used. And those do not involve Keynes' idea of centralized manipulation. Keynesianism relies upon the power of guns to control people. I agree that it is effective in achieving its results. Some people have the crazy notion that freedom is better than slavery. If the bitcoin price is not what you want it to be...just wait. Krugman is a Keynesian puppet and preaches that religion well.In the end, it all comes down to the idea that using the power of guns is the best way to run an economy.  Nice, I thought Gyft was only for in-person gift cards. I will definitely use it on Amazon from now on. We need more athletes in Bitcoin.Why? I have no idea. It is a group that does not have as many Bitcoin users as another group. http://www.mint.com now includes bitcoin balances but I am not sure how they are doing it. I used to use Mint.com to follow my fiat. lol I see it here and there, people mentioning the likelihood that btc-e will soon go the way of Mt. Gox. What is behind this?I pulled my LiteCoin and PPC out of there a few weeks ago. More because I did not plan to trade them anyway, just never really got around to putting the clients on my system.I also saw that over 70k of bitcoins was moved from an account I believe to belongs to btc-e. https://blockchain.info/address/1CbR8da9YPZqXJJKm9ze1GYf67eKAUfXwPSo what are the other rumors? Whenever I want to buy or sell a lot of BTC I usually use small amounts at a time, though I do it manually.If I were to sell 20 BTC at once, the price would drop as I sell and I would end up selling at low prices only to have the price climb back up to where it was.If I sell in small increments of .2, .3, etc. The order gets picked up at the current price and I can continue to do so without much affect on the price.Though I tend to try to randomize the numbers so it does not appear like it is one person selling a lot. But it would be easier to just keep repeating the same amount over and over, it likely does not matter that I randomize it.I only do big buys or sells all at once when the price is moving quickly and I want to get my orders in before a direction change. We all look back at that drop to $100 and wish we had bought at that price.The thing is, if we all had orders at those low prices it would not have dropped to $100.You missed the flash crash. Move on. Look to the current market cycle. We will likely stay i Why?Everyone has the same opportunity to get into Bitcoin. We are all individuals with our own thoughts and ideals. No need to cater to any collective. The market is already oversaturated. Practically everyone in the world now owns bitcoins. There is nowhere to go but down.
Interesting. I never thought that Mr. Gox was the kind of guy that would do that. But he could certainly do that. Bloomberg is one of the best sources for Bitcoin FUD. Yes. This documentary has been shown to be 100% scientifically accurate:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azf320JDdqU Ya, with viruses shown to be passed via USB I do not trust it since it would have to back and forth between a network connected device and the cold storage. In summary:Collectivist wants a circle jerk of friends to get along and play nice.Try moveon.org or go join a fraternity or something.Bitcoin is a currency. Not a club. Bitcoin is instantaneous. You send your bitcoins with a transaction fee and it flies through the network instantly.You confuse transactions with confirmations.Every 10 minutes the transactions are collected and added to the blockchain via mining. To reach the mathematical impossibility of a double spend most people suggest you wait 6 confirmations for full satisfaction that the transaction cannot be charged back.When you swipe your credit card, you have to wait 18 months for full satisfaction that the transaction cannot be charged back.Transaction-Bitcoin: instantCredit card: instantNo charge back-Bitcoin: 1 hourCredit card: 18 months I am looking to buy a laptop specifically for cold storage. My #1 priority is security.For this I have been looking at Lenovo laptops with Full Disk Encryption (FDE) hard drives and a CD-RW. And I want it to be light.I have looked at the Lenovo X1 which is only 3 lbs but I have not seen one with a disk drive.The reason I want a CD-RW is because I do not trust moving private keys via USB or such storage devices because of things like this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StuxnetI want it to be light because I travel and would likely keep it with me when I travel in addition to my regular Internet connected laptop.I'll be putting Linux on it so I do not care about the OS.I am hesitant to use external CD writers because I am wary of USB connected devices on a secure system.I would prefer one with good CPU and RAM because it will also be used for offline software development which I would also like to be protected.Any thoughts/suggestions? OP is a one percenter trying to keep us all in the 99%. Cannabis is the devil's weed, it will make you go crazy and kill people!This has all been scientifically documented in a movie about the reefer.Beware!!! I am still hoping for more panic.I have been buying and moving my BTC off of the exchanges once the buy goes through. Unfortunately I think we are toward the bottom, but maybe a quick panic sell if MtGox finally closes its doors will give me some more coin to sit on. Nice.Stick with your drug dealer.I mean, medical doctor. I have been both picked for jury duty and not. When I was not picked I was dropped because I expressed my honest opinion (actually got into a sort of debate with the judge).When I was picked I made sure that each of the lawyers knew that I was listening to their every word, nodding my head when needed, acting like every word that came out of their mouths was a fascinating truth. I helped to save a doctor from getting sued for malpractice when he was not guilty (swayed the jury from a knee jerk guilty verdict to not guilty). If you live near Carmel, Indiana you can now pay bitcoins for your Chiropractic care.http://www.drnancye.com/That's my sister, I helped her get things set up in her office to accept bitcoin. Unbiasedly she is one of the best Chiropractors I have been to, she specializes in children and pregnant moms but can treat anyone. I just stayed in a hotel in Dubai last night. A very nice hotel right next to the airport (Le Meridian) for about $200 for the night. Similar to prices I would pay in other large cities. Actually that hotel would be perfect for the conference, right across from the airport with about 4 different foreign restaurants on site (one being an Irish pub) with a few pools. Perhaps. But I am sure that a lot of people are holding fiat ready for that day.That was the only reason I was able to buy a bunch when it crashed. I am surprised that one long position I have lent out on BitFinex did not get squeezed out and they still hold my loan. You know those people that complain about the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer?They sell in panics too.Welcome to your first step toward joining the wealthy elite. It appears that someone dumped around 20k bitcoins all at once, probably scared that Bitcoin was broken. Or it could have easily been an early adopter with insider knowledge at MtGox who shorted just as the news came out.Speaking as someone who has been paranoid about the 25k the FBI is preparing to sell the reaction of the market gives me hope. It dropped on a 20k sell and bounced right back. That is pretty significant. It eases my worries about a 25k sale quite a bit.Plus I am glad I had a big purchase set up at around 600/BTC. I have been waiting for this opportunity. Panic is wonderful. Horrible approach.There is no need to use the government to force a company to do something it does not want to do. Bought $10k worth at $17/BTC in June 2011 before the slow decline. I did some buying and selling to get it up to 800 as the price fell below $10/BTC.Then it kept falling, my goal was 1000 BTC. So I put it all on Bitcoinica, where I could short the price. My biggest short was when it was at $4/BTC and falling, I was ready to stop the short at $3.50 but it fell to $3.60 then climbed over $4.50 squeezing me out. I lost about 300 BTC on that one short.It seemed sketchy that each of my big shorts was squeezed out just before I could make money so I pulled my 400 BTC out of Bitcoinica. A week later they were "hacked".I needed money for a downpayment on a house from every money source I could come up with in 2012 and sold it all at $11/BTC.
Anyone who buys before the lowest price is crazy and hates money. This drop is obviously because Bitcoin is broken. We will see zero within days. Wait...what is this? I have never seen this before.I have been into Bitcoin since 2010 and supported it but after this picture...wow...a new light has shown upon me.I am selling all of my bitcoins and moving on to penny stocks. I am a victim. We need a government bailout. Give me money. How is MtGox an exchange?They accept USD and bitcoins.They only pay out bitcoins (until recently).What do they do with the USD? Do they buy bitcoins on another exchange? Or...spend the USD on themselves and hope the small amount of bitcoins lasts long enough that nobody notices. Until they run out of bitcoins...and they have to make up a reason why they can no longer send bitcoins. OP fail two fiddy Probably when it is at pennies.I would buy the last coins for posterity. Damned richers. Palin makes Democrats go nuts, Hillary makes Republicans go nuts.Maybe if Palin runs the Democrats will try to run a conservative Democrat against her.Like when Hillary ran the Republicans ran a liberal Republican out of desperation. Bitcoin will dip a bit then go back up.Then crash when the FBI sells. Then go up a lot. I had around 800 once.once I think it is probably due to the amount of n00bs asking for tips all the time. People are tired of using Bitcoin because of it. I went to the teller at the bank and withdrew some money and told the teller, "ya, I need this to buy drugs". Just a chuckle and a "good luck" as she handed me my money.Should I report Chase bank? this I lost about 300 bitcoins because I thought the same thing when we were at $4/BTC and I thought it would crash to under a dollar. Shorted a lot at $4, it fell to $3.60 then jumped up to $4.50 and I got squeezed out.How many bitcoins did you lose? Long live MtGox! I got some of that sweet sweet $712 BTC If someone tells you Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme just agree with them and keep buying bitcoins before they figure out it is not. The people in the suits that write things on paper have the "right" to kidnap you because they have more guns and weapons at their disposal than you do.That is the only thing that matters.
There are already thousands upon thousands of voluntary associations. I am not trying to have a hidden meaning of turning this into something about how a government should be run. There are clubs with presidents, vice presidents, treasury, secretary, etc...committees, etc.I may be grasping, there may not be a single answer, it likely depends on the group. I was just wondering if there might be some theories out there on efficient group structures. I guess this may not have an actual answer and likely depends upon the task at hand but...What do you think is the best decision structure for a small group with a similar goal that have voluntarily joined together to fulfill that goal.Say you have 20 people that want to accomplish a real world task. They may put their money into a pot and agree on the task but then there are some day to day things that are required to make sure the task is completed. They could all vote on every decision but that would likely be very inefficient and leave most people to get tired of voting on such minor tasks.Or you could have one person in charge of the day to day types of things going to the group for only major decisions. Or a small group with an expertise elected to take on the daily tasks. Or a small group that votes for a single person, etc...There are many examples of clubs and other types of small voluntary groups with many different structures. Is there any "best structure"? Taxes are only entities of governments.Bitcoin will solve that. Did you login to bitfinex.com from your address bar or did you click on an e-mail from Bitfinex and login with your username and password? What is a Shrem T-shirt and how do I get my free one? I believe it is hovering around this price precisely because it has been at that price for a while and is now seen as "the price". So people who think the price should go down a lot when bad news hits are surprised when the price drops and people buy it up pushing the price back to 800ish. Then people are surprised when it does not skyrocket on good news when it starts going up and people start selling and shorting because they know the price will return to 800.There are two major things holding the price down. China and the FBI. Once those are out of the way it may jump again...but not until something big knocks it out of the range where people believe it will return to 800. Last time it hovered around 125 for a long time for that reason. The China exchanges knocked it up to 200, then as it started falling back down it took another jump pushing past 260 which left all thoughts of 125 behind. Just wait until February 31st. Bitcoin will end on that day. Ahh, you are correct. I had a listener watching the FBI address and I added a few other big addresses just to get a heads up for any big movements. But my e-mail said "Withdraw from FBI address".nvm Here it comes:https://blockchain.info/address/1CbR8da9YPZqXJJKm9ze1GYf67eKAUfXwPThey sent a few small transfers, most likely testing the procedure before moving all bitcoins.The question is, whether the address they moved it to is an exchange or some sort of preparation for an auction or private sale.Either way, I see a quick drop in prices soon. Then we can get back to climbing without this hanging over everyone's mind.Edit: my bad, wrong address After the Feds sell off all of their bitcoins it will skyrocket. But when they sell off the price will drop first. Are you able to withdraw to Japanese bank accounts with MtGox? This. The US government is greedy. The key to a country's hostility toward Bitcoin is how tied the central bank is tied to its government.That has a lot to do with the fact that there was no competition. Which government? "Nobel Prize Winner"stopped reading there I created my own private alt coin and moved all of my bitcoins into there because of how low Bitcoin will drop on January 31st.I have also burned down my house. Just in case. BetsofBitcoin is reliable and has been around for a while.http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532 Bloomberg is respectable? To whom?Is bitcoin a bubble? This seems like what is happening. The price has been fairly steady as bulls are holding out on big buys because of the pending Fed bitcoin sale and the bears are not selling all with the large amount of retailers coming online and Bitcoin adoption.So a steady slow decline is likely a lot of people with bitcoins buying electronics.Overstock.com was great (and also sent the price down the first day) but TigerDirect is much more relevant to Bitcoin users. I would not be surprised to see at least $2-300k in bitcoin sales the first day. That is all bitcoins being converted to dollars to pay TigerDirect.It is good for Bitcoin in the long run. It fulfills part of the chicken and egg scenario that we were always worried about in the early days. It gives more reason for people to adopt using bitcoins day by day. But in its hybrid state of converting bitcoins to dollars it will drive the price down. I tried to mine on my laptop back in 2010. I tried a few different times, each time getting errors that I could not figure out how to get it to work and not much guidance on how to get it to work on my system.Last week I got my first USB ASIC. I plugged it in and after watching a YouTube video on how to get it going I was up and running soon afterwards, now I am a bitcoin miner 3 years later.I still believe that the fact that I had to download the driver and install a miner is too much and it will eventually be plug and play (insert USB, choose pool or just give a payment address).These things are about $150 on ebay. Eventually they will be sold in Best Buy and Walmart.
Indeed. How many days is OP able to prolong this until people start trying to get him the SCAMMER label.To which he replies that his social experiment was to find out how long it would take.QEDI will end it now. OP is a scammer. Bloomberg is just trying to measure how well their smear campaign is going.It should say 47% of Bloomberg readers inundated by bad Bitcoin news are bearish on Bitcoin. Meh, without knowing the amount he has to work with $10k could be good, could be normal.On average in 2013 the price went up by 1% per day if compounded daily. So with $100k you should have $10k more in less than 10 days.There are plenty of opportunities to make decent money through several different avenues. In this environment it is easy to get a high percentage return. But you have to be ok with the risk. The price could crash while your money is in bitcoins or the price could skyrocket while you're moving fiat. If you believe that, you should bet that it will hit $10k by 2016. If it hits in 2014 you could double your BTC.Bitcoin will be worth $10,000 by 12/31/2016:http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532 Worst case scenario in the short term is that the feds sell all 170k+ on the exchanges. This would send the price down below $100/BTC briefly. With some warning the price would fall to $200-$300 beforehand, then shoot up afterwards. If they announce an auction, several big players will cash out to buy back in cheaper sending the price down beforehand, with a slow climb wondering what the buyer will do with the coins. Yes, according to the chart we should be much lower right now ($200ish), reaching $1,000 some time in October-November 2014.Certainly long term bullish but downward pressure for now. First rule of Bitcoin hacker hangout... Cool, can you just put in a bitcoin address? Oops, sorry. Wrong liberal online news site with comments.Still, congrats  I forgot to mention that I sent some earlier. I did not know we were supposed to post in here about it. This is a great site where you can set up an agent to send you an e-mail as soon as the FBI addresses move any coins.http://www.bitcoinmonitor.net/Add these two addresses:1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH, 1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX Perfect, thanks. I was thinking about creating a quick app to e-mail me if any activity happens on a certain address or addresses.Would anyone else find this useful?Has there been something created to do this already? I would be willing to take it all off of the government's hands for MUCH cheaper. Congrats on getting published in huffingtonpost. They are one of the highest read sites on the Internet. I e-mailed them about two years ago asking to be a writer for Bitcoin related articles.I often wonder if societies where sex workers are prominent have a more machismo male culture. The thinking being that the men can get their sexual needs fulfilled by sex workers and do not have to treat women as well (with the reward of sex) since that's the only way they have of getting some. Just a thought. Even with an auction that is almost 30k bitcoins that someone is buying at auction instead of going to the exchange. Why would someone do that instead of just buying on the exchange?They would only do that if they can get them cheaper at the auction. And why would someone with $25 million want to buy cheap coins? To sell them. Where do you think they would sell them?If someone with $25 million wanted to buy and hold, they would have done so by now. The FBI has been given the go ahead to sell the Silk Road bitcoins.http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January14/SilkRoadForfeiture.phpThe moment the bitcoins move out of the FBI address, what do you believe will happen to the bitcoin price?As I recall, when the FBI busted DPR for Silk Road the price dropped from $120s to $80s then climbed back up and weeks later we started the rally to the new high.I could see something like that happening again. The price will drop because of all of the new coins needing to be traded somehow for dollars. But I know that many people have probably not gone all in because they knew that would happen so many people will buy up bitcoins.And afterwards, we will not have that sale hanging over our heads so a new rally may begin.Thoughts?Selling that much on bitstamp would take it down to single digits, on MtGox down in the $400s. Hopefully they are smart about it but when have we known the US government to be smart? I figured I was a good candidate for it.I currently work in Afghanistan living in something the size of half of a truck trailer so I have some experience with living in harsh/confined spaces. My wife passed away last year and we never had any children so I will only be leaving behind family that I hardly ever see anyway.I have some experience with comms so I could be of some use with the satellite communications and the computer systems.I also have little confidence in the way the US is headed so I don't plan on returning anyway.And I would love to be involved in something as historical as being one of the first people on a planet.I was not chosen however. Perhaps because I would be around 50 by the time the flight was ready and they likely want young people who would be more physically fit. This is big, even on the biggest volume exchange that drops the price below $500/BTC. Granted this is slightly priced in so even if it goes that low many people are ready for the drop.Even if they go through a third party and try to keep it off of the exchanges, there will still need to be an exchange from dollars to bitcoins.Personally, I will be keeping an eye on that FBI address and when there is movement of coins...that is the time to take advantage. Paying taxes is certainly not voluntary. Just because slaves could run away or kill themselves to not be slaves does not mean that slavery was voluntary.You are on the wrong side of history choosing force over freedom. Just as slavery was perfectly acceptable and justified lest everyone suffer as a result.No, I do not want to pay taxes. Under threat of kidnapping I pay my taxes. I do not ask for services, I constantly vote against spending. I no longer live in the US yet I still must follow the US tax code.
When I gave one to my nephew when it was worth $45 I mentioned that the current price was $45 but I suggested he keep it for a while because I thought it would be worth around $100 within the year.My sister told me, "neat, we'll have to look into this Bitcoin thing". By Christmas the whole family was talking about the kids bitcoins. I signed up. Crowdfunding is voluntary.I understand that you probably feel that force is the best solution, you are solidly among the majority in that thought, but it does not have to be that way.  Shorting when the prices will certainly hit $5,000 by the end of the year?!?? I gave 1 Bitcoin to each of my nieces and nephews this year, fortunately the last nephew had his birthday last week so I am done for the year. When I bought the first one for $45 it wasn't that big of a deal. The last one being over $800 was a big gift.What I did was created a word document with a birthday card template with the usual birthday greeting followed byYou have 1 BitcoinPublic key:1SUSIE9sdfj033jassjelk3j3li2jndfisuosdkjasdfajPrivate key:5asdf8asdojer8ua0sd9fua0sdfa0s9dfu0a9sduf0a9sduI sent them the card and then e-mailed their parents the blockchain link pointing to their Bitcoin with a link to the blockchain wallet telling them that they can import the public and private key in order to spend the bitcoin.I also included a few links to sites where they could spend them. The term Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) has connotations that come with it that could be avoided if we just avoid using that term.How many Coke ATMs have run into regulation difficulty? When getting tokens out of a token ATM did you need to have your hand scanned?There is even a gold dispenser. No regulations necessary. It could be done. Most credit card companies allow a refund for just about any reason up to six months after purchase.So to allow bitcoin purchases with credit cards you just require a six month waiting period before you can get your bitcoins.A long time but if someone really wants bitcoins quickly, that would allow it to happen. You may want to mention that most Bitcoin mining machines have lights on them when they are mining.And with the thousands of mining machines you havea thousand points of light...New World Currencybut that probably wouldn't be prudent at this juncture In the US this is no longer true. You are taxed just for being alive.The US Supreme court has deemed ObamaCare a tax.But the OP question was "why do people think income tax is ok?".Not, "why do people think not being taxed if you work within certain criteria are ok?".As for your suggestion, I have chosen not to pay the income tax using both the "make less than the minimum" and "leave the country" options.But that does not answer the question of why being forced to give up money just because you and your employer/customer have come to a mutually agreed upon exchange of goods/services is ok.The answer you probably have on the tip of your tongue is that it is not ok to force someone to do something against their will. Lucky for you, we are forced.Would jews really go to the gas ovens if they weren't forced? Gavin, while I do not support the CFR and believe that a majority of their members support war, I will give some constructive advice.Since the subject is Bitcoin your audience is not expecting war talk like if Dick Cheney or John McCain were speaking. Most likely their concern is the US dollar as the world reserve currency. It is very vital to the US economy that the US dollar remain the world currency because that is basically all we have anymore, that and our military might.So your approach should be to explain Bitcoin, assure them that it is very unlikely to replace the dollar any time soon and emphasize that the US is currently winning against China when it comes to Bitcoin adoption and that if we want to stay the world's dominant economy we need to embrace Bitcoin and encourage its use in the US lest other countries embrace it sooner and leave the US behind.You can show some statistics showing the United States as having the most Bitcoin activity which likely means the most Bitcoin adoption which means that supporting Bitcoin in the US will keep us ahead of the Chinese who are right behind us in adoption. Here are a few links with graphs showing adoption by country:http://nikola.pekas.org/wp0/http://bitcoinstatus.rowit.co.uk/countryHosts.htmlhttp://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=how%20buy%20bitcoins (Google trends: how buy bitcoins)CFR folks will eat up a US vs China argument and want to beat the Chinese, even in Bitcoin use. We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.The End Yes, because clothes are a fundamental part of the economy. If people do not have clothes, nobody will go to work, people could get hypothermia and that puts a burden on the health care which is paid for by taxes. Nobody would go out and spend money which would destroy the retail industries.Basically clothes are needed for an economy to exist.Whenever someone gets the crazy idea of getting rid of taxes the first thing to come up is "what about the clothes?". Because only government can provide clothes. Imagine if corporations were in charge of clothes. We would all be at their mercy. A company could buy all of the clothes stores around you and refuse to let you buy from them, then you would be stuck at home, naked. What if people cannot afford clothes for work? How would they be able to go out and get a job with no clothes in the first place? If you think clothes should be privatized you obviously hate the poor and the children and want them to be naked. Which also makes you a pedophile, you sick bastard.If you do not like taxes then you are a pedophile. Garbage service, TV, fire departments, food, clothing, electricity. Over 300,000 hotels available for booking at http://www.simplytravelonline.com/ I also heard that Kim Jong has hoofs and horns and sucks people's blood at night.The extent the media goes to portray someone as the embodiment of evil in preparation for war is so lame. Yet people gobble it up like it's truth without question.The media has become a parody of itself. Correct.Think of Bitcoin as a ledger of accounts with balances.The blockchain contains your account (public key) and the balance for that account.To spend money from your account you need your password (private key).Bitcoin splits your bitcoins into several accounts (public keys).Your wallet is merely a list of your public keys with their associated private keys.Just like having a file on your computer with a list of login names and passwords for all of your bank accounts. Anyone who has that list can log into your online bank account and move money. Not sure what the investment structure is but http://www.friendswithcoins.com needs to go mainstream.A sort of localbitcoins trading online with your Facebook friends. This.Bank spends $20 million, destroys Bitcoin. People change their code slightly, now using LiteCoin.Bank spends $20 million, destroys Litecoin. People change their code slightly to PPC.Same thing happens, by now the code change is just the click of a button, points to the next crypto-currency.Meanwhile, bank is spending a lot of money on something that does not increase their revenue.Change that from bank to government...after enough money spent, it takes a toll on their economy. If it is a government where the people have a say, there would be protests about their foolish spending to attack something that hurts nobody.
Give it a try and get back to us when you get your fiat back.See you again in a few months. Who calls themselves libertarian but want free healthcare and government to pay the poor? Example please. Better than links. A picture speaks a thousand words (or two): He who dies with the most bitcoins, wins. We will likely go below $10/BTC this weekend because of the bad news and stuff and things.So you should sell as much as you can as soon as possible.This is not a ploy to get your cheap coins when I get paid tomorrow. Honest. I have no idea why people would vote for bit when it is commonly known as an eighth of something..0001 is not an eighth. Bitcoin needs a small self contained solar unit that acts as a miner and a wireless relay that can be placed atop telephone poles and high up in trees.Make it so. This is similar to BitPools (in my signature).Person A has an idea. They create a Pool with that idea (a forum is created, etc).People who support the idea join the pool (by pledging some BTC).Anyone (or just people in the pool) creates a proposal.If the members like the proposal they vote for it.If it meets a certain threshold, the proposal passes and the pledged BTC is sent to the proposer to go ahead and fulfill their end of it.An over-simplified version but you get the point.My current goal is to be ready in February with the site. Not to worry, I ordered an ASIC USB drive on ebay and it should be here soon. So I will likely tip all of the mining power on its ear once I plug it in. I promise if I go over 50% with it I will not double spend.Crisis averted.  Communist/Fascist/Totalitarian. Hell ya! Believe it!Or go to jail. If they did, there would be no way to defend myself. The IRS has more power than any small group of Somalis.You can defend yourself from Somali pirates. It will be years before the case is over. But carbon credits allow rich companies to pay governments to allow them to pollute the world. Kinda like how companies pay the EPA to allow them to pollute.Both are highly defended by environmental/socialists.  Hmm, a group using guns to try to take money from people.In Somalia you can use your guns to defend yourself from such people.In the US you get called a tax protester and are thrown in jail. Could Bitcoin be used for Carbon credits?I know carbon credits are silly and a way for Al Gore to make money so I would rather such a silly idea not have scammers taking money from a stupid scam.So why not use the blockchain?People who are a carbon sink can prove to their government how much carbon they are pulling from the environment and they will get in return a bitcoin address per pound or square foot or whatever the measurement is.People who pollute can go to their government and are given empty addresses to fill per pound or whichever. Just fill them on a first come first served basis.Then the government sanctioned polluting can commence and environmentalists will be happy about it. Economically I would say Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, Cook Islands..Socially Costa Rica, Amsterdam...Both, Somalia.Somalia is a good demonstration of how the rest of the world treats free countries. Their economy has improved dramatically ever since their government failed. But every country out there believes it is their duty to "fix" Somalia making more and more problems as they have to fight the invaders. But Donald Trump should be able to decide what his $10 million goes toward. See the link in my signature. I am working on a voting system using Bitcoin.I think the idea of one person one vote is a bit old fashioned so I do not see much point in it.But if it was something that was needed, instead of people getting private addresses from the government they would register their public address when they go to vote. Only those addresses listed would be counted.I am not sure how you would prevent people paying for votes though. That is why I believe your "vote" should be tied to your monetary contribution to the "government". Based on the story of the shepherd being outside with his flock they put September as a more likely time of the real Christmas.
Better cheap labor locally than outsourcing. Login works for me. I have set up a BitPay account and it is SO easy...but if you do not want to go that route I think you can send it to them via CoinBase. I have sent bitcoins to family members by just sending it to their e-mail address. I am not sure what it looks like on their end though. There would be a huge amount of cheap labor. I said anyone can come in.The only cost would be citizenship. Citizenship could entail things such as paying for education, social security, ability to own property, business benefits, etc... Taking into account compounding interest 2013 would have given you an average of 1% per day by just buying and holding bitcoin. Do not invest in bitcoin.Convert to them. I use Bitronic Tech as my web hosting service, they accept Bitcoin for payment. They charge me around $50 per month for my service. I like paying with Bitcoin because when Bitcoin shoots up really high, instead of selling I just pay my monthly bill. And when the price drops, I buy more. Sure the price could keep climbing through the roof, that just means next month's bill will be even cheaper.Either way, it is better than buying Federal Reserve Notes with my bitcoins. The Roth IRA will be taxed by the time you retire if the US is still a country. If the US is still a country your Roth will be denominated in worthless Federal Reserve Notes.Get away from any investment that leaves you holding Federal Reserve Notes other than using them as wallpaper or fire starter. We did, some poor soul sold me coins for $420/BTC. Most pay very very few microcoins. I would say that anyone can come in.But to be a citizen you have to pay a one time fee.That fee should be the only income needed by the government.If the fee is too high, less people will immigrate. If the fee is low, more people will immigrate.If the government spends wisely and is a good government they will get people willing to pay. If they suck, nobody will want to come to the country.I say a one time fee because that way you know what you are getting when you pay. Facebook has no inherent value. The only way Facebook has value is if people accept it as a way to interact with others. It is just a bunch of ones and zeros that cannot be used as jewelry and is not backed by the full faith and credit of the government.Yet it has value because people use it, it has reached the point where the network effect has created such value.If Bitcoin were to have as many users as Facebook the value would certainly be justified. But Facebook is a social tool, Bitcoin is a currency which has more economic value so it would likely be worth much more with the same amount of users. So...we are in the middle of the upswings...when we could buy cheap coins? Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, Bermuda, etc...In what sick socialist world do you live in where all of those things paid for by tax dollars? I would not denominate in some non-Bitcoin term any denomination for Bitcoin other than the Satoshi (since by the time we get to pricing things in Satoshis people should know that is the denomination by then).Bitcoin is a brand, part of its value is that the word Bitcoin is so well known and associated with crypto-currency.To come up with another word for talking about bitcoins would be the equivalent to starting another alt currency with your new name.mBTC or milli-Bitcoin is easily known as .001 bitcoins because enough people can recognize what milli stands for (even Americans know what a millimeter is).I will be using mBTC on my website as it makes sense. Is it even likely that the US will have any money to spend on such research in the next 20 years? I used to work for IBM. They do not do much development anymore, they are now a "services company". This means that they would be able to help businesses to create innovation with Bitcoin but they will not be leading the effort. Over the next month we will fluctuate between 600 and 900. Maybe a few exchanges going briefly above or below. I am fine with voluntary communism in things such as communes and community property. It is when force comes into the equation that it becomes perverted. In every election anything can pop up as an issue that nobody can predict. If the issue gets enough press both candidates will polarize and take extreme positions on it as they milk the free press coverage. Bitcoin could pop up at some point during the election season.I can see at least one candidate being quoted as being supportive of Bitcoin followed by his opponent attacking him with the usual attacks we see all the time about Bitcoin. He supports drug users, pedophiles, money laundering, terrorists, etc.Depending on the outcome other candidates will either show their support or stay away from the issue needing "time to look into it".Knowing how closely the Federal Reserve gets involved in US politics (see Ron Paul's End the Fed attacks) I do not see Bitcoin doing very well "politically" this election season. It is still too young and the banks are much more powerful. Though I do not see it as having much impact on Bitcoin itself, just on how politicians approach it.
That would give Bitcoin inherent value.Kinda like gold can also be used for jewelry and electronics, the more other things that Bitcoin can be used for, the more inherent value it gains. Newbs that want to easily get into Bitcoin for the first time just so they can say they have some bitcoins.Or investors that see the price drop but do not have liquid cash in a place where they can take advantage of the good deal.Remember, CoinBase does not allow you to spend for 1 month after your first purchase. Accept Credit Card payments for bitcoins.The buyer would get their bitcoins at the price at the time of purchase, but they could not spend them until 6 months have passed (the time needed to avoid chargebacks). Oh, that was me...I bought 3 pizzas for New Year's and left a nice tip. Very nice This is something Friends With Coins will solve (http://www.friendswithcoins.com).You will be able to find a Facebook friend and buy from them with PayPal. If your friend screws you you can let everyone know it, his family will see it, his friends see it...it would be very unlikely that your friend would screw you over. Bloomberg and BusinessInsider are sources of FUD.Most likely they are so invested in the big business/big government marriage that they are merely mouth pieces for those groups. How far we have come from a year ago.  Year high, just over $5k. I finally ordered my first ASIC miner.I tried mining back in 2010 and couldn't get it working. A simple to use device I can plug in that does the mining with minimum effort allows me to finally count myself among the miners.I suspect that as these simple devices become more mass produced mining will become a lot more widespread. I used to use BitSpend for all of my online shopping. Hopefully Overstock.com will allow me to purchase more things online with bitcoins. It was sort of priced in before the halving but I believe that it contributed to the climb that started in January. Actually, the day that this thread went up (or the next day) I was able to get a bunch of coins for around $420 on BitFinex. So you were close to calling the bottom. Keynesians/socialists do not understand progress. Their ideal world would have all innovators and people who bring the economy forward just stop and allow the workers to just keep doing what they are currently doing and share the wealth instead of the wealth going toward moving forward.They pray that new technology fails to achieve their goal of everyone living in a stagnant world so that their economics can finally work. Another thing to look for in an article is if someone calls it "bit coin" or when they speak of Satoshi they say it could be a group of people (some people cannot fathom an individual being able to create something so big). Actually a lot of focus on Satoshi as opposed to Bitcoin itself usually shows that the writer has no clue. In all honesty, the best thing to do is buy.Stability fuels the rocket. Next Saturday.You can quote me on that. It would be more wise for those who are taking earnings out throughout 2014 to take it out steadily throughout the year.To take it out on January 1 when the price could jump 10x (as it has done most years) by 2015 would be foolish. Not the same thing but there is a new Bitcoin exchange being started using Facebook as a way of trading among friends.http://www.friendswithcoins.com That would be great...I can buy more at the beginning of 2014 and watch it grow throughout the year.I suspect though that most people who pull out fiat for the next tax season will do so when they need the money such as buying a new vehicle or putting a down payment on a house. It will not all happen at once.
A country like the Bahamas or the Caymans has no capital gains taxes, so they would be able to convert from bitcoins to fiat without a tax liability if I am not mistaken. This game is very fun, I played it a lot in Beta.https://www.bitfantasy.com/It is an RPG that lets you buy items from the stores using bitcoins. You can also sell things to other players in bitcoins. Or you can just play the game without using bitcoins.  So the bank of India has the power to arrest people?The central bank of the US only has the power to start wars and choose our leaders but even they cannot arrest people...yet. Let us say that someone has made a lot of money investing in bitcoins. Could they set up a company in a foreign country with no capital gains or income tax, loan the company some bitcoin to get going. Then draw a foreign income from that company.If they live outside of the US for more than 330 days and earn all of that income while away they would qualify for the foreign income exclusion which is around $96k.Would they be able to turn their bitcoin profits into fiat income up to $96k and not pay income taxes? Not on a military base on a military network that monitors me more than the NSA monitors US citizens. I work in Afghanistan as a military contractor. I make a lot of money with no expenses (my house back home is being rented for the amount of the mortgage payment).Every paycheck gets converted to bitcoins. If you believe Bitcoin will reach $10,000 by 2016 drop a few mBTC here and double your investment when it does:http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532 Buy until you have 2.1 bitcoins, then put those in cold storage so you own one out of 10 million bitcoins that will ever exist. It will grow slowly for sure. But it will grow in a way that separates Bitcoin from the government currency.We have people paying with btc for goods here which are then converted to dollars for most of the sites using something like BitPay. Sure it helps to grow the economy faster, but we still have to work toward having a bitcoin to bitcoin economy. In a way the Chinese are lucky that they are not in an environment of hybrid payment systems. Their Bitcoin economy will grow on a bitcoin to bitcoin basis instead of a bitcoin to bitcoin converted to government money basis. I sold a bitcoin to my buddy, he paid me using PayPal because it was the easiest for him. February - The ability to vote using Bitcoin will be available to groups that want it It was on Bloomberg. As much as they like to attack Bitcoin they should have kept the money. A lot of references to "we" on a website that is a single page of basic HTML. How many people were on the huge team? How many weeks did the team work to get that site up and running? Are they all getting proper health insurance and taxes being taken out of their paychecks for such a huge undertaking? Something is happening here. Seems legit. I agree, it helps that people will have a friend who will be people's "online Bitcoin consultants" to help them through the whole process.A lot of people do not know anything about Bitcoin but know enough that they want some. Going through a friend is how most people get started. I have sold to friends and just e-mailed them their public/private keys and they sent me money via PayPal. Not the best way to do it, but it works. Though private keys in e-mail is pretty unsecure as well. I then told them how to download a wallet and move it to their wallet. Buy from Facebook? Facebook hacking?The only interaction with Facebook is a list of people's friends and posts to the wall. Hack Facebook all you want, the seller still has to recognize the buyer as one of their friends before sending any bitcoin.Or don't sell to someone you don't trust. Do you people have a bunch of scammer friends or something? So this site http://www.friendswithcoins.com/ is working on facilitating people buying bitcoins through their Facebook friends. Purchases posted on people's walls giving Bitcoin a lot more exposure with the ability for people to easily buy bitcoins from their friends (using things like PayPal or other simple pay services).This could drive the Bitcoin price up quite a bit if people start seeing a lot of their friends buying bitcoins and decide to jump in.It would be legal for Chinese people to buy from their friends through something like alipay (China's version of PayPal with over 550 million people).With over a billion Facebook users all over the world this could tap a huge market of online users even bigger than China. This type of setup will open up a lot more people to Bitcoin. People who barely know anything about Bitcoin but want to get a few.We need to take baby steps and hand hold through the process. Getting people a few mBTC first is a good start, then they can withdraw to their client once they learn about how to keep their coins secure.The web wallet also helps with an escrow portion of the trade.Friends With Coins is a great way to expose people to Bitcoin. People will see a post on your wall about buying or selling bitcoins and start asking questions, and if they see it on enough of their friend's walls they'll want to try it out. This is the word of mouth type of viral growth that can put bitcoin into a lot of people's hands.Facebook is worldwide, even in China. This will be a way that people in China can get bitcoins within the law through something like alipay which is like China's PayPal with over 550 million users.
2.1 or 21 if you can afford it.21 bitcoins means that you will have one millionth of all bitcoins ever created (2.1 means one ten millionth).So less than a million people could ever have more bitcoins than you.At 2100 bitcoins (the Vladmir club) there could only be less than 10,000 people with more bitcoins than you. Awesome, do I have a bunch of options to choose from to meet my own needs as I choose? It will be hard to compete with all of those college educated immigrants who speak great English.Oh well, it was nice while I had a job. I wasted all of that time and money on that Master's degree for nothing. I did already. The old high of .669 is long gone. Good idea, always good to panic and sell low. I use my bank accounts to receive my paycheck and pay my mortgage. The rest I send to the exchange to convert to real money.  Nano technology combined with drones.Tiny Bitcoins flying all over the place? I don't. But Keynes thinks we should all lose wealth to big corporations that have first dibs on new money before it loses value. I did Fortunately I pulled out the rest of my BTC about a week before Bitcoinica stole everyone's money. You mean the risk of the bank taking all of your fiat (especially the ones that like to freeze Bitcoin users accounts)?Or the risk of the dollar collapsing? You know...that whole $20 trillion debt and QE infinity...Maximize profit? The value of Bitcoin has gone up by at least 1000% yearly...I would hate to be stuck with fiat. Maybe Keynes was right?Perhaps a currency that loses value is better? I have a buying opportunity every time I get paid in fiat.I made the mistake of shorting at $4 thinking it would go down to $3.50. I got short squeezed as it went down to $3.60 then climbed and climbed and climbed...Now I just get what Bitcoin I can, when I can. I prefer to have all of my money safe, so I feel a lot safer when I cash out all of my money into cold storage. I cashed out most of my fiat since this downturn.I still have about 10% fiat that I need to cash out so I can walk away and come back later. How does something that already popped pop?Or is the price at $1244 on an exchange I do not know about? I agree, if all of these global warming nuts focused on making green products better and more cost effective than regular products their self interests may just get accomplished.Instead they tend to push the government to just stand in the way of progress in the most inefficient way possible against their own interests. The only question that needs to be asked is why is it now referred to as "climate change" instead of "global warming"?Not too confident that the globe is warming? Have to hedge your bets in case of global cooling? They will be doubling everyone's bitcoins on the blockchain!We will all be rich!
http://www.seasteading.orghttp://www.seasteading.orghttp://www.seasteading.orgEverything has already been addressed. True, which is probably why the whole thing could be summarized by saying "Bitcoin does poorly as an online version of a brick and mortar bank" Seriously? Turning this into a "I hate ASICs" thread?ASICs which are being mass produced to the point where any person can buy a small device and be up and mining quickly.When I tried mining for the first time in 2010 I could not get it running on my computer for whatever reason, if I had a device to plug into my computer that did it for me I would have been mining way back then. "I was previously CTO at online banking service" Keynsian banker does not like Bitcoin. Criticizes all of the lack of keynsian banking provided by Bitcoin. In 2007 Ron Paul was running for president. Once people found out about Ron Paul they went out of their way to get him elected in an environment of big government politics.The media ignored him, they went out of their way to exclude anything Ron Paul related. Then his supporters found out that the media liked to report the results of the quarterly donation figures. His supporters figured that there was no way they would ignore Ron Paul getting a large amount of donations.So in the spirit of "V for Vendetta" his supporters got behind a November 5th money bomb where the goal was to raise as much money toward Ron Paul's campaign on November 5th as possible. They ended up raising over a million dollars in a day. The media reported the heck out of it, Ron Paul was finally being covered on TV instead of just on the Internet.So the plan shortly after that was to do another one, there was a quick second one set for Nov. 11, Veteran's Day, a few other days were considered but everyone liked the idea of having the next money bomb day as December 16, the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party.Not only did they plan a Tea Party money bomb, they included parades all over the country, rallies, all sorts of big events to support Ron Paul. On that day Ron Paul collected over $6 million in donations. There were rallies all over the country ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRLqwPQQuo ), there was a lot of media attention and the Tea Party was born.After the Republicans gave the election to Obama by electing a liberal in the primaries the Tea Party rallies continued. The same people that elected a liberal started joining the rallies because they were upset that their liberal was not elected.The message started getting muddied by the same big government supporters that were the reason for the Tea Party in the first place. It was easily attacked because the same old arguments could be used against the same old politics. And it turned into the same old big government politics with people like Marco Rubio using the Tea Party enthusiasm to get elected so he could support big government.Bitcoin has grown from its supporters who understand the whole point of Bitcoin, have read the White Paper and agree with the sentiment behind Satoshi's words about the bailouts and the need for a new currency outside of the Federal Reserve.Bitcoin is growing but it is gaining people who have no real clue about the concept, they just see it as an investment, a fad to put their money in so they can get some good fiat out of it. People can easily attack Bitcoin because of these investors, attacking the "bubble" and fad-like support. Government support is becoming the centerpiece, there is a Bitcoin Foundation to centralize Bitcoin decisions.Will Bitcoin become muddied by the same big government supporters that were the reason for Bitcoin in the first place? Yep, that estimate was based upon this:But the tip didn't happen, we got this: Sell? I only spend bitcoins. What is it? 1% of Bitcoin owners own 75% of Bitcoin or something like that?Well, are you giving them a bigger share or taking from them at these low prices?Will you continue to complain about them when we are at $10k/bitcoin when you had a chance to remedy it? Having more BTC is all that matters. Already did, hope it drops more so I can buy more.Buy/Sell   Fees   Price Per Coin   Status   DateBuy   10,154.59 USD       18.00 BTC   100.69 USD   558.55 USD   PENDING   Dec 18, 2013 Bloomberg and BusinessInsider are great sources of FUD against Bitcoin.When people over-react to the news from these sites and drop the price, you can get a lot of cheap coins before more reputable news sources start dissecting the information and show how full of it they are.It has been fairly consistent for a few months so use this info as you please. Thank you all for the FUD!I have been buying so many cheap coins.Almost 100% BTC now.So relieved to be back to a price where I can get rid of the useless fiat. Everyone was fighting to become the one to pop the bubble in the media. If it was not China it would people saying "I'm sure the news of Bernanke calling Bitcoin a bubble was planned exactly to come out at the right time to make the chart resemble the one from April."People knew the price would drop, everyone was sitting next to the sell key trying to time the top. China was used as a catalyst this time. Last time it was because MtGox was lagged.And the China news is not really that big of a deal, if that were mentioned in the middle of the summer when prices were stable, nobody would have really cared at all.Half of the crap being posted is false panic to prey on people's emotions with such an emotional price hike. If the price drops again that would be great. The whole point is to get as many bitcoins as possible.After the last drop I gained a bunch from people who do not want to take part in the new economy. I bought 10 million bitcoins due to this latest scoop. I hope that speculating based upon a rumor is a smart move. The last bubble:We missed the big spike, but does this look familiar?So...what happened after that last time we were here? I almost feel bad for the people who sold me their cheap coins at less than $700.I guess I should have advised them that selling at such a low price was a bad move but instead I took advantage of them and took their bitcoins away from them.Was I wrong? Let me know if you were one of the ones who sold under $700 and maybe I can help you through your poor decision making. Best time to sell is now after the price has dropped.Wait to buy in again after everyone else has bought.Buy high, sell low. This is the stable price. Buy on panics and bad news.The only reason to ever sell is if Bitcoin itself is broke.And Bitcoin will not break.
Why would I buy fiat? This has all been covered by the Seasteading group.You cannot build anything within 200 miles of any nation, everything else is in deep sea which cannot anchor.Any structure has to deal with 100 meter waves.BlueSeed is a test of the seasteading idea of many people living in an ocean vessel but it will still be registered to a nation, most likely the bahamas.The Seasteading Institute has done several studies, the last one is one choosing a nation to support a trial run in their waters, that study will be out soon.But there is another option that is already in the works.Alderneyhttp://www.coindesk.com/british-island-physical-bitcoins-uk-royal-mint/A british island nation that has control over minting their own currency is seriously considering using Bitcoin as their official currency.They would actually mint a physical currency backed by Bitcoin like how the US dollar used to be backed by gold. You will be able to take your currency to the mint and exchange it for Bitcoin if you wish. They got rid of poll taxes quite a while ago:24th Amendment:The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax. After several arguments about the Constitutionality of the income tax the pro-tax people always point to the 16th Amendment, the government has power to lay taxes upon any income...But in order for ObamaCare to make it through the Supreme Court they had to call it a tax.But if you have no income, what is taxed? And how is it Constitutional? Casascius has outlived its original intention. It was great as a novelty when Bitcoin was at $5 and they could be used as a great marketing tool. But with their high price and the ability to break the seal without being detected as well as the counterfeiting that was starting to happen they were beyond their usefulness as anything other than a trinket.Though if he wishes to continue he can always leave such a business unfriendly country and run his business somewhere else. In all honesty, PayPal is a good thing. It was a revolutionary way of sending money over the Internet which is badly needed and helped to improve commerce online for millions of people.But it was a transitional solution which required a central company to work on it in order to take it through the baby steps in the beginning to the point where people are comfortable with sending money online today.Bitcoin improves upon this idea and takes away the overhead and complication of a central solution and distributes it. This allows for the added benefits that Bitcoin provides in an environment where online transactions are the norm without the need to completely revolutionize the way people think about spending money. Yes, Canada is a person. Only 2 people max can own half of all bitcoins. Buy when everyone else is in a "in a well thought out panic". People do not make enough money and then stop. That is not how life works. I respect socialists and communists who actually have principles as opposed to Republicans and Democrats who's ideas come from others telling them what they should believe because of who they are.I especially respect those that would be ok with my community of free thinkers living next to theirs without the need to try to regulate us "for our own good". How libertarians see those who like to take away freedom from people: Time travel is useless without teleportation.Say I want to go one day into the future at this exact location.Poof, I am one day in the future.Argh! I am in the middle of space, Earth has traveled thousands of kilometers away...I am dead. I make good money on this volatility.I will look back on these days of volatility as the "good ol' days". Buy 1.8 more bitcoins at any price.Put the 2.1 bitcoins into as cold a storage device as you can come up with. Know that there will never be more than 10 million people with more money than you.Use the other bitcoin to spend as needed. If this follows the same slide as the March bubble pop it will go down to around $300 before going back up to around $400. I went to a Chinese restaurant and when the check came I pulled out my phone told them I was going to pay with Bitcoin. They said no. I told them it was all I had. They called the cops.Conclusion. Bitcoin is banned in China. Try to use it and you will be thrown in jail. I have not lost any coins.This lower price has opened the floodgates for being able to buy more coins. It sucked having so many paychecks sitting in fiat waiting for people to sell low. Why not stop using fiat to buy/sell bitcoin and work on a business where you can make Bitcoin so you do not have to pay so much attention to the price. n00bs buying fiat
Most people selling now are not selling to buy fiat.They are selling so that they can buy bitcoins cheaper. What's that? BTC China trading isn't illegal? So everything is the exact same as before?But...the Keynsians in the media are saying scary words like Bitcoin banned in China...Please do not crush my whole world view and tell me that the media is a bunch of idiots that like to deceive so that they can all laugh about how they are helping to enlighten the plebes when they are at their dinner parties. That little dip felt a lot like the dip we had when it went from $900 to $500 before evening out around $800 for a few days.From there it climbed quite a bit.$1,600 by the end of the year is very possible. My car is like red tulips.My car is red. I appreciate all of the responses. I may have to just take a year and just stay in different locations for a month or so at a time. Most countries allow you to stay there for a month on a tourist visa. How do you vote with tulips?Or implement contracts? I have never heard this analogy with tulip mania before. Please indulge us all. I see it not just as an advancement of the financial system but economic/political systems as well.I see Bitcoin as a way to usher in a progression as significant as going from kingdoms to democracies. That would be around 10% of all known physical currency in circulation. The fair price of Bitcoin is zero dollars.Because eventually there will be no more dollar, but there will be bitcoins. With each new country getting their own exchange the price will go up.A big one few people think about is Africa.The fact that M-Pesa is so popular and they are used to paying for things with their cell phones makes it a simple transition. 10% in the Bitcoin world is quite easy, of course you obviously want more than that or you would not be doing this.I have quite a bit invested and can give you a few pointers via PM, though I greedily do not really want someone with a million dollars making money the way I am. But for sure, going via CoinBase is not the best route. They are good for convenience, not for investing large amounts.When it comes to not paying taxes, there are legal ways of doing so. But I agree with others that your story does not seem legit. There are many legal and tax issues that your dad has to cover just to give you that much money, and if you do not pay him back it is not just him you have to worry about but also the IRS. Moving that much money around is not like in the movies. Why do you all want to take away money from the government?hehya guys, why do you want to take away all of government's money?bunch of thieves stealing from the poor defenseless government Bah, my phone sucks. I could not verify to log into my account on CoinBase.I will have to hope I wake up tomorrow to a bunch of scared weak hands so I can get in cheaper.You should all sell. Anything over $5/BTC is overpriced. Tulips, ponzi, pyramid, bubble! Buy on panic.Damned CoinBase...by the time my phone charges to verify my account the dip will be bought up. Best time we have had to buy in a long time. Edit: added chart to show the reason for the post, no matter the price, if it drops over 40% within an hour...buying is probably a wise decisionthe price dropped again a few days later but hovered around $1000 for the next few months*and, not that it matters, but I did not buy until a few hours after this post so it was not a "pump" to make me money* tulips are a ponzi scheme in the form of pyramid bubbles  Stock split!

Please read the Bitcoin white paper before acting like this has not been considered from the beginning. 42 My low amount that I will sell are 21000000.00 coins (with the decimal moved to the left quite a few). Wait for me to move some BTC for you to borrow at a high percentage before you do.Though the fact that the return is usually only around 2% APY means that hardly anyone ever shorts.For good reason.MtGox at $1140 now. Ya, it is looking like $1,100 is the new $800. We have been in this range for several days. I currently work on a military base in Afghanistan. My food and housing is provided and I have no expenses other than a $99 storage fee back home.For most of the year I have been transferring my full paycheck directly to Dwolla which I then moved right to CampBx which I then converted to Bitcoin.Though when Dwolla stopped working with CampBx I have been stuck with these Federal Reserve Notes accumulating in my bank account. I do not like my fiat just sitting there in a bank losing value. Plus I am vulnerable to the bank freezing my account or doing whatever they want with my money as any third party site is able to do.I enjoy having my funds safely locked in cold storage where nobody can get to my funds without my consent.I am currently at around 10:1 BTC:fiat and hope to remedy that with around 500:1 (enough for my storage unit and little stuff) BTC:fiat when I am able to get my funds into Bitcoin. I am so disappointed by the amount of people who replied to this thread who did not give the obvious answer by Satoshi himself when he created Bitcoin addressing this very issue.I invite all readers and posters of this thread to read about this thing called Bitcoin:http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf Alex Jones is COIntelProhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGRVqIz9ko'nuff said +1Imagine your buddies take you to Vegas and your best buddy hires a dominatrix for you and she ties you up to the bed and repeatedly punches you in the balls. He pays her $200 from your wallet and expects you to thank him for the hook up.All of that stuff you said about what the government provides. Ya, we do not want those things. We repeatedly say we do not want it. We talk all the time about how much we do not want these government services over and over and over and over.But you go ahead and vote for people who provide it, then you tell us that we are hypocrites for living in this society that provides all of this bullshit when we complain about being robbed to get punched in the nuts.  I noticed this. Going some place to just work on the Internet does not really fall into a typical immigration scenario.Most countries are expecting people who are old enough to retire, or someone who is going to work in that country. Some people are not big fans of being robbed.Now we are robbed in the US just for being alive thanks to Obamacare.Such ancient ideas of running things. I do not plan on renouncing my citizenship. I still ignorantly hold out some hope that the people may come to their senses. I looked at Thailand, I only looked briefly but the rental prices were not much different from my home town $600-$1200/month on average. Though I was looking on craigslist in English which likely preys on Americans. When I leave Afghanistan I will likely be leaving my steady job and working on Bitcoin projects full time. But I do not plan on living in the US after I return.Ideally I would like a place where I can just live in a small place on a beach with Internet connection for a few hundred bucks a month.I'm even fine with just being international and living in a new place every 6 months or so.Or maybe even a Bitcoin hub like silicon valley for Bitcoin (I know Berlin has a lot of buzz, that is certainly an option). The bible says not to use government currency.Mark 12:16"Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at." They brought one. And He said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" And they said to Him, "Caesar's." And Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." Modern day:"Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a dollar to look at." They brought one. And He said to them, "Whose name is this?" And they said to Him, "Federal Reserve's." And Jesus said to them, "Render to the Federal Reserve the things that are the Federal Reserve's, and to God the things that are God's." You should not keep your coins at any third company site. Other than what you may want to spend that day. "FATCA requires foreign financial institutions (FFI) of broad scope  banks, stock brokers, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, trusts  to report directly to the IRS all clients who are U.S. Persons. Starting January 1, 2013 (later delayed to 2014), FATCA will require FFIs to provide annual reports to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the name and address of each U.S. client, as well as the largest account balance in the year and total debits and credits of any account owned by a U.S. person. If an institution does not comply, the U.S. will impose a 30% withholding tax on all its transactions concerning U.S. securities, including the proceeds of sale of securities." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven#cite_note-53It's already going into affect in the Caymen Islands, Panama, Costa Rica and pretty much every tax haven country that used to exist. Doesn't work if you're an American citizen. The biggest problem there is the amount of taxes you would have to pay if you took out $1 million. I can't wait for the value of the dollar to go down so much that I can wallpaper my house with benjamins.In reality, Bitcoin will do better with a good economy which will promote advances in technology which will make Bitcoin a more viable currency to use on a day to day basis. Interesting, either way I would move to any country and start my business if they started using Bitcoin for their currency. (if they were open to people living in their country)
But a physical coin has not yet been perfected.Every time it changes hands it needs to be cashed out and discarded. I submitted the bet earlier in the year when we reached around $100/BTC.I figured we were hitting a 10X price increase per year so I figured we would hit $1,000/BTC some time in 2014 and hopefully $10,000 some time in 2015. I added a year to hedge against a slow year.The bet does not need to go until 2016 if we reach $10,000/BTC then the bet ends. I would say that the only person who pledged to any of the assassinations is the owner of the site himself.The biggest pledge is for Ben Bernanke...the guy who is not even the Federal Reserve Chairman any more.That many people could not be that stupid. My friends were telling me to sell at $70. 1 Bitcoin will be worth at least $10,000 by 12/31/2016Success of this bet will occur if 1 Bitcoin is valued at $10,000 or more on one of the largest exchanges of the time (based upon top 4 trading volumes/day). The $10,000 is in Federal Reserve Notes (US dollars).InfoOpening date: April 14, 2013Bet deadline: Dec. 3, 2016 end of day Eastern TimeEvent date: Dec. 31, 2016 end of day Eastern TimeCategory: EconomicsTotal agree bets: 0.90Total disagree bets: 0.90Total weighted agree bets: 27663.920Total weighted disagree bets: 28514.809http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=15321 to 1 bet right now, put your bet in to double your bitcoins when it reaches $10k During the last bubble in March I bought LTC and PPC just to diversify and hedge my BTC a little bit. The Bitcoin price was so high that I was not comfortable buying at such a high price but I did not want my money in dollars. I sold a good chunk of my BTC and have around $30k sitting in my bank account so I would love for the price to plunge.But I think we are at a sustainable level. Those that wanted to sell at $1,000 have probably already cashed out by now as it is likely close enough for most people. I do not believe we will go over $1,000 for the moment, we would need momentum to take us over that price point and we no longer have it. A week ago I believed we would shoot up past $1,000 to new territory but even then I believed we would fall back to around this price, right below $1,000.But...the price does like to drop on bad news. When Silk Road went down the price crashed (before bouncing right back).So if you are looking to buy back in, make sure you have some buy orders in the $600 and $700 range because a quick reaction to some bad news may create a quick fear sell. But it will be short lived (when the price was sitting at $120 for a long time I had a bunch of buys going all the way down to $82, the price dropped to my bid of $93 before returning up). Though the money I had in the 80s waiting to buy would have done better at $120 than at $500 when I finally made use of those funds. You could take all the wealth in the world and distribute it evenly to everyone in the world.Within 20 years it would be right back to how it was before. I have read a lot by Peter Schiff and he makes a good case against fiat currencies and especially the US dollar in his writings.I have been against fiat for a while and also believed that the solution was in owning gold and I searched and searched for a way to have my spendable money in gold as it would not suffer the loss of value that fiat does.However, with all of the research I did, there were huge fees that came with any gold payment setup. Molyneux is right, there is a large amount of cost behind being backed by gold. The sites I checked out charged a fee every month or so for storage/security and the cost of getting your gold or making a transaction was usually a few percent. When I factored in the amount of money I would spend to have my spending money in gold it cost much more than the inflation I was losing with fiat.With Bitcoin I could pay the .1% to transfer my dollars to bitcoins and by the time I go to spend it, on average, the value has gone up vs the dollar much more than .1%. Even if I need to cash out and pay another .1% to pay for something with USD the gain in value is worth it unless I am paying for something on the same day that I get paid. Which is how I pay my mortgage. Otherwise I transfer my paycheck to bitcoins. Yes, I have read much of this book and seen several articles/videos on road privatization. This thread is for people posting their out of the box ideas.Here are a few of mine:The simplest would be highways. These already exist, but could be improved upon by Bitcoin. The road I used to commute to work on had tolls, but you would buy a pass with an RFID in it and instead of stopping at the toll booth you just drive through a side lane that recorded your RFID as you passed through. For the card I would just go online and fill my account with money, I set it up to auto-draft when it got below $50.There could be a few options of doing this with Bitcoin. Either have an account the same way with the option of funding it with Bitcoin anonymously, this would prevent any sort of way to track people's movements. Another option is having a tiny Bitcoin device that holds your bitcoins which can actually transmit a transaction at the tolls for payment.Another option is to have a lane that is a smart road. Cars could be upgraded to be able to work on the smart lane where magnets or other devices are embedded into the outsides of the road and the car detects them, keeping a safe distance inside the lane and keeping a safe distance from the car ahead and behind. This would allow a faster commute and the ability to not have to pay full attention to the road while on the smart lane.Smart roads also allow for the ability to charge electric cars via electric induction with a two way communication which could allow for payment via Bitcoin easily in real time using microtransactions. It would also allow for Internet communication from the road allowing people to surf the Internet and check their e-mail on their way to work or wherever they are going.Smart roads would also eliminate the problems of drunk driving or worrying about people talking on their cell phones. And with car accidents being one of the main causes of death and drastically reducing auto accidents would cut car insurance drastically and would make up for the cost of upgrading to pay for the better road.Highways and long distances are the easy part. The tricky part is in towns.One obvious one is the local merchants paying for it which has been mentioned. Disney World actually has their own private roads near their parks. For payments at roads with stop lights I had the idea that people could pay for faster light changes where the price to time would exponentially increase depending on how much quicker you would want the light to change. And it would accumulate depending upon the amount of people sending their money to get it to change. So when you are sitting in traffic pissed at the amount of time it is taking and you are in a long line of people you can just hit the amount of BTC you want to pay to speed up the light and if there is a long enough line then you can all speed it up. It would of course have a minimum amount of time to allow two way traffic. If you had a big night or an emergency you may be willing to spend a buttload on having a clear shot to your destination. Though with smart roads, if all cars are moved by the road there would no longer be a need for traffic lights and traffic would be moved at the most optimal pace possible.For roads in front of homes I would love to own those roads and provide free use of those roads. We could get rid of all of the electric poles, telecom poles, etc. I would create the road with large cement pipes which would allow piping electric lines, telecom lines, water pipes, sewer pipes, gas pipes, heat pipes, etc.  This could also allow for multiple companies renting space and provide more competition between utility companies.Another option for these thousands of miles of road/surface area facing the sky is solar. Either panels above roads or work on a polymer that could be used on the road to produce electricity. At this moment I believe mBTC is best. We will likely hover close to $1000/BTC for a while and that will make 1 mBTC close to 1 dollar. That will make things easy. That would be cool.It would be great to create a regular money ATM that also includes a Bitcoin option. Anyone who uses that word is a duplicitous taint. http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b1d409d0-5399-11e3-b425-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2leCPogddNovember 24, 2013 7:00 pmUS banks warn Fed interest cut could force them to charge depositorsLeading US banks have warned that they could start charging companies and consumers for deposits if the US Federal Reserve cuts the interest it pays on bank reserves.Depositors already have to cope with near-zero interest rates, but paying just to leave money in the bank would be highly unusual and unwelcome for companies and households.The warning by bank executives highlights the dangers of one strategy the Fed could use to offset an eventual tapering of the $85bn a month in asset purchases that have fuelled global financial markets for the last year.Minutes of the Feds October meeting published last week showed it was heading towards a taper in the coming months  perhaps as soon as December  but wants to find a different way to add stimulus at the same time. Most officials thought a cut in the interest on bank reserves was an option worth considering.Executives at two of the top five US banks said a cut in the 0.25 per cent rate of interest on the $2.4tn in reserves they hold at the Fed would lead them to pass on the cost to depositors.Banks say they may have to charge because taking in deposits is not free: they have to pay premiums of a few basis points to a US government insurance programme.Right now you can at least break even from a revenue perspective, said one executive, adding that a rate cut by the Fed would turn it into negative revenue  banks would be disincentivised to take deposits and potentially charge for them.Other bankers said that a move to negative rates would not only trim margins but could backfire for banks and the system as a whole, as it would incentivise treasury managers to find higher-yielding, riskier assets.Its not as if we are suddenly going to start lending to [small and medium-sized enterprises], said one. There really isnt the level of demand, so the danger is that banks are pushed into riskier assets to find yield.The danger of negative rates has deterred the Fed from cutting interest on bank reserves in the past. If it were to do so now, it would most probably expand a new facility that lets banks and money market funds deposit cash at a small, positive interest rate. That should avoid any need for banks to charge depositors.About half of the reserves come from non-US banks that do not have to pay the deposit insurance fee. Their favourite manoeuvre is to take deposits from money market funds and park them overnight at the Fed, earning millions of dollars risk-free. Cutting the interest on reserves would stop that.Lowering interest on reserves would also affect money market funds, said Alex Roever, head of US interest rate strategy at JPMorgan.[It] would decrease the incentive for those banks to borrow in the money markets, which in turn could leave money market funds short of certain investments and force them to bid up the price of their next best options, he said.Richard Gilhooly, strategist at TD Securities, highlighted some benefits to the Fed from the possible cut: [It] would not only anchor short-term rates near zero, it also stands to boost the profits for the Fed as they pay less interest to banks, he said. Right in the middle  This thread is solely for people who can think. People who can think outside of the box to post how they would create a road system or a way for people to travel without the need for government.You can describe it on a small scale, at the city or county level, the state level or nationally.Your system must allow people to have easement enough to leave their homes and get to the road system.I have self moderated this thread to allow people to throw out ideas without people nitpicking every little idea to death.I will throw my ideas out there but would like to see what others think (please do not just post links to other private road systems).As a bonus, how would you incorporate Bitcoin into your system?  You speak of taxes like they are magic.How do you get that money from people? Looks like we will be hanging around this price for a while.Lock in your buys when it falls under $800 and sell what you need when it is over $850.I am actually glad it did not shoot up to an unsustainable price before returning to this price. Had we shot up to $1,600 then came back to $800 we would be in the same place but have the stigma of yet another bubble. How should they take those people's money? Source?
I love when idiots do not buy bitcoins at their currently low price. Witch! How would YOU structure a private road system?Do you possess the ability to think outside of the box? One of the biggest questions one can ask is "What is Mankind?"To answer this all you have to do is break the word up into two words:Mank and ind.What do these words mean? Nothing, they make no sense.And such is mankind. Many people are getting into Bitcoin for many reasons, many of them seeing only understanding portions of the advantage of Bitcoin such as making money or low transaction costs.When governments fall they will be quite confused as to how it happened. Bitcoin takes 6 confirmations before it is mathematically unlikely that someone can do a double spend.Credit cards take 6 months. How does killing someone compensate the victims? Some people hold dollars for more than the time they need it to make a purchase.In that time they could have gained value as bitcoins. People who want something will have it built. By 2020 we will be able to ride our flying cars to different countries to arbitrage localbitcoins very easily. I asked this same questions 2 years ago during Thanksgiving figuring 4 days of closed banks would bring the price down quite a bit.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52662.20The price ended up going up. The private keys will still be available in cold storage. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=341554.0 I am sure this is what you meant.When will people learn that governments do not always have their best interests at heart. This question is asked so often that more computing power is used on the question than all coins mined to date.There is even a thread on the main page asking the same thing. I am looking to automate a process of importing a private key to a client, send a certain amount from the client then delete the private key before moving on to the next private key.Currently I am figuring I can set up a fresh wallet.dat, import a private key and send the BTC, then overwrite the wallet.dat with a copy of the fresh wallet.dat.There should be a better way. How do we keep people who use Bitcoin to buy offensive things like pornography or devil music such as Metallica or One Direction or non-mainstream religious material such as some forms of Christianity or certain Muslim/Jewish teachings?I know most people have been thinking about this but I am bold enough to say it.One solution may be to require webcams to be attached to all Bitcoin clients with desktop streaming and we monitor every person spending their money. The more centralized solution the better of course. Hmm, so it is basically just inputting a password for you. That seems less secure since it would probably need to store the password on the computer.Any thoughts on the most secure computer/OS for cold storage? Preferably something small. I am looking to become more international, I am working toward making it so I can work solely on the Internet with no requirement of location.That way I could get a small apartment in some Asian country for a few months, Costa Rica for a few more, go to conferences when they come up, etc.Or just live wherever people will accept bitcoins.The key is to cut down on possessions. I have a storage unit in the US that I some day need to go in and clear out to get rid of most of it.Eventually I would like to be one of the first people living on a seastead. I have indicated my willingness to a few of the projects in the works and hope one of them works out. Many of us live in a country under a tyrannical government that would use such information against us.
I was going to buy a laptop solely for cold storage and was wondering if it would be of any use to get a Lenovo which has a fingerprint reader.Would this be enough security so that only my fingerprint can allow access to the computer?I would imagine that such a device would have workarounds for those who's reader stops working or they need into the computer without it.I had one once when I worked for IBM as my work computer but they turned off the reader in the BIOS by default for us so I never used it. It would just be silhouettes and code on the screen with a mysterious setting that will make it so you cannot tell whether it is Japan or the UK. Is btcchina.com set up to withdraw to Chinese bank accounts?If I were in China would I be able to get a China bank account? I agree, when the price is going up I am useless. All sorts of questions and unknowns, at X$/BTC how does that affect my life, job decisions, mortgage payoff, etc...After all of this crazyness I have stopped thinking about it. I am just keeping my BTC in my wallet and not worrying about it until after the new year. I bought at around $500 on the 20th.I had some money in there and planned on buying right before the ACH deposits started flowing since I figured nobody else would have dollars in there while everyone waits for their ACH to start transferring.Unfortunately I did not notice the 7 day delay. Oh well, I did get some cheap coins. We need these things in every major international airport. If you could get local fiat out it would be even better. I have had a lot more.Then again, I could have bought Google stock back then too. Or any other stock that did well.I bought 50 ounces of gold for $400/oz.Then sold it all at $425/oz. I bought as it was coming down in June 2011 at $17. I admit that I had a plan when it hit around $300 to sell a good portion above $900 (basically once it hit $900 I was going to have my finger on the trigger whenever the price started going down).I was sitting in my office at work (I work about 100 yards from where I sleep) and saw it climb from $800+ then I saw $900 and headed back to my room to get ready to sell. By the time I got to my room it was down below $800 and falling.I had some BTC on BitFinex and tried to sell as it was falling toward $700...I guess I did not have my funds in the right wallet on there (quite confusing) and the sell did not go through. It kept falling and finally as it hit around $660 I said screw it and shorted everything I had on there (I assumed it was the big crash).It kept falling down to $550 and I figured at least I was making up for some of the loss of value. Then it started climbing back up and the site started to lag for me. As it got up over $600 and $650 I rushed to close the short. Unfortunately the short did not close until $690. I lost a few BTC.During that whole thing I had transferred almost all of my BTC to BitFinex but it sat unconfirmed most of the night.When I woke up BitFinex was down. I know they are a copy of Bitcoinica which stole people's money and disappeared. I sat there at work for several hours with thoughts of all of my bitcoins being lost. The horrible thought of that had me going nuts.As soon as the site came up I moved all of my money back to my wallet where it is now nice and safe. And that is where it will stay except when I spend it.We will be over $1,000 and $10,000 in a few years. Playing the market comes with the risk of losing BTC. I am done with all of that. I grabbed a bunch of LiteCoin back in the day but am not very confident in its adoption.The alt coins lose value for every new alt coin created. Bitcoin has dominated and established itself so well that it has become Bitcoin and "everything else". Eventually someone will create a program to allow anyone to just come up with their own alt coin and you will start to see dozens created daily and there will be no reason to invest in them. I have lost more bitcoins trying to time the market than anything.I was going to try to time the crash this time but started running into the same uncertain market conditions as usual.It went well in March when I just held through the whole madness. I have returned all of my BTC to my wallet and will continue to hold through this madness. CampBx was good when they had Dwolla and will probably be decent with ACH.One big problem is that if you run into any difficulty it takes forever for the problem to be resolved and it is like talking to a defunct company.Though that is the same with MtGox though I do not use MtGox anymore. Ahh, the search sucks on here then. I searched for BitFinex sorted by most recent and saw nothing. Must be case sensitive. I get the message:"Our platform is currently being upgraded. Please stanby while our hamsters are working hard to make Bitfinex a faster platform. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach us at support@bitfinex.com"Does this happen often? I just moved most of my BTC to them and it would royally suck that the first time I do that they take everything and disappear. I look forward to it, I've been stuck with dollars in my bank account and I would rather they were bitcoins. Looks like someone tried to throw a quick pump and dump in there to trigger weak hands.We are still on target with a supported price around $700 today to hit the $1000 target by the weekend and $1600 in time for Thanksgiving turkey. USBs carrying viruses has been known.Burn CDs from offline wallets to move private keys for spending. How cute, you are trying to sell your (one of thousands) alt coin on the Bitcoin Talk forum. I have plenty of BTC in my Bitfinex trade balance and when I went to sell a few of them I got "Invalid order: not enough balance".Am I missing something?I even tried "sell all" to see if it would execute and I got the same thing. Ever since Dwolla stopped accepting CampBx I have stopped using them since I can only do things electronically.So I have been stuck letting my paychecks accumulate for a while and now have $30k waiting to be able to go on an exchange. I look forward to the ACH capabilities of CampBx so I can start buying again.Considering it takes about 2 days to transfer, I can see a boost starting on the 22nd (They start accepting ACH on the 20th).
Up 138% for the day so far. I do not have many LTC but it is interesting to note because it shows that Bitcoin could do the same thing without any huge crash.Last time the crash came because MtGox was DDoSed and people panicked. This time we have the Chinese and we have multiple stable exchanges, we could seriously double a few more times, maybe even reaching the point of doubling in a day like LiteCoin did today.Hold on to your hats folks (and your bitcoins). What is this "sell"?Seriously though, my mortgage is about $150k. I will sell one bitcoin when it gets that high since my mortgage company already told me they will not take Bitcoin. My calculation was close based on hitting $500 by Tuesday. We hit that 2 days early so the price may go up a little higher than $1600.Either way, we will be at $1,000 by the end of the week based on past performance and climb quickly to the peak Thanksgiving weekend. I need to create a cypher of some data and I would like to use a Bitcoin public key to encrypt it with its corresponding private key to decrypt it.I am doing this in Java and looking at the Cypher class I see RSA and other keys but I doubt they can be used with Bitcoin addresses.Is there an easy way to do this or some sample java code I could use?Am I correct in the belief that creating a cypher of data with a public key is different from the bitcoin client's creation of signing a message? Kasmir Hill who works for Forbes and writes many articles about Bitcoin is someone who is very informed on many matters of Internet privacy and does her due diligence with her Bitcoin research knowing where to go to get information as close to the source as possible. She also lived on Bitcoin for a week so she has a good understanding of how it works. The last huge price rise came along with the FinCEN regulations.Do not underestimate the desire of Americans to have every part of their life regulated and ruled by their masters in DC. I believe this could be big. Plenty of our friends and family are probably curious about Bitcoin and would want to buy some if they could do it easily through something like PayPal or something easy like that.Having something pop up on your wall saying "I am looking to sell bitcoins (or buy)" may get some people on your friends list interested.I am up for being part of this if you want to go ahead with it. Though I would not be in 100% as I already have a project.I could possibly contribute programming or money toward such a venture. Looks like something that could work quite well. Quoting to remind future us that in 2013 $151,998 was considered a lot of money. People were telling me to sell it all when it went up to $70. People can only see dollar signs and do not understand bitcoin signs which are better.I have given a bitcoin out to each of my nieces and nephews this year and none have spent it. I basically gave them a vanity address and a private address in a card telling their parents to keep it safe. I still have one niece and nephew with birthdays this year...they will get a very expensive gift. What holiday do you buy gifts for? With 5 Fridays this month many people who get paid every other Friday will get 3 paychecks in November, I know I will.This means that for the many people who do their budgets based upon 2 paychecks each month, this month they will have an extra one which can be used to spend on something extra.That something extra could be a full paycheck towards buying bitcoins. I made the mistake of selling some at $99 thinking that it would crash to under $95 so I could make a little bit of money. It kept going and I had to buy back in around $110.We will likely hit $1,000 some time around Thanksgiving. We are still on track if we hit $500 by Tuesday which appears to be very possible. I have heard Game of Thrones is good, have not watched it yet.I liked Smallville.There is also Corner Gas if you like dry Canadian humor(humour?).And of course, The Office. So Jesus is just a computer program? I like to start self moderated topics, the moderators do not tend to moderate things like going way off topic.What would Jesus do? 10k?It's over 9000! Heh You are 13 and have a few years so you need to plan for the possibility that bitcoin prices could crash. I am uber bullish but you need to only invest would you can afford to lose. A college education is not something you should risk losing.If you keep your money in bitcoins be sure to work hard in school and make sure that even if you have no money for college that youcan qualify for scholarships because of your good grades.
governments...how cute I like to check the prices vs gold once in a while here:https://coinabul.com/index.php/gold-weight/1-troy-ounce.htmlUsually everything listed is available. Today almost all of them are out of stock.Smart move if you believe it is the top, buy some gold to hedge your investment.As of right now it is around 3.8BTC/oz. The 15% shutdown of useless jobs which were all backpaid was useless. Yes, I used to want smaller government. I was going to give 1 BTC to everyone for Christmas...now I am re-thinking that I can still buy gifts with bitcoins though, so why would I sell? What part of the First selloff are we at? I convert most of my paychecks into bitcoins. I have held off since the climb since I would like to catch a dip once we have a good idea where the average will be for the next few months.But I am in it to keep as many bitcoins as possible.Trust me, you will want as many as you can have very soon.  Ahh, ya I guess whatever term refers to me going back to putting every paycheck into bitcoins. No, I hold through the whole upswing. I spend my days thinking about all of the money I am making and how it will change my life.When it goes down I just have to wait until it levels out to know when to buy back in. For some reason I have a harder time getting anything done when the price goes up as I do when it is going down. Many gambling sites have already switched. My site will display everything in mBTC. You can choose to refer to it solely as mBTC from now on, that is your choice. Either way, we had a window into what will be. Good thing he gave a heads up. I had .000104 BTC on there. Ok good. http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/btcchina.comIt's not just you! http://btcchina.com looks down from here.Edit: As indicated below, you can connect via this link: https://vip.btcchina.com/ This is when I buy more. We are still on track for this.If we hit $500 in 10 days we will be about 2 weeks away from $1500-$2000.It will reach that height, as far as the correction...I believe the Chinese influence throws those results into unknown territory. The price is moving so fast now that moving money from one exchange to another means you are missing gains. The Chinese will be calling people asking to buy our bitcoins. And the Chinese did not start to become major buyers of Holland's tulips.
By the time you transfer your coins to BTCChina, cash out and get it into an account to put on bitstamp the price will be beyond $400. The Chinese do not understand the concept of a bubble.In the US the housing bubble eventually came to an end.In China, the housing bubble grows and instead of coming to and end they just continue to build empty cities. I call $10k by 2016, but if we keep rising 10 times per year it will be a lot sooner than that.Even so, I locked in my prediction here:1 Bitcoin will be worth at least $10,000 by 12/31/2016http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532 By the time I want to sell my bitcoins, I will not need. This is scary. If you have 10 BTC, hold them until you can buy 11 more so that you can have one of a million possible bitcoins. Well, the price has been steady for several months around $100-$125...so I see the first double at around $250.That double took about 4 weeks. If it goes to $500 in 2 weeks then we know we are on track for $1,000 in a week after that. That is where it will become unstable. The price has only doubled once...all other crashes came after at least 4 doubling. It appears that you are correct. Capital gains do not fall under earned income.http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Earned-Income-Exclusion---What-is-Foreign-Earned-Income Bitcoin is a currency solely because people are willing to put their faith in it as such.Without Bitcoin's brand and trust it would not be as useful.By supporting alt coins you dillute the Bitcoin brand as the ultimate currency. It confuses people who have never heard of crypto currencies and takes away from Bitcoin.That being said, if everyone were using bitcoins I would support competition with other alternative currencies as at that point you are swapping good money for possibly better money. Currently we are trying to swap bad money for good money.Bitcoin will create the infrastructure for alt currencies to survive. Focussing on that is more important than trying to bring another currency in to do that. Good question, I have only had to deal with it for my income. But I thought that if you sell within a year of buying you have to claim it as earned income. Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - Physical Presence Testhttp://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Earned-Income-Exclusion---Physical-Presence-TestIt is 330 days, for 2013 the exclusion is $97,600 plus you can include your housing expenses up to 16% of the exclusion/$15,616 (for a full year). This is false.You are supposed to pay capital gains taxes on any gain that you make, even if it is for a purchase.If you buy 1 BTC for $10 then buy a $300 watch with that 1 BTC you have to claim the $290 gain when you make the purchase.All that said...the guy selling you the watch is not going to be reporting that purchase to the IRS.But being the good citizen I always report everything I do to the government because they know best and IRS agents are my heros. One thing some people may want to consider that I am currently taking advantage of is the fact that you do not have to pay US taxes up to the highest income bracket (around $100k) if you live outside of the US for 330 days out of the year. The income break covers the time away, not tax year. I am currently out of the country making money tax free (up to the high bracket) and will likely continue to do so.You have to keep your US residence so you should try to find a state with no income tax (I use Florida for my residence). Otherwise you will have to claim residency of the country you are in and have to pay taxes there.So if you wanted to you could cash out up to $100k of your BTC while staying in another country...get a nice place in Costa Rica while working on a Bitcoin project from your computer...all tax free. The price will peak at $1600 then fall back down to hold steady around $1,000 for several months.Let it be known.It is so. Someone is having fun with the prices. Looks down. 6000 BTC to $500/BTC7000 to $1000!!  $500 here we come! USB devices are prone to spreading viruses, why would you go through the trouble of creating an off network machine with armory to set up your bitcoin wallet only to move data from a USB drive back and forth from a networked computer which could infect your off network machine with a virus?Was it not USB drives that were used to spread a virus that took out one of Iran's nuclear reactors?Would not QR codes be a better means of transferring coins from an off network computer to a networked machine?Or even just burning a CD (CDs are cheap now).
Google is also having the same problem of nobody buying their stock because it is too expensive.Google IncNASDAQ: GOOG - Nov 6 6:54 PM ET1,022.75+1.23 (0.12%) There is no way anyone would do anything illegal with Bitcoin now that the FBI has shown us how great and mighty they are. You can pretty much rule out anyone ever doing drugs ever again. When it doubles for the fifth time it will crash to the 3rd double and then even out to the 4th. 1 mBTC only costs 27 cents.They are cheap. Coinbase is currently at $272 and MtGox is at $266. So those with cash stuck in Gox can buy bitcoins, and sell them on Coinbase to get their money out. When you look at the ultra-rich they tend to live internationally. I do not plan on cashing out of Bitcoin, I already have cash...it is called Bitcoin.I like the idea that when I want to cash out, I will not need to. After seeing it go up my co-worker finally bought in at $204 (about 10). After it then dropped to $180 and came back up he sold it all at $205. Next stop: $300! All bitcoins combined at the current price ($262 on Gox/$253 on Bitstamp) is worth over $3 billion. We are close to the $266 all time high and we will soon be at 12 million bitcoins total.Interesting numbers. It is quite the momentous occassion, but which exchange do we go by? It may even be the Chinese exchange that passes it which is not as exciting as seeing it pop over the threshold on a USD chart. I considered selling a big chunk of mine last night with the thought that it would go down.I had to bring my client up to date which took most of the night.Then I realized I am not ready to deal with the tax consequences of turning bitcoins into government money.I will just continue to hold and spend. For my website I am currently displaying everything in mBTC. I am figuring BTC will be worth about $1,000 in the next few years during the main stages of the website's beginnings so 1mBTC/dollar will make it easy for the users to understand.If I were to use Satoshis, the numbers would be too extreme and I believe that some may consider Satoshis just as relevant as a LTC or PPC. Bitcoin has gained its place as the main cryptocurrency through its standing as the first and most well known cryptocurrency. There may even be a better alt currency but it will not catch on the way Bitcoin has without some major media and marketing which would take a huge undertaking.If down the road the price is up over $100,000/BTC then a move to uBTC would be practical, and at that point it would be so well known that people would understand what a uBTC is.As for decades down the road when it would make sense to use Satoshis...I do not expect there to even be Federal Reserve Notes that far down the road so there will be bigger things to worry about between now and then. This is where the free market stops. I can honestly say I have no idea what the hell is going on. I still have buy orders set at $86/BTC that were close to being taken up on CampBx just a month ago. I find it interesting that the old methods of attack do not even get a blink out of Bitcoin users.University professors take it on, politicians try to stop it.I fully expect a public attack by George Clooney at any moment which will be seen as the final nail in the coffin of this whole "Bitcoin" idea to be followed shortly thereafter by a rise in the price of Bitcoin. And the establishment will be flaberghasted that people are not dropping it left and right. I tell the precious metal people to buy precious metals for long term investment and Bitcoin for medium to long term investment and for short term investment/spending. Wow, not even a jitter in the Bitcoin price with this coming out. This is quite the stable rise. Maybe the government can just take away people's coins and give them to you. That would be fair right? Almost anyone who supports government is a supporter of forced wealth redistribution. Your mortgage is an unfunded liability for future years.You promised to pay $150,000. You did not have $150,000 but you promised that over the next 30 years you would pay it.I work in the government contracting world. Some projects I work on the government will say, this is a 3 year contract which will do X the first year, Y the second year and Z the third year.They may tell Boeing that they want a new airplane, they tell them they want it in 10 years and that they will buy 50 planes and pay $2 billion a year toward development with a support contract on each plane for 5 years after that and they will pay $500 million per plane once they are delivered. All future money, all locked in no matter who is in office (Republican or Democrat). 
Hmm, perhaps a Facebook app that shows on your wall that you purchased X BTC for Y fiat along with the transaction ID.This would help prevent chargebacks via humiliation of your friends and family if the payment does not go through.Plus the added bonus of people being exposed to Bitcoin. The whole point of Bitcoin is to not pay taxes.Except in the US because I always pay all taxes and sometimes a little bit extra for good measure. And I love the IRS because they are all great guys. Reform by offering better alternatives. Logging into bitcointalk and allowing images to be viewed makes you a target for hackers. Most exchanges allow you to get your money out electronically, but very few allow for electronic deposits.Hence the reason the price of CoinBase would be so high...easier movement of dollars to bitcoins than the rest of the exchanges. Considering you cannot move money to CampBx via Dwolla anymore CoinBase appears to be the only site you can get money to electronically. The goal of the government should be to do whatever people pay for. The page is up for me. I suspect that the quantity will drop after the first day excitement dies down. I doubt someone would use this regularly because the exchange price is quite a bit. You would likely use it if you were in the area and were low on cash or if you were traveling to Canada and did not bring canadian dollars.One of these in every international airport would be wonderful though. The major Bitcoin companies that open up are opened with the help of those "hoarders" who did not give away all of their coins to some charity that would convert their bitcoins right away to fiat.Greed is what motivates someone to spend hours and days stuck behind a computer screen writing code for the next bitcoin advance or service. Providing a service without profit is the making of a flash in the pan moment that will not see the light of day.Good luck with your YouTube videos. Be sure to give away all of your bitcoins so that you have no influence on future Bitcoin ventures. Perhaps it is a trial run of a Project Blueseed type of setup where they plan to test it out in calm waters before moving 12 nautical miles off shore to avoid most US laws. Bitcoin is priced at about 5g of gold right now. Easiest way I have done is to create a vanity address. Give them a card with the vanity address and private key. Tell them to safeguard the private key with a simple link to the blockchain.info link where they can import the private key.Then send your bitcoin to that vanity address.Keep a copy of the private address just in case they forget about it then ask about it later (when they find out more about it) telling you they lost the card. With that much I would go with one of the exchanges that has the lowest price. First send a wire transfer of a relatively small amount, a few thousand dollars, just to get used to the process.Then once you have the process down send the rest.Once you purchase your bitcoin, send it to a secure offline wallet. Learn about that as well with your few thousand dollar purchase. Do not trust third parties with your bitcoins. Either create a vanity address or several, print out or write down the public and private key. Or create a paper wallet or create a wallet and put it on a disk/USB, whichever you feel comfortable with.Put that all in a safety deposit box. Maybe even have a few backups in different places that are very secure.As for what you could lose...in the short term you could lose around half of it, in the long term it is likely to go up.But in the end, Bitcoin is all about being a spendable currency. Keep some bitcoins available for buying things. When the price was low I bought the domain name 2bitstore.comThe plan was to have a daily product (like w00t.com) that 'only' cost 2 bitcoins.At the time it would have been $20 products. Now there would be some very expensive items. Yes, do not side with libertarians because while you may want freedom for one thing you don't want freedom all  the time.Think of the children. Heh...such an intrusion into our privacy could one day become the first step toward privatization of the roads. I do, but I found out that was in the top searches after I told my buddy about Bitcoin and he wanted to know how to buy them he said that was the top in his search. Google:how do I buylook at what comes up The easiest way would be for the government to set up a 0% exchange and start only accepting payments in bitcoin.The exchange could be set up so that it is as simple as paying your government bills, sending a check or whichever process was done previously to pay your taxes or fines. The money is then converted and the bill is paid in bitcoins.The government would then use a bitpay type of setup to allow people who get government funding to receive either bitcoins or their local currency. But all they pay out is bitcoin.They could then start paying off all of their debts in their local currency until all of their debts have been paid. This would likely have the affect of the bitcoin price going up vs the local currency which would encourage people to move their money over to bitcoins until the old currency becomes worthless and people are just paying directly in bitcoins for their taxes and fines.The government could also help with an education campaign to help people understand how to pay and accept payments in bitcoin and safeguard their wallets.
If you are ok with the government having its hand in just about every aspect of your life, why would you care about the NSA being yet another helping  hand? There were law enfocement folks at our Ron Paul meetups too. Hell, Minnesota designated all Ron Paul supporters as potential terrorists. Lex LuthorShrugging off political correctness to fight off an alien that does nothing but invite trouble. 1) Please point out the small island that is not controlled by any nation.2) Also, please tell me how you plan to build an artificial island in middle of the ocean that can deal with the occassional 100 foot wave.For answers to these questions see http://seasteading.org It used to. BTCChina stopped climbing yesterday. MtGox and others continue to go up. This rally is ours now. During the last climb, MtGox got DDSed and everyone jumped ship as the lag prompted everyone to drop their bitcoin faster than everyone else. The last to log in were the ones holding the overpriced BTC.Now we are not as centralized and Gox has done some work on not getting DDSed again.So this time around the price can keep going up and up and up and people will start getting an itchy trigger finger trying to figure out when to sell but something will have to spook everyone.What do you think that will be? True, though I do not plan on buying until things settle down (crash). I would like to have fiat ready when it does. Ahh, ok. BIPS.me appears to be a merchant bitcoin payment site, not an exchange. Ahh, the bill pay checks allow for a memo. Maybe I will try a small transaction to test it. Hmm, I can send online bill pay checks from Wells Fargo. It would be great if that worked. Though I am not a big fan of their help support turn around. I am currently in Afghanistan on a military base. I have a lot of money I want to turn into Bitcoins but now that CampBx does not allow Dwolla deposits I have no way of getting money from my Wells Fargo account to an exchange.CoinBase allows for bank transfers but they also do not allow me to set a buy price.I checked the Wells Fargo site and the only way to send an international wire transfer is if I go into the store to set it up.Bitstamp, Bitfinex and BTC-e allow international wire transfers, CampBx allows USPS money orders.  By Monday. So where are we now? The price has doubled in the past 20 days...will it double again in 10 days? One clue could include geocaching...where you place the clue somewhere and provide hints on how to get there. So...sell at $1250...gotcha. I tend to buy when the mood on here is doom and gloom and hold when everyone is talking about how the price will never stop. Makes sense. We are just along for the ride on this one.You can scream bubble bubble at all of us and we could even agree, but it would not affect the price. I played for a while before getting busy on other things.Very fun game. I am curious to see when the first of these gets rolled out. Mainstream news pundits always include the word "bubble" whenever mentioning Bitcoin and a rise in price.
Very true...the worst time to buy is when everyone is excited about how rich they are going to be.The best time to buy is when even you believe that Bitcoin has failed and people should just get out what they can before it falls to zero. It is always a good idea to buy when the price is high.But if it crashes your friend may want to sell at the lowest point. It seems like Chinese citizens are desperate to get their money into some sort of investment. When the government allowed people to invest in a second home it became such a huge craze of investment that they now have empty cities of "second homes" built purely for investment. Whether it is Baidu or anything that gets the word to Chinese people with money to invest, if Bitcoin becomes even a sliver of the craze of other investments it will skyrocket the price.But yes, it will be a bubble. They are in a housing bubble right now and if the US defaults on its loans, China will be hit. So a huge Chinese investment in Bitcoin will not be a solid foundation. Quite tragic. Our federal government is hemeraging money so the Republicans attempted to stop one of the biggest entitlement programs in US history that will pretty much put the final nail in the coffin. But all they did was stop 15% of the government in an attempt to stop the utter destruction. This was not enough because we were still going deeper into debt.So instead of doing the right thing and stopping more government, the Republicans caved and allowed the Democrats to have unlimited spending (which they quickly took advantage of).So the GOP should be arrested for conspiracy to stand back and allow the Democrats to destroy the country. Ahh, the classic "I do not need to be regulated but there are people out there that need it".Kinda like when you watch a news program and they talk about "some people say".We do not need to fix problems for imaginary people. There are enough things to deal with already. It is a way. All you need is all knowledge of everything and you are all set. Figure out all of the things that could go wrong with Bitcoin. Then get inside information from all angles of those that could be involved in such a thing and when that bad thing happens, take advantage of the impending price drop.For Silk Road all you had to do was track down who the guy was that was running it and monitor him and the FBI to see when they arrest him.There was the bug in the code early in the year, you could have learned the code and found the bug yourself and waited to see if anyone else found it as well. When they did, sell.You could have found out who Pirate was and figured out when he was going to start defaulting on all of his promises.When the government stole MtGox's money you could have had a mole in the government to tell you before they did it.All very simple things that could be done. Find out the next thing that will drop the price and just time it. The Silk Road crash jerked us out of stability. The price is trying to find its new home. WTF??? LOL!?!!!?? I agree, they should not have caved. lol The response I got when I gave one BTC to my nephew last year when the prices was $45/BTC my sister said "thanks for the card, we'll have to check out this Bitcoin thing". Kinda like...thanks for the card, don't really care about your little nerd hobby...Then I will be able to join them this year and tell my nephew...so have you spent your Bitcoin yet (I know from the address he has not). No? You do realize it's worth over $200 right?At that point there may be some scrambling to find that card along with many questions on where to spend it. I give every year. Uncle Sam is nice enough to allow me to use TurboTax to determine how much I am supposed to give to charity at the point of a gun.You are welcome. I give Bitcoins out as a gift to my neices and nephews.First I create a vanity address for them.Then I get a word document birthday card and put the public and private address in the card.I also include something saying they can import the private key using blockchain.info, with the direct link. I guess I do have a Coinbase account already linked to my bank account. But the price there is just under MtGox and I see no way to set low bids. I have been using CampBx for the past few months to buy bitcoins. Then I had some problems and after a month of trouble tickets and messages they finally resolved it. I mainly went the CampBx route because of Dwolla and they have lost that advantage over the other exchanges.So...I am shopping for a new exchange.I have an ING account and Wells Fargo. Most likely I will need to wire from Wells Fargo.My purchases will be several thousand dollars every few weeks.I liked that I could use CampBx without submitting my life's story if I kept transfers to $1,000 per day. So far what I am seeing:MtGox...not a chance.CampBx - willing to lock up your money with no response for almost a monthCoinBase - requires a lot of verificationBitStamp - starting to require a lot of verificationBTC-e - I have used them but transferred BTC to them, never fiat, curious about their credibilityBitfinex - used them as well, but again only with BTCBitcoin-Central - would need to pay to convert my dollars to euros, not sure how their new setup isAny suggestions? Am I way off on anything?I would use localbitcoins if there was anyone local. There is not. Ahh, makes sense. I took everything out when Dwolla jacked them. Why would Gox run out of bitcoins?Currently the best way to make money off of them is to buy a bunch of bitcoins on the cheaper exchanges, send those bitcoins to MtGox and sell them at a higher price.It is cash that they will run out of sooner.I doubt they are trading bitcoins on other exchanges. And why would anyone withdraw bitcoins from MtGox? I got half sent through after sending a message to them on Facebook.https://www.facebook.com/?ref=tn_tnmn#!/CampBXWaiting on the second transaction. Yes, I avoid using any angles because of that.
Or we could just have all addresses expire after a year.We could rename Bitcoin to freecoin or something like that. As for the OP, take into account how many BTC you have right now. The bottom will drop out and you will be relying upon your current Bitcoin net worth to live on. That Bitcoin will buy just about what you can buy now with Bitcoin no matter what the value of the dollar is. A loaf of bread per Bitcoin will still be worth the same loaf of bread per Bitcoin price even if Bitcoin is worth $1,000 and the bread costs $50.The only benefit is if you are in debt. You will be able to pay off your house and other debt with a few BTC. Your income will be shit. Just because you paid taxes does not mean you deserve welfare.You paid SS taxes. Just like any other tax. That tax money combined with all of the other taxes to pay for Vietnam and a bunch of fun stuff that you benefitted from including welfare for the poor and for the elderly.You are now collecting welfare, paid for by our taxes. MOD NOTE:We don't need another thread about this, see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310962This is probably why the Bitcoin China price has climbed so much in the past few days (bringing the dollar price up with it).http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2013/10/15/baidu-google-bitcoin/ Perhaps some therapy could help you with your old coin uncertainty. The only reason to identify Satoshi is to use his humanity to discredit Bitcoin.It will be like claiming that the Pthagorean theorum is not sound because Pthagoreus slept with whores. It has been over 20 days and CampBx still refuses to credit the transfer.Now with Dwolla dropping them they will probably use it as an excuse to not credit me at all.I fear I will have to file a lawsuit and be one of many creditors scrambling to get some money when they go bankrupt. There is only CampBx and they seem like they are close to going bankrupt with their moves to keep users money and their policy of not responding to any user problems.I am sure Dwolla was getting tired of people wanting their money back when CampBx stopped crediting user accounts for transfers.If I was Dwolla I would have dropped CampBx as well. The leaders of the US have great regard for North Korea as they are trying to emulate your country all the time. It has been almost 20 days since I sent a $2,000 Dwolla transfer that they have not credited my account. You can easily post an image such as this:hosted on your own website.Then anyone who views that image, such as those that are viewing this thread, will have their IP address show up in your site logs.You can then use those IP addresses as you wish to try to trace every viewer of that image.You can then run hacking programs on each of those IP addresses to try to gain access to their computers.Then once in the computer there is a wealth of information that can be found on each and every person who viewed that image.Great stuff the Internet... You and several other people blacklist it and vow to never accept bitcoins from that address.And the rest of us will accept them and they will propagate out to the whole network. Well, I assumed by the heading that if you reside outside of the US then you are not required to have minimum coverage. But the wording seems the opposite. The residency requirement is fairly confusing for Obamacare.SEC. 5000A. REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE. (a) Requirement To Maintain Minimum Essential Coverage- An applicable individual shall for each month beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any dependent of the individual who is an applicable individual, is covered under minimum essential coverage for such month.-----(f) Minimum Essential Coverage- For purposes of this section-------(1)...(2)...(3)...(4) INDIVIDUALS RESIDING OUTSIDE UNITED STATES OR RESIDENTS OF TERRITORIES- Any applicable individual shall be treated as having minimum essential coverage  for any month--(A) if such month occurs during any period described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 911(d)(1) which is applicable to the individual, or(B) if such individual is a bona fide resident of any possession of the United States (as determined under section 937(a)) for such month.So...does this mean that if you are a resident of the US, you are considered as "having minimum essential coverage"? So...get rich then retire in Switzerland. Receive free money. If I worked at McDonalds and I was the only one out of 10 people not working, I would not say that McDonalds is shut down. Nor would any of the customers.Especially if I was one of the useless workers (like the ones that were furloughed). Almost 20 days and no resolution and no response from CampBx.$2,000 sent from Dwolla with transaction IDs. No credit for it on CampBx.They are ignoring any trouble ticket I send. I bought 6 BTC at $91 on campbx. I had 8 more at $82 but it did not fall that far. In theory, if DPR had 600k of BTC and will not have access to it or be able to give access to it for a long time that should mean the the short term price should go up 5% (5% of the BTC are essentially out of circulation).Also, if the FBI sells 27k BTC all at once that would drive the price down quite a bit. While 27k is not a huge percentage of the bitcoin network it would be a huge percentage of trade volume, all in the sell direction. A current drop of 27k BTC on MtGox would drop the price $20/BTC (which would likely spark a larger dive). Even if they sell it at public auction, someone will buy it for less than the dollar value and would turn around and sell most of it to recoup their investment.How do you think this will all affect the price now and in the future? If your local McDonalds closed the women's bathroom...would you say that McDonalds is shut down?Less than 15% of the federal government is shut down. Worst shutdown ever.
Governments with enough power can get rid of anyone, for whatever reason. Just ask the jews.But governments will evolve. I see Bitcoin being used in small countries and proving its worth to become that shining beacon on the hill for the rest of the world to follow. I support the big magnet approach. I had buys set up going down to $91 on campbx. I took to heart what someone once said.If you don't like the price of Bitcoin now...just wait. The 600k coins are not in a single address. The government only has power over your life because they have more power.You do not have rights, you are free to do whatever you want. It is only the power of others that limits what you can do and "allows you" to have rights. And you can do nothing about it unless you have more power.I believe through Bitcoin We can achieve the power to transcend governments. We can gain leverage. MtGox is a Bitcoin purchasing website. The federal government shut down! It is used to secure the Bitcoin blockchain from an outside attack.If he wishes to manipulate the blockchain all he simply has to do is expend more energy than what is currently being used to secure it. Just googled "cancer" because I was unaware that it existed.Thank you for making me aware of it.Now I am off to google "breast"... They did this early on with a thread to pay out X amount of donated BTC for getting an X size business to accept Bitcoin.I do not feel like searching for it. They paid out I believe. Ya, it went through on the Dwolla side. I e-mailed Dwolla and they said it went through and to take it up with "the third party site". Are these libertarians running their servers from authoritarian countries that could shut down their servers due to their users breaking laws?Do those libertarians have more power than the militaries and police of the authoritarian countries that they are running their servers from?Just like the rest of our lives, these libertarians are forced at gunpoint to abide by the laws of the people with more power. Last week I transferred money from Dwolla to CampBx on an almost daily basis. Each time the transfer went through almost immediately.On Friday, Sep 21st, I sent through two transfers (sent the same amount twice because I did not see it go through) and it still has not gone through.I put in a trouble ticket that same day and still have not heard any response.I like CampBx but I cannot risk losing money in transferring money to them. The worst thing the government could do which would completely destroy Bitcoin (and I do so hope that there are no government or federal reserve agents reading this and passing it along to their bosses to be hailed as heros for destroying Bitcoin) is to pour billions of dollars into buying bitcoins.If they were to skyrocket the price to say $10k-$100k each, then nobody would be able to afford them and Bitcoin would begin a slow fall toward uselessness. And if they were to go so far as to drive the price up to, say, a million dollars each Bitcoin, then Bitcoin would cease to exist immediately.Please do not let the federal reserve in on this secret. I would hate to see the price of a single bitcoin worth a million dollars tomorrow. Do not question the logic of this, I have done much research and know this to be true.  So the credit card industry's innovation is mobile payments?Kindly thank them for spending their advertising and marketing money to get people comfortable with something Bitcoin can already do. The more people get used to making mobile payments, the easier it will be to transition to Bitcoin. Interesting...you should post this on the Bitcoin Foundation board so that the members of that foundation know about it. Tieing power to people is an old/flawed idea.Bitcoin will allow us to tie power to power (bitcoins).

I just returned from a vacation in Australia for the past two weeks. From an outsider perspective it appeared that Abbott did well in getting across the message that he would give a $2k tax break to everyone with the removal of the carbon tax while there was much focus on the Labor guy getting ousted by his own party (or something like that).Also the message that since Labor has taken over there have been a lot of problems was a big one.Labor went after Abbott saying he would gut schools going for the "don't you want your children to have a good education?" approach.I think the approach of letting people know how much money they will get from voting for one guy or the other is a good one. I saw this approach done with the LP of Massachussetts once and they did better than usual (maybe 4% instead of 1%). People like to think that just by casting a vote they will get a few thousand bucks. Believing in God does not necessarily answer such questions. It just changes the questions.I believe in God and have the faith that He exists, I see that as separate from religion. Faith is what you believe, religion is how you practice that faith. So your religion just happens to be the practice of not believing in a higher being. But there is not really anything you need to do to practice such a faith. It would be like someone going to a conference for people that do not believe in Santa Clause or buying books about how you live a life of not believing in Santa. If you are struggling with living a life of not believing in Santa and society is making your life difficult for not having such a belief then fine, maybe gathering information from others may help you in such a struggle. But it should not be that difficult.Because we are all individuals we all get to determine our own self worth and what we want to do with this one chance we have at being alive on this world. You do not have to have meaning to it if you do not want. You do not have to survive, that is all your own choice but to not survive is a wasted opportunity. At the time he came up with them 1 BTC was worth like 5 bucks. A few people pointed out different ways people could break it (X-ray, other types of scans, etc). But the sentiment was that nobody would go through so much trouble for 5 bucks and they were meant more as a novelty and not a medium of exchange. Why would you be scared of buying one? Getting one from someone else you may want to consider the trust but buying one should be fine. It is good for cold storage. The Bitcoin Foundation is a private club. Why not discuss private club business at the club's forum instead of in an unrelated forum?Unless, of course, the people discussing it here are not able to discuss it there because they are not members...then, why does it matter to you what they do in their private club? Ahh. It is strange that their members are over here talking about their organization's matters. Republics are not supposed to be proportional. Finally! Perhaps all of the states should secede and then form a new country without Washington.That way, Washington keeps the $17 trillion debt and the new country has no debt and can start fresh. The new country can use the Constitution and go from there. Does the Bitcoin Foundation have its own discussion board? Yes, I was on the Seastead forum I worked on mesh radio networks as a contractor for the military for about 7 years. In rough terrains UAVs and blimps are essential. Though my work was all in simulating the network as opposed to any actual hardware. High altitude airships. I have done some work with these for the military.http://www.dailywireless.org/2006/05/11/big-brother-blimp/ Or better yet, create a system where the government just borrows money from the money printers who inflate the currency as needed. Then the money printers can charge interest and you can collect a tax to pay the money printers the interest on that debt. true story  Based on your dream I took a second mortgage out on my house and am putting it all into bitcoin. It should be transferred by Thursday. Let me know if you have a dream about doing ecstacy and throwing razors at some kid, that would change things quite a bit. You have obviously not watched '16 Candles'. It lays it all out right there. More than 16 green candles in one month is a huge indicator of a crash.There was a whole movie that explained this in detail. Although the message was sorta hidden in a lot of symbolism. Lesson learned for anyone else. Keep large amounts in cold storage. Only use online wallets for day to day spending. The pro-government people want government marriage but cannot get it and the anti-government folks want government marriage to themselves.The irony of ironies.
I had an idea back in the day to distribute the graphics rendering to all users.Basically you would log on and a square or sphere that you occupied would be rendered by your computer. Everything in that room would model the light, objects, etc.Going the route of a square you would have 6 sides that you would send/receive pixel information which includes the light/intensity/angle of direction and even for objects moving in and out each pixel could include mass/material/trajectory/speed/acceleration, etc.Someone in the adjacent square would be able to view your room through the wall of pixels and render it within their room which would be passed to the next room and on and on.This would allow for some very detailed graphics to be rendered in each room.The problem would be the large bandwidth cost of passing a lot of information between 'rooms'. I was hoping for enough compression and higher bandwidths down the road which could handle it.Never got around to testing just a single stream of light or anything, thought it would be a cool distributed concept though. Define...few IP address shows France but it could just be a hop. Quite cool.Have you thought of a way to create a wifi bridge that is funded (and funds) with Bitcoin? The implication being enough of those could create a completely wireless mesh network funded with Bitcoin  I recall looking into it a long time ago and that is what I found when looking at one set of building instructions. Though I could be wrong. I broke my medulla oblongata.It happened when reading the title of this thread. That is the thing about geodesic domes, I am pretty sure that the angles are not uniform throughout the whole dome. I have been setting up a vanity address with 1BTC for my neices and nephews for their birthdays.I just e-mail their parents a card they can print out with the public and private key in the card. Adding in the e-mail what they can do with it. I have been using CampBX, mainly because I had money in my Dwolla account before MtGox stopped taking it.They seem to be the lowest price per BTC but they also have a very low volume so if you make a huge purchase it would not be the lowest price anymore. This.And work toward converting your personal economic life to buying and spending bitcoin, instead of using fiat. Welcome to Speculation. It would be cool to see a ticker showing the name of the latest alt coin that has been created in the past hour or if necessary, the last 5 minutes. I was only speculating on price. That is why I posted in the speculation forum. There have been several other threads about this topic in other subforums so it is not like I am giving any clue to terrorists. The media itself says Bitcoin is used to fund drugs and terrorists (however untrue that may be).It is not a question of whether or not the USD has funded past attacks, they would point out that it is the anonymity of Bitcoin that allowed them to pull it off.I agree that it is likely that the terrorists are not using Bitcoin as it still is mainly a computer geek currency, but our whole effort is to make it mainstream so that anyone can use it.I think my personal opinion is that if the attack was 9/11 huge then I would trade my BTC for gold. If it was a Boston bombing type of size I would hold, maybe even buy into the short term panic. Hypothetically, if there were a boston bombing or 9/11 type of attack on the US or another country and they found out that all of the funding was through Bitcoin, what do you think would happen to the price afterwards?You know you would have the talking heads on the networks talking about how evil Bitcoin is with the usual "something has to be done" type of message. There would be knee jerk reactions aplenty.Would this drop the price? Or would the publicity, however bad, raise the price? The American dream of a house with a white picket fence and a car in the garage.It is basically an ideal of having a productive society where you work to pay for your house, you have a car that you can use to get to work and a fence to signify ownership of your own piece of the world.Unfortunately the banks took the dream and turned the house into your chains for your slavery to working for the bank and making payments on your car. And the fence became your prison walls where you are supposed to stay put and be a good citizen. There was a guy on here about a year ago guaranteeing a 7% return every week with his company. I forgot his username, seemed pretty legit. booby traps work in the movies I am sorry for the delay. I had hired someone to do the front end who assured me it would only take 2 weeks. He took a lot longer, I gave him some flexibility with the schedule since he was doing decent work for a pretty good price and there was no big rush.He actually did get me to about the 80% point and then dropped off the face of the earth with other projects.So I have taken over the front end work which for me has been a slight learning curve. The front end is written in extJs which I have used before and understood it on the project I was working on, but I had to read through all of his code to get caught up and back on track.I am writing everything from scratch so I am not using WordPress or any CM system so that it will be very flexible and I can build it the way I want it instead of trying to push a square peg into a round hole. Right now I am at the point on the front and back end to be able to sign up, set up your Bitcoin address, create a pool, all of the things needed for editing the pool, can create a proposal for the pool. Each group can view draft proposals, current proposals up for vote and past proposals. The voting is working on the back end but I need to finish that on the front end. Once you can go from creating an account to being able to vote I will open it up for Beta. It will still be rudimentary since I would like to add several other things but the basic functionality will be a good start for Beta.I am posting this more of a motivator for myself to get back on track  Here is my idea:  Create a way for one person to pose a problem, or a challenge or something that needs people to accomplish it.Then people with bitcoins can look through these problems and if they agree that they too want to be involved, they can pledge their own bitcoins towards that problem.Everyone will be able to see how much is pledged toward the various problems and as the pledges reach a certain large amount, then people with solutions will start to pose their solutions to the problem.The people who pledged toward that problem will be able to vote for the solution with their bitcoins.If enough people vote with their bitcoins toward a particular solution, the solution gets funded and the problem gets solved. If not, people get their funds back and wait for the next solution to be proposed.I call it BitPools  The Feds have a very good PR department.
Once your room is secured release some deadly toxins or air born disease into the room and never enter that room ever again. After seeing how well the US treats online businesses I am thinking that establishing my business in the US is not the best way forward.Are there decent web hosting companies based in Hong Kong that take Bitcoin? And what are the hurdles of starting a business there? Are there residency requirements?Or why use any country, what if I just had a server in a different country every month? A nomadic server with no permanent home. The only permanent thing would be the domain name. http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130816/14533924213/feds-threaten-to-arrest-lavabit-founder-shutting-down-his-service.shtml Before the bubble it was a common scenario for stability to be fuel for the rocket. The best way to come up with a betting  investing strategy is to create a bunch of investment charts showing lines going a certain way and then saying that when a line does X, then the market will do Y.If you convince enough people of that, they will do Y when they see X.Then when you instead do Z while they do Y, making money you remind them that it did X but it was part of some bigger pattern of XYZ which you knew about because you are so smart with patterns. So the next time they see that...just do Z. Then you do the opposite.And on and on...and now everyone knows all these crazy patterns and buys these tools and make money on selling the tools and teaching the patterns and coming up with new patterns...Fortunately most Bitcoin traders do not follow those patterns so they just come up with their own strategies and the patterns become irrelevant. Until someone convinces enough people that the patterns exist. That could be a possibility via BitPools.See my signature. Unfortunately we closed up the shop last year. Many retailers have some kid running the register. Or for restaurants you have waiters/waitresses.I set up my wife's clothing store through BitPay and everything is very convenient. The YouTube video I posted shows how the transaction takes like 30 seconds and they said that they had to slow down for the video. For retailers they like to be able to just put an app on their employee's phones and let them type in the dollar price of the purchase.It is as simple as that. No need to coordinate addresses for each employee or have conversions for bitcoins or a tracking system.BitPay will also allow the business owners to get all of their money in dollars. And it has a good tracking system of the payments.For a merchant that does not care about bitcoin but wants to accept them, BitPay is ideal. All they need is an app. The setup is easy, and they get their money in their bank account just like with the credit cards that they are used to.Their fee (1% I believe) is small compared to the convenience. BitPay, so convenient.https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZ-pqo0cLcE?autoplay=1&rel=0 So it's a profit deal.... This is what I aim to change with BitPools.Going from hierarchically organized power obtaining more power to simply organized power. I bring this up here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=266502.0Power is all that matters, nothing else. Unfortunately the thread turned into a typical right vs left game of semantics so I locked the thread.Will Blackwater be paid in bitcoins? Perhaps, or perhaps a competitor will emerge. Who will they work for? Whatever group of people wants to pool their money to pay them. Oil reserves in bitcoin? Maybe if enough people pool their funds and want to get into the oil game.Baby steps first. The old games are about to have a new challenger and Bitcoin will be a useful tool as a new way forward emerges. Can it dispense cheese? A matter of seconds:https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZ-pqo0cLcE?autoplay=1&rel=0 One word: Bitcoins Awesome. Good thing one of those stores has a gas station attached.The great thing is, after this documentary is finished, they will still be able to pay for most things using bitcoins in their home town. I agree, with the new setup you have to click on a creep 3 times if you want 3, then it spaces them out where there is not much advantage over just sending 1.A combination would be great too. But doable with fast clicks. lol It looks like the Utah couple filming their life on Bitcoin is 3 weeks into their 90 day experiment and they are not doing all that great.http://lifeonbitcoin.com/blog/One restaurant in their town is willing to accept bitcoins but the owner does not have a smart phone or wifi. And the couple has not yet been able to get a cell phone data plan to use to pay for things with bitcoin on their phones.At least the price has been fairly stable. Unlike when Kashmir Hill was doing it for a week and the price dropped from $130s to low $90s.I guess I should add these quick items about their project: It will not come up. I just like that NH has it in their Constitution. 
wait...what?Buying porn will be undetectable? As opposed to...? Bad things start happening when you send thousands of rats in all at once...For me it starts repeating the same thing over and over like deja vu on the screen without all of the rats. Even the part that makes it legal to revolt against the government?    You are welcome. Pay it forward. The war on bitcoins will do to the Bitcoin price what the War on Drugs has done to the price of drugs.We are all about to get stinking rich. This...is...HUGE!!! A quick response after my initial trial run.Quite fun. I assume graphics will come later but the concept is quite nice.  Perhaps have an AI to practice against.As someone with extreme lag at times I think it required that I refresh when I lost connection, which I believe kicked me out of the game I was playing and I had to start over with a new game. I would have expected to lose connection but come back into the same game (however poorly I would be getting my butt stomped, but still). I am currently beta testing another Bitcoin strategy game (bitfantasy.com) but will give yours a try, the two are different concepts but the more Bitcoin games the better. He has returned to install a poison pill into Bitcoin!He is mad at us all! We were not yet ready. From the public address, anyone can see the amount of bitcoins in that address.For example:https://blockchain.info/address/1PVypwAvvGcXAfVvxT67yrSARMCDfKzKfyThe private address is like your public adress's 'password' that you use to send bitcoins. Nice I do not know, the idea comes from an alien named Kpax. The Bitcoin scripts all require that you have your bitcoin client running.And if person A is not satisfied and person B feels that they are in the right, person A has all of the power and can deny person B from ever getting the funds. Or person A could be person B's competitor and purposefully withhold funds.It does help as far as a blanket send with no intermediary, but I believe a thriving Bitcoin escrow services industry will help things quite a bit. You may not want the government to see the donation address. http://www.payitforwardfoundation.org/ You are welcome.Pay it forward.   Pay for porn?  bittorrent, xnxx.com, redtube.com, youporn.com, mylifetime.com, etc.Even being in Afghanistan on a military base, with a 90% male population, making a lot of money I still do not see the reason to pay for porn. If you are doing a passthrough service you may want to avoid using a major bank or a single bank for payments.See: BitSpend.net
About 3 weeks ago those same people that are scaring Americans into voting for more government dropped a bomb about 100 yards from where I am sitting right now.About the only reaction it got from me was to go outside 5 minutes later after I was finished with what I was doing to see if I could see any indication of where it hit. That is on a military base in the Middle East on a 5 mile by 5 mile area.How big is the US? Why are people so worried about this? I do not worry one bit knowing the statistics of getting hit by a bomb are tiny.Do you worry every time you get on the road that you will die? Because it is very likely that you will, compared to getting killed by terrorists.Wake up people. You are being played. Quite an experience to live in fear isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. To get back on topic.It is these types of statements that are used to centralize power to the point that you have to put up with the whims of those who gain that power based upon such premises. Bitcoin will be able to put a stop to most of these economical centralizations but when it comes to military power and force there are larger hurdles to overcome. A global holiday 2 days after the only other global holiday is a great idea  Bitcoin is simply a ledger of user names with their corresponding balance of money.The only way to move money from one account to another is by using your password to take money from your user name and add it to someone else's user name.But in order to keep your user name and password from being hacked your user name is a long string of numbers and letters and your password is also a long string of letters and numbers.Everyone can see your user name, so if they have your password they can move your money.And new money is added by solving an algorithm. The user that solves it gets money added to his user account. I tried every Caeserian shift as well. I was going to go back and look for "the" but had moved onto other things by then. He should open source it and stick it in their eye. Copper resources?From now on all of my new threads in Politics will be self moderated. Two bold predictions for the wall of shame.  They already have technology that can detect if a person has seen a particular object or has knowledge of a certain thing.They spoke of using it to put pictures of bombs or such in front of something scanning for a reaction to see if they had seen it before.That is a very broad generalization of something I probably overheard in the background on TV. This thread is a good example of why just education cannot overcome the centralization of power. Some people vehemently support such power structures.Like those who support fiat and Keynsian economics, they will fight Bitcoin. Bitcoin just has to be a better alternative and prove itself as such. I would say that the power gets into the wrong hands with complacency and the fact that for it to get into the right hands in the first place takes a lot of effort. Effort that cannot be continued forever.My suggestion on how to defeat it? I have no idea, I am still mulling things over from an eyes wide open point of view trying to figure it out. But for sure, if the US government fell and it was replaced with some "libertarian Constitution", it would only last for a while as is. The new system needs to be so sound in its structure that it can compete against the current power of our government or a coalition of governments. And with the structure to continue.We need a system that is to democracy what democracy was to kingdoms and dictatorships. Just as Bitcoin is to gold as gold is to fiat. I believe we are at a point in time where we are ready for it. I agree with everything you said. It did require education for people to understand what liberty meant. There were many popular writings before the revolution, and I would say that Ben Franklin's printing press probably played a huge role in getting such ideas out to the people in as revolutionary a way as the Internet is doing today.Education, culture and technology can tip the scale back in favor of putting the power back into the hands of the people. But they have to organize, and to organize that tends to mean concentrating their power. In all of this, the court is referring to Bitcoins. It does not become generalized and address virtual currencies.So is LiteCoin not a currency and Bitcoin is?This must be what early airline pilots ran into when the first airplane laws were created. The very fact that they were defying the laws of gravity probably left so many government officials dumbfounded by how laws should be put in place for airplanes. I was not saying that we live in an anarchistic society, but an anarchist, survival of the fittest world. If you plop everyone down onto this world as babies they are not born with "inherent rights" or "natural laws". They have no laws whatsoever. That is anarchy by definition. As the babies grow and begin to form groups, those with the power will be the ones to determine which laws are in place and those without power will be doomed to follow the laws of those in power.Sure, history shows that sometimes we move toward a more free society through some social upheaval such as the Revolutionary War and rebellions. But that is the thing, only 10% of American society actually agreed with those who revolted against the British but those 10% had enough power to put their ideas at the forefront and win the war and thus holding that same power they were able to implement their ideals (because they had the power). Imagine if all of the US military were libertarians and the top libertarian general one day decided that the US should be libertarian. It would not take long for the US to then become libertarian. Because of the power.But just as with the United States, that power was passed on to people who did not share that same revolutionary spirit. Our forefathers retired and the other 90% worked their way into positions of authority, thus bringing us back to the original ideals of Britain that we had fought against.So if there is ever another revolution or push toward freedom. Just keep in mind that it will need to ensure that those who support freedom are kept in charge of the power, for generations. Thomas Jefferson's plan to do this was saying that "the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.". This did not happen. I wonder if the FBI would even have the infrastructure in place to confiscate all of SR's bitcoins.One person in the loop knows the private key and they are suddenly rich. I believe there were several early highlights of vulnerabilities including some sort of x-ray or such imaging device. At the time it was just a cool thing to have and Bitcoin was worth about $10/BTC so such extreme attempts were dismissed.I imagine I would likely only buy them for cold storage or as gifts. Not for actual trade. It is a simple explaination to those who believe that hoarders will cause the end of Bitcoin ("It might die to gambling"). They speak as if there will not be enough bitcoins left over because of all of the hoarders.But one does not need millions in circulation as the 1 BTC for a country's economy highlights.And by saying that one would simply just cash out your hoarded bitcoins if it reaches that high of a price kills the whole hoarding killing Bitcoin argument.  It is not very easy here in Afghanistan.Though I do not know the goat/BTC price at the moment. There are only about 20 hoarders with 99% of Bitcoins.Evil early adopters and gambling sites.
irony is having 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife Just like how the US is fine with being *bought* for 18 trillion dollars?Where does buying a country come into play? And again, a full country could have all of their capital in 1 Bitcoin and still be fine. When you earn more money than you spend, that is called profit.Where do company profits usually go?A. Paid to investorsB. Invest back in the businessC. All of the above I agree. Capitalists hate capital. What a great plan that all of these gambling companies have.1. Start gambling site.2. Hoard all of your earnings, pay for everything out of pocket.3. 4. Profit! Scientists that work for the government who have based their careers upon global warming.Governments that receive more money based upon the hype of global warming (see terrorism for military funding). There is a very low percentage of alcoholics that kick alcohol through AA. The people I believe it works for is those that value being part of a group that accepts them more than they value drinking. Kinda like people who get involved in a club or community and start to revolve their lives around doing things that will get acolades by the community, whether it is a fishing club and you make sure you make it out every morning before work to try to catch a great fish so that you can tell your community how well you did, receiving acolades and being a "big fish" within that community for your efforts. Or any number of groups where following their process makes you more welcome among the members.As for whether or not it is an addiction, I read one article that made sense. It said that many alcoholics started drinking when they were a teenager. When you drink alcohol your body treats it like a poison, your body reacts, you may get sick if you have too much, you get hung over as your body has literally been poisoned. If you do this once in a while this is no big deal, but as a teenager who's body is developing, if you repeatedly drink alcohol your body will accept that for some reason you will continue to drink this poison so your developing body changes to accept alcohol not as a poison but as something that your body will tolerate and even need. You will feel good when you drink alcohol and your body will crave it when you do not have it in your system. This is what alcoholics have to live with. People who do not have this type of body chemistry look at alcoholics as weak because they can have a couple of drinks and stop with no problem. An alcoholic has two drinks and his body has taken over and needs more and more and more, the euphoria has taken over. I have been to a few of these AA meetings with a friend and I am saddened that the meetings are not about taking control of your own body and your life but rather replacing one addiction with another. Every AA meeting will have people drowning themselves in coffee or there are the smoker's meetings where everyone is puffing away at cigarettes as they talk about how they are glad that they have their alcohol addiction under control.I do not know what the solution is, you have changed your body's chemistry while it was developing. I doubt as an adult you can do much to change it back. Your body is pretty much done developing.The best thing that can be done is to discourage kids who's bodies are still developing from drinking alcohol. Let them know that they are not just damaging their bodies in the short term but they are choosing a miserable life of being addicted to something that will control them the rest of their lives. There is money to be made in research that shows that there is global warming.I know from experience that when doing studies for the government, the first question that comes up at the meeting before the study is done is "what answer do they want?". I did simulation coding for military radio technology. They would usually come to us to see if a particular configuration of radios would have a bottle neck or if there would be coverage during a battle. With radio technology there are so many factors to simulate that you can tweak a few numbers and get very different results. Both legitimate based upon the limited ability to model every single aspect of the situation. So we tend to follow the trail that leads toward the result the customer is expecting, or as close to it as possible with plenty of data to back it up.You know how in math class you would sometimes have the answers in the back of the book but you still had to show your work. And how you would do the math question keeping the answer in mind as you go through it. That is how such research is done.If I were an environmentalist and my data showed cooling, I would go back and refine the data in a completely legitimate way until the results showed warming. Both answers would be right. Based upon the limited abstraction of the simulated data. You cannot simulate every molecule in the world, so you have to summarize large amounts of molecules in an explainable way.The key is, what answer would get me the next contract or grant. lol That sucks, I used them whenever I could for my online purchases.I wonder if there could be a good p2p way of doing this where you submit your product that you want to purchase and several people bid to fulfill the order for you using their own credit card. I have no idea what thinkprogress.org's agenda is. Ok, I am looking at the chart. Is it two separate religions or just one? Why did they stop calling it global warming and now refer to it as climate change? Will climate change combine the two religions? You know what else is just around the corner?+2 internets points for including a cat picture. I thought global cooling was the new thing. Are people still on the global warming fad?This is so confusing. Will we become less violent when the world cools down as the new fad suggests? Espiratasu itar olipartini.  Not if 1 Bitcoin is worth $1 Quadrillion.It has been stated several times that more decimal places can be added easily. Whatever your political point of view, whether we need this or that, whether the government should do something about whatever or not. Whether we should be involved in whichever thing or ignore it. It does not matter. All that matters is power.We are fooling ourselves if we believe that anything can be changed in Washington that would give power back to the people, or if that power would remain. An anarchist/libertarian society? Forget it. A communist utopia? Only if people are slaves to the masters with power.When it comes down to it, we live in an anarchist, survival of the fittest world. But when people think of such a world they think of preppers with guns killing weaker people for their supplies and surviving because they have more guns or are stronger or whichever.But the reality is that all things equal, two people are more powerful than one. So the two people have more power than that one person and can pretty much tell that one person how they should live. Unless that one person finds two other people so that it is three against two. Then they can determine what everyone should do. And on and on, the groups getting bigger, the power growing within each group. 1000 people against 500 people, the 1000 people get to decide how society works. All the way to millions of people with a huge military and nuclear weapons. How could you possibly think you can get the power back to that one person?But the thing about that is that those large groups of people join forces to protect themselves from other groups, but within the group there are groups of people with more power than the rest. So even if you do not agree with what those with more power in your group want to do, your only other option is no protection.Was our country founded on ideas alone? Or did they have more power than the British? The huge amount of effort it required for the British to send ships to America and fight a far off war caused their ideas to become the losing ideas. Not the merit of the politics, but the fact that we won the war. We displayed our power. Is democracy the best way to run a government? Is that why all of these countries are becoming democratic? Or does it have something to do with the most power country in the world flexing its muscles and pushing it on nations?In a way, libertarians in the US are fighting a far more difficult battle than if they were in some small country with a tiny military force. Your political ideology will only work if it includes a more powerful force than the current one in place. Giving power back to the people is great, as long as your political system has a way for them to all join that power together to fight a larger force. And that means, at this stage in human technological advances, being more powerful than a full on nuclear strike. And if your political ideology can do that, you need to make sure someone cannot control all of that power to take control of those that combined their power.Of course, power is not just guns and bullets. It includes money. And I believe Bitcoins can help in that piece of the puzzle. 1 Bitcoin could be the full monetary system for an entire country. "He ran him out of the store with a bar stool. He was asked if he could identify the guy and he said 'yeah, that's George.' He knew him right away,"That is awesome.
When the government is ready to attack Iran, CNN will tell you how evil the leader of Iran is and how you may die at any moment if he is not taken care of. There was once a "daylight tax" in Britain:http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/docs/window_tax.htmI know several local taxes include a rain tax. Ok...attempted character assassination...http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/07/mail-from-the-velvet-cybercrime-underground/ Crowdfunding such is no different than an individual paying for something like that.Someone still needs to execute it.Though you are onto a form of tipping the balance of power.An anonymous version of my signature would...do things. Is Iran invasion still "just around the corner"?How does it feel to live in fear? That's what it's like to be a slave. So the first Bitcoin game that uses Bitcoin is finally getting started.http://www.bitfantasy.comIt is a sort of strategy RPG game played on your browser.It costs BTC to start playing but from there on it costs nothing. But you can trade in-game objects for bitcoins.Everything in the game costs gold pieces and the shops in the game only deal in gold but the player to player market is all bitcoin based and it appears that the developers are trying to push more player to player purchases as opposed to buying things from the shops. Though it is currently in Beta so there are only a few people on there testing things out.I have been Beta testing it and it is pretty fun. It has all of the typical quest type of stuff where you can go around fighting monsters and getting goodies and experience and all of that, but they also have the ability to build farms and homes and your own Inn with the ability to make money from farming the farms and having people pay to use your Inn.I like that it is almost like a multi-player strategy game, with a bit of hack and slash thrown in. There is a good team at work making it better and I can see it growing very well once they open up for players.Let me know if you want to get in on helping with the Beta phase before they open it up to the public. Looks like Bitcoin has seen its day. This. You can be creative as you want on how you preserve the private key. Treat it like the combination to your safe. D - whammyMA - whammy Do you feed the electricity produced by the sterling engine back into the Jalapeno thus creating a perpetual mining rig?!!?? I find it extremely short sighted that people believe that the only way to pay for government services is through force.I guess that government education did not work after all. So are you saying that only tax payers (people robbed by the government) should use government services and roads?And are you ok with theft? It always comes back to "but look at all of these wonderful things you get from the money we stole".It still does not change the fact that the money is stolen."But we -need- government, so it is ok to steal." Does not change the fact that the government gets their money from theft."Don't use the government if you don't want to pay." Me not using any services does not change the stance of government stealing from me."You're a hypcrite if you use government services but hate taxes (being robbed)". That would make sense if I was asking for more services yet asking to not pay for them. As it is, most people who are against taxes are also against government spending."but...uhh...ya..but...Roads!1!!" should be paid per use (modern technology and all) True...but that's all the US economy is good for now. We don't manufacture stuff, we move numbers. There are two things that will affect profitability with ASICs from here on out. The hardware will become cheaper with economies of scale and Bitcoin price will go up.As more people get ASICs companies will crank them out like they're candy, the price will come down and the Bitcoin network will become more distributed.I imagine future company policies will crack down on people running mining thumb drives at work because most of your cost will be in the electricity required. A blade behind every grass. Does not require a military. Less than 5% of my laptop hard drive. They will go anyway. Hacking is their job. Defcon is their play time. I am working on something that could take care of this very well except it would have a precursor to Step 1.Step 0. A goal is set and bitcoin owners pledge the amount that they are willing to contribute toward that goal.Then several developers can submit proposals. A criteria will be set for taking on the proposal.Then the proposal that appears to be the best to the bitcoin owners will be voted on. If the criteria is met, the proposal is awarded.Your technical problem is solved by the software and the behavior problem is solved via escrow.I believe that the idea of people pledging toward a problem first is easier than first presenting a solution and then asking for funds. This does not apply solely to development either.See my signature for more. Go for it. No credit necessary.
$1 Heh...put those structures on floating platforms in the water and call it a seastead and you may get some good story lines out of it.  Attack by pirates, disgruntled nations, etc... You mention "in game bitcoins". It would be great if everything was real bitcoins. Your site would make money by selling the initial in-game hardware, people could trade resources in the game but you could facilitate those trades in a more efficient fashion for a small fee per trade. Sort of like charging for escrow. Bitcoin price is a good Google Trends predictor. I spend my Bitcoin.Whenever I spend that bitcoin, if the value has gone up since the time I earned that bitcoin I am required by the government to give them a cut or be kidnapped. Restitution to the victim.It was found in icelandic law that if restitution could be transferrable it helped weaker victims who could not fight for their rights to sell their rights to restitution to someone who could.Restitution was usually in the form of payments to the victim. I did not read your analysis but the red line tells me something big is about to happen! Perhaps you can work with the original author, Ayn Rand. The government does tax the bitcoins I control. It has been discussed on this forum several times. But there are fair ways of doing it. People prefer the lazy route of stealing from people though.The mafia was very efficient in getting their protection money from people. Just think of a few busted knee caps as the baloney around a dog's meds. How is buying something on the black market not legitimate? As long as someone in the world or universe is not paying their "fare share" it is an outrage to those who feed power to the government. Yes, celebrities and rich people never hire private protection because they do not work. If it were money to go toward professional private investigators as opposed to giving it to someone to fly to some city with a camera only to have someone say "no comment" then that would be the way to go. Ok. promise not to tax me if I do not use those services? I have no complaints about the government fire departments.The complaint I have is about the stealing done to pay for them. You've made a good point, that being something along the line that the 2nd is poorly worded, poorly stated or obsolete.  And that the long string of Supreme Court decisions contrary to your opinion are without merit, because you've drawn the fine line of grammar through it all.How about that...[/quote]I say again:It was not poorly worded. The intent was exercised. The revolutionaries were snuffed out. Federal control of military power was solidified.Now we have groups like the NRA fighting for our right to go hunting. Ya, I guess there are no examples of someone taking their small business and scaling it up into a huge multi national company.Sure, for providing food services it may work...but a national franchise of fire departments, using their bulk buying power to get things cheaper and reduce costs on automating processes? Impossible.And I would not consider a population of 128,000 a Norman Rockwell small town. There is a large Ron Paul community here. Those no pay no spray fire departments are poorly run. When I lived in a town with a private fire department I received a letter from the local fire department when I moved into my new house. Basically the cost was $20 per month for service or they had a per use fee, if the whole house was on fire the highest fee was $2,000. They stated that my insurance would likely cover that cost. And because the fire department had such a high rating, the highest in the state, I received a discount on my home owner's insurance that was more than the $20/month I would have paid. I opted out of paying figuring that the likelyhood of my house burning down in the next 100 months was pretty low, and my insurance would cover it anyway.I recall that same town had a private garbage service. While the county next to us had a public garbage service. There was always news of the horrors of their public garbage service while I had one problem with my garbage company (I think they charged me wrong or something) so I dropped them and went with a different garbage company.Oh, and I throw in McDonalds because I imagine that if restaurants were government run there would be people on here refusing to consider the concept of a single company having tens of thousands of restaurants all over the world. I am surprised that people would allow something as essential as the food we need for survival to be provided by private companies.
Sorta like homesteading...which was a common way of making use of the mass tracts of unused land in the west.They still have homesteading in Alaska. The original intent of the Second Amendment was lost in 1865. The following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:1709: "If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations."1714: "The practice of all well-regulated  courts of justice in the world."1812: "The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial."1848: "A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated  person will blame the Mayor."1862: "It appeared to her well-regulated  mind, like a clandestine proceeding."1894: "The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated  American embryo city."The phrase "well-regulated" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it.Of course, the fact that American conservatives usually support the Second Amendment and a standing army is quite ironic. In the US, before income taxes railroads were a private venture, roads were state tolls with fees to cross some bridges, the telephone companies quickly set up the telephone network based on the profit they were able to achieve, McDonalds restaurants were put up by private franchises, private fire departments are started by investors and charities, usually by local people that the fire department serves. My local water company was started as a water delivery service much like milk used to be delivered, it grew to the point that it could start piping water to homes until eventually everyone in the local community uses their service. My sewar company is private as well.The monuments were started mainly from the donations from societies, fraternities, clubs and individuals. Though eventually usually taken over by the government. I was involved in the Free State Project from the first year, it is not just about picking any random state. It was born out of a study that Jason Sorens did on what happened in Quebec when a small minority was able to take control of the government. He extrapolated the data to come up with the figure that you would need 20,000 activists  in a state with less than 2 million people to be able to play a major role in the state government.From there, 10 states with less than 2 million people were put up for a vote. The first 5,000 people to pledge to the Free State Project were allowed to vote for one of the 10 states.The results were:1. New Hampshire 2. Wyoming 3. Montana 4. Idaho 5. Alaska 6. Maine 7. Vermont 8. Delaware 9. South Dakota 10. North Dakota I recall Wyoming being high on many people's lists because of the large amount of natural resources and wind energy with low cost of living and cheap land. Montana was another good one because of their history of being very self reliant, their large border with Canada (allowing for easy trade if seccession ever occurred) and the vast amount of land allowing for large land purchases. People in Montana were also very welcoming of the Free Staters.It would have been interesting if they had chosen North Dakota right before the oil boom. But nobody wants to live in North Dakota. Those damned miners and their elite membership. I wish I was born into a family that was allowed to mine but I was not born with such privelidge.Only the rich can mine, with their flying country to country in their private jets sipping on the blood of extinct animals.But alas, to join such a wealthy elite is beyond us simple folk. One cannot change their stars. No rifle that has the ability to assault someone should be allowed.The only guns that should exist are the ones that cannot be used to assault. Who paid for roads before income taxes? Who paid for the monuments you see in DC? Who paid for the telephone infrastructure? Who paid for the McDonalds franchise? Who pays for private fire departments? Who pays for private water companies? My e-mail copy of it does not include the phishing link, the one on bitcointalk does. If it is anything like the US, what they call privatization is usually just a government monopoly, and changing things around to pay a private firm to do government work.It gives privatization a bad name because it never allows competition or innovation. So the old dial up telephone system was just fine because it worked? The easiest way that we could come up with a way of having mobile phones is if the state took over and controlled all of the radio waves and gave equal access to everyone and just used money gained from taxes.Same with roads. Just let the government take them over and pay for them with money from taxes.Or...privatize them.I am saddened that so many people would rather argue for taxes than spend 5 minutes thinking of an alternative to what we currently have. If everyone who said "what about the roads?" took 5 minutes to think of an alternative, we'd have some pretty kick ass solutions to take over the old outdated road system we have today.Just 1 minute...think of one possibility...let your brain work this one time... Here in the states we have a holiday on Thursday. Most people will be taking Friday off. Look for a long weekend of not much money flowing into the market.  We live in an anarchist world of survival of the fittest.It just so happens that the fittest is a collective of power that have set up rules of their liking and use their power against those who do not follow their rules. Otherwise known as government.I do not know how you can change that without another group having more power and their own set of rules take over. Which would be much the same. Septic tank. http://www.policymic.com/articles/44725/this-is-what-budget-cuts-have-done-to-detroit-and-it-s-freaking-awesomehttp://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=35http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/polin/polin017.pdfetc.. Cool story bro.And those who do not want to use the road? Whenever people think about what government provides they use these as examples.Police are paid by property taxes. There are examples of privatized police doing much better than public police.Fire departments can and are in some places privatized.Military - the notion that we need a standing army with an armed population ready to fight is a bit of a stretch. We are taught to believe we need one because we are an empirialist nation.Schools - again property taxes mainly, and also easily privatized.Roads. We are slaves to public roads that are the third highest cause of death in the US. Also could be privatized. Because the dollar kicks ass!!!Print more so we are all rich rich rich!!!
Basically the dollar is such a good investment that people are all jumping on board. I cashed out all of my stocks and bought dollars. I have also taken out a huge loan in the hopes that the dollar goes up a lot.We are all going to be rich! And yet the action is the same.If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck... This is an anarchist world of survival of the fittest. It just so happens that groups have formed to protect their own interests. These groups with the most amount of power are able to control those with less power. Those with less power can either try to fight that power which they do not stand a chance, or they can just play along under the rules of those with the power. The collapse will begin in August.The decline began in April. I flushed all of my bitcoins down the toilet.  Elwarwhatever you want to say "Currently, the largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. The Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million people"Instead of just printing words, a quick google map picture or even someone driving by and snapping a photo would lend some legitimacy to the article.Even then, the article speaks of closed down military bases with armed guards. Armed guards such as federal police to check their property every once in a while to make sure the place is free of vagrants and drifters? Taking a look at how Kant defines what is morally permissible...Kant's first formulation of the Categorical Imperative states that you are to act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law. (G 4:421) O'Neill (1975, 1989) and Rawls (1989, 1999), among others, take this formulation in effect to summarize a decision procedure for moral reasoning, and I will follow them: First, formulate a maxim that enshrines your reason for acting as you propose. Second, recast that maxim as a universal law of nature governing all rational agents, and so as holding that all must, by natural law, act as you yourself propose to act in these circumstances. Third, consider whether your maxim is even conceivable in a world governed by this law of nature. If it is, then, fourth, ask yourself whether you would, or could, rationally will to act on your maxim in such a world. If you could, then your action is morally permissible.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/So for the moral question of whether you should steal or not.1. Your reason is that you want stuff from someone else. First step passes.2. Should everyone steal?  This is where stealing falls apart...if everyone steals then the world decends into chaos. We are all doomed when people have been deprived of an American classic.Animal House My monthly spending was through the roof until I stopped factoring in the mortgage and gas. After that my spending dropped dramatically. Next month I may stop factoring in the money I spend on food and I may start seeing a huge surplus in my household. We are not doomed. Nothing is over until we decide it is. Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no! The Free State Project was launched soon after George Bush was elected.It happens every election year, libertarians think that this is the year they can get someone elected that will fix things. The electorate proves them wrong and so they look to alternatives. I think Satoshi = John Balushi's character. Interesting video, thanks.  The Federal Reserve is currently borrowing over 80% of the Treasury Bonds which are used to fund the printing of money for the Federal Reserve and rising.Meaning less than 20% of our money creation is being supported.When that hits 0% there is no place to go from there, it will mean that the world has lost all faith in the dollar.All of the hype about the dollar as of late is a fit of desperation, expect more from the government media as they try to save what is left of the failed currency. It looks like the dollar is a bubble that is about to burst.Enjoy the crash suckers. I am glad you believe that. Do not buy bitcoins at their low price. The industrial motor setting was most relevant to Ayn Rand's time and fit the book well. I could see the same meeting of the Federal Reserve where a young financer by the name of Satoshi stands up and walks out to stop the modern day motor of the US, the financial sector. Yes, I am a citizen of the United Socialist States of Amerika. Not currently living there though, nor am I sure if I will go back.Socialism is a race to the bottom. Whoever is the poorest wins. That is why I would rather be Bitcoin rich and dollar poor in the government's eyes. He has moved on to other projects unconfined by his role in Congress.
Please sir may I have another! Nice  Ya...socialism will do that.My country is currently socialist, they will be poor as well. Many people agree with you. They just hide behind labels such as taxes, concubines and fighting terror. This.Harry Browne: Set Them Free Sounds like you live in a dictatorship or socialist country.My country is full of people who believe that if the government does not pay for it, nobody will pay for it as well.But when they have to, they do.Even my garbage service is not government run. You pay a garbage service to come pick up your trash. Otherwise, you would be stuck with trash piling up in your living room. Sure, some people throw their garbage in dumpsters or even take their garbage to the dump themselves. But the convenience of only spending $10 a month to have a company come out twice a week to pick up your garbage is so much easier. This survey has shown me that I need to change professions and become a professional thief. As long as I call it a tax, many people will be ok with it.Just stand at an ATM with a gun and when someone withdraws some money hold the gun up to them and tell them that I am taxing their money. They will gladly hand over their money as a good citizen.It also stuns me about how people are ok with stealing. Which does not mean that we need to try to educate anyone, but better protect our money from being stolen. Hence, why I support Bitcoin even more. A cold storage wallet that cannot be stolen is the best way to  prevent theft of your money. If I were black back during the days of slavery I would be encouraging gun ownership and self protection from being kidnapped. This day and age of moral theft requires bitcoins. Ahh...the ability to choose.  I created the survey and I know the purpose of stealing. To get your money.Government spending is wonderful...I love getting government money, please give me more and more and more. I will take whatever the government gives me. Giving little Johnny a new kidney...that is so awesome. Give money to all countries of the world. End poverty, end homelessness. Awesome. Give it all away.Ok, now that we got the whole part about spending money being great. Which is what you focus on. I would like to at least address the act of stealing people's money.Do you believe it is ok for you to steal from me? It is a simple question, some people here have indicated that stealing is just fine. Ok, that is your own personal moral view. Ironically enough the majority  does not share your belief that stealing is fine. But to each their own, I respect your right to have your own minority opinion as a supporter of stealing. From the article:"The federal deficit is expected to fall to 4% this fiscal year, and drop to 3% by 2019"2013 total spending: $3.8 trillion2013 total revenue: $2.9 trillionDeficit: $.9 trillion = 23%You want to know how I know you are a government shill article? Considering we are about a month away from the Federal Reserve buying all of our Treasury bonds (currently buying over 80%), I am not surprised by desperation in trying to get other countries to want to buy our dollars.We are too far gone. The dollar is useless. It is not idealist, there are plenty of studies to show that people who give charitably are happier and happier people give, creating a happiness loop.If given the choice of being robbed or giving to something that you care about, which would you choose? Which do you believe would bring you more happiness? Exactly...people in the US donate more. Who has the lowest tax burden?Taxes and the government providing everything stifles charity and giving. There is an actual human need to give and it has been found that the happiest people are those that give.Government stealing from people and giving flies flat in the face of real happiness. I know on Mt Gox you have to put a zero before the decimal for anything smaller than one BTC. Source? Morality is just a matter of what is right and what is wrong.  Even children know that stealing is wrong. FTFY Years down the road people will look back at taxes and say the same thing. At least you stand by your religion of the majority committing attrocities.It explains much of what is wrong with the world. So slavery was perfectly moral?
Legal does not equal moral. Wow.What if the majority is ok with rape? Privatize the roads. We have been stuck with the same road technology for over 100 years. It is time to release the monopoly. Too many people die on the government roads and the whole road concept has stagnated.When the government turned AT&T into a monopoly in the 1930s that pretty much stalled telephone technology. Why did they create a monopoly? Same reasons people give for public roads...everyone needs access to such an important technology, poor people wouldn't be able to have phone service without it, too many phone companies would mean you could use one service but not another. They lifted the monopoly in the 1980s and things have improved dramatically ever since. The same needs to be done with roads. End the government monopoly. The question is not whether taxes are needed. It is whether or not stealing is immoral even if called something else.If you feel that stealing is necessary for society, fine...like Malcolm X saying that the ends justify the means. It is still immoral. Why not? The quiz stops once you say No. Basically tells the person why their answer makes no sense I tried to set it up so you could go back to the question but for some reason it did not work. True...they probably just see the words 'you' and 'steal' and say it is immoral no matter what. When they reach the end and see something that is societally ok, they are all for it. Awesome.Tell them to try.Then tell them, the government would have just as difficult of a time doing so as well. I find it odd that the last question gets so many No votes after Yes votes for 9.9) Would it be morally wrong for you and the majority group to designate someone to hire someone to steal from me as long as that designation was called a 'vote' and the theft was called a 'tax' or 'fine'.10) Would it be morally wrong for the majority to elect someone with their votes to hire tax agents and police to go collect taxes from me?

I do as well, there are certainly people out there who do not agree with #10 who do agree with #1.If you agree with #1 you should agree with the rest.

I was lending BTC for a while but getting around 8% return was not worth me having my bitcoins on a third party site that is located in another country that is based on software from another site that disappeared with my money.40% on LTC may get me to throw my LTC on there... I would imagine we would all change our ideologies as the forces around us change. Not that our ideology itself is changing but the relativity would be different.I would imagine that if jews in prison camps during WWII were given a political quiz they would most likely return results leaning very libertarian and anarchist, basically not liking government one bit. I doubt any jews walking to the gas chambers were complaining about whether the 10 Commandments should be displayed in a school or not.I believe that those that prefer smaller government would probably agree with each other to varying degrees of smaller government. If we were to work toward getting the government to fit inside the confines of the Constitution it is something many people would be willing to work toward. But if that did happen, then there would be some people who are satisfied with it and others who think it is a good start and would want to start picking away at the worst parts of the Constitution such as the 16th Amendment and 17th. Once those were gone many would be satisfied but still others may believe that it is still too much while others are even dissatisfied with the Constitution in the first place.The same probably goes for those who prefer more government. Many may be satisfied with socialism while others would want more and more control over their lives and move toward communism and fascism and beyond to total slavery to the state before they are truly happy. Not me.Keep up the good work gents. http://www.reddit.com/r/BitSpend/comments/1go95b/updatenews_why_we_have_been_slow_and_taking/This sucks. I was shopping online and wanted to buy something. I don't carry my debit card with me any more because I usually just use bitcoins via BitSpend.I think the solution to this is a decentralized BitSpend type of service. Have a p2p app, you sign up as a willing purchaser...someone enters a link to the product they want to buy, you submit your offer to buy it for them for BTC...based on your rating they go ahead and send you the BTC, you purchase it and have it shipped to the buyer.The key issue there would be the trust factor unless third party escrows could also be coded in. Entertaining the whole shuffling of chairs on the titanic seems fairly pointless. Should kids in government schools be allowed to do X or Y, should public libraries ban this or that, should speed limits on government roads be raised or lowered...When is the last time there was any great debate whether or not McDonalds should bring back the McRib or whether Starbucks should call their large drinks a large?Privatize the roads. QED Pennies an hour? Any decent disabled web developers out there? I would put them to work, they could compete against the Indians and Chinese that only charge a few dollars an hour. And when the government that does not like what we are doing on one of their islands sends police and military, what should we do?
It would not be until the police strip searched me and found my private key tattooed on my penis that they would have access to my bitcoins. That is why they call them your "privates". Nice of them to include Google advertisements in their legal document. This rewards innovators...watching Bitcoin I have seen more and more reason why patents are not as necessary as one would think. You get in early with an idea and you are rewarded heavily for quite a while. But then competition moves in and everyone benefits. Some whiners think that ASICs are centralizing everything because they cannot buy one and make a buttload of coins.But ASICs are the end of the line for hardware advances up until quantum computing, and even then it is so far away and it would be years before the return on the processing power of a quantum computer could match an ASIC.As it is, several companies are popping up to provide ASIC chips. And they are looking to mass produce these things. Meaning a future of millions of cheap ASICs to be used primarily for mining bitcoins. N00bs will be able to buy an ASIC on Amazon and have it delivered in a few days to be plugged in and run with very little knowledge of mining. Unlike GPU mining or even CPU mining.This may not be the case right now, but after a year or so there will be tons of ASICs out there. They may even be embedded in other electronics like TV boxes that pay for TV shows via bitcoins mined from your ASIC chip. All you pay is electricity costs. Or free cell phones with embedded ASIC to pay for your service, just make sure you keep it charged.The only way to speed things up through hardware is just to have more ASICs. There is no next step for a long time. In middle of nowhere, far from civilization and comfortable living.Plus it is likely that OP lives near there or owns the site, hence the location.  I have looked into island rentals. They would cost much more than the 30 BTC being collected. BitFinex gives yearly returns of around 8% APR compounded hourly.The risk is that BitFinex not disappear. Umm...it would be worse than having a camera on every street corner tracking us. Umm...can we say central video database of every video being taken by police with facial recognition software? You make the mistake in assuming we want the current system to continue. If 210,000,000,000,000 Satoshis is not enough for the world economy to handle, they will start using mSatoshis.As for deflation.Ever bought a computer?Why did you not wait so that your dollar would increase in comparison with the computer technology? 100 BTC could take care of the full money supply of an entire country if it got popular enough. Easily. Low price is good.We are all early adopters now. Based upon the combination of all of the above analysis I have bought heavily into PPCoin. I have been pulled over at least a dozen times. I got a speeding ticket once with no passenger.I was in a Porsche flying down the highway late for my flight. I can usually get out of it because I have a very young, innocent face and I pull the "I've never had a ticket before officer" with puppy dog look.Does not work with red light cameras. I got one of those, I am not sure I was even driving. This. Previous thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=85483.0 A small sample of quotes from FinShaggy from the other thread. (for the $2 million land purchase)tl;dr   They are now taking pre-orders for the Trezor bitcoin hardware wallet.http://www.coindesk.com/trezor-now-taking-pre-orders-for-its-hardware-bitcoin-wallet/What do you think? Would you buy one? 1 BTC for a plastic case version in November or 3 BTC for aluminum in October.I am undecided on it. It could be one of those things that I did not know I needed until I use it, but am still unsure. I use paper wallets for long term storage and online wallets for short term spending money. A hardware wallet would be handy as a replacement for using online wallets.
Do not buy bitcoins at the current low price. This: Combination 'B' and 'live long and prosper'. Girl's slumber party right before the pillow fight breaks out? But this is where it will end up. Since there is not much more that can be done technology wise, in order to be competitive it's all about producing as many as possible at the cheapest cost. did you say its the love of money  thats the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of moneyand he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it. Let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it. Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one anothertheir only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun. But money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being richwill not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guiltand of his life, as he deserves. Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standardthe men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted moneythe men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-lawmen who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victimsthen money becomes its creators avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once theyve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter. Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a societys virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsionwhen you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothingwhen you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favorswhen you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws dont protect you against them, but protect them against youwhen you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrificeyou may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that is does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot. Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is mens protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, Account overdrawn. When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, Who is destroying the world? You are. You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why its crumbling around you, while youre damning its life-bloodmoney. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout mens history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slavesslaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebodys mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepersas industrialists. To the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a country of moneyand I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, mans mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human beingthe self-made manthe American industrialist. If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choosebecause it contains all the othersthe fact that they were the people who created the phrase to make money. No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantityto be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words to make money hold the essence of human morality. Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters continents. Now the looters credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide as, I think, he will. Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and gunsor dollars. Take your choicethere is no otherand your time is running out. http://capitalismmagazine.com/2002/08/franciscos-money-speech/ Just be happy that there is no new technology beyond ASICs for a long time.   Are we talking about the ones in office or terrorists? I am not saying that governments are inevitable, but that there has to be something in place for each person to be protected from the formation of power greater than them.The wild west is a great example of no government but a culture built upon self reliance and self defense. Being good with your gun was common, carrying guns was common. The wife and kids at home knowing how to shoot a rifle or shotgun was common. It was common for a reason. They also had the ability to raise a posse and organize spontaneously as people were more grounded and knew everyone in town, so going up against one person was going up against the whole town if you were being predatory.In Iceland they had a great form of electing people to represent them in a competitive way and organize protection against other groups. It worked well until something more powerful, the Catholic church, came along and tipped the balance.The absense of government will not necessarily create government but it will at least be replaced by people cooperating with one another in a way to best increase their ability to protect themselves. If everyone has equal power then the golden rule is a given, it is in both of their best interests to do so. With an unequal balance of power the one with the power gets to decide if the golden rule is followed, our US government has demonstrated that it does not need to follow that rule against those that are weaker. Welcome to the forums.Search button is located in the top right. That is what I was talking about when talking about you and your friends having enough power to make the power of the other moot. Call them friends, call them paid security or whichever. The statement of an anarchist world goes along the lines of being born with inalienable rights. That is just something you are born with, everything from there on is thrust upon you such as the prisons, taxes, borders, etc.But in a world of survival of the fittest, those that organize their protection win out. It just so happens that this has happened. The US government has amassed great power, and they are more fit than me or you in this world of survival of the fittest.That is why I am saying that just like in the world of currencies, the Federal Reserve has reigned as the ruler of money in the US. The solution is not to end the Fed or destroy the dollar. But to build an alternative that is better. I believe that is also the best way forward when dealing with governments. Not to try to end them or bring them down, but to create a better alternative based on voluntary decentralized power.In such a way that the 18 year old scenario would be more like this:You leave home at 18 taking along a bottle of champagne to the local park. You go to take a drink and a guy stops you.At that point you face a choice. Are you more powerful than that dude? Can you continue drinking without him interfering? You may be bigger so you stand up to him telling him that you are a free person that can do whatever he wants. The dude disagrees and pulls a gun. He tells you that the park was created by the Conservative Prohibition Club and one of their rules for the park is that nobody can drink alcohol on their property. He tells you that he belongs to their security force, CPC security and that he has jurisdiction on all property belonging to that club. But he tells you that the Liberty Alliance has a park just down the road that allows drinking whatever you want. They have a Liberty Alliance security force that is just as powerful as the CPC security so they leave each other alone, besides both security forces get partial funding from the Stop the Violence Association who's explicit goal is to prevent security forces that they fund from interfering with one another or face the loss of funding. You move along to the Liberty Alliance park and enjoy a good drink with like minded people. The IBM technology is software based, not hardware based. It decentralizes the computations at a software program level so that you can run the program spread out over many machines. This works really well for feeding data through it in real time and not having any bottle necks. I used to work for IBM and took a class on how to use their Watson technology.As for mining, saying that this is something to worry about would be like saying that we should worry about them using 100-1000 computers using CPUs to do a 51% attack.But when I took the class they mentioned that they were able to feed all of the data of the Internet through the thing in 2 weeks. They tried to see how much data could break it in a simulation and their data producing engines could not create data fast enough to overwhelm it. Well archy means: a combining form meaning rule, government,.So anarchy would be without rule or government. Basically nobody ruling over you. Chaos implies confusion or disorder. That is not what I am saying would happen without people being ruled. The only chaos would be from the perception of someone who wishes to rule people. But there can be order without being ruled. You play a game of pool and though there are rules, nobody is ruling over the players. The rules are agreed upon by the two players beforehand and followed.  For those who supported Mitt Romney, do you really believe that he would have done anything differently when it comes to the NSA and gathering information on every American to help "fight the war on terror"?Your choice was not in November 2012, it was in winter & spring 2012. Did you choose the guy who would have put an end to the spying? You speak of GPU miners as though they would be making big money today if it were not for FPGAs and ASICs.The reality is that back in the day CPU miners were complaining in the same way that people who can afford to buy expensive GPU cards had an unfair advantage and were taking away the decentralization of Bitcoin. That anyone should be able to just turn on their money and start making money.Back then, the investment in a $1,000-$2,000 graphics card may net you $1,500 to $2,000 worth of bitcoins. Sometimes people lost money on mining.Then FPGAs come along and outpace the GPUs. These cost more and the return is slightly more because the Bitcoin price has gone up a bit more. Then ASICs come along and they cost more and the return is again slightly more because the Bitcoin price has gone up a bit more. But the percentage has remained fairly constant no matter which hardware has been used.But the thing here is, there is a large chasm between the fastest hardware available today for mining and the next level (quantum computing). We are in the early adopter phase of ASICs. Several companies are working to mass produce these by the hundreds of thousands.In the future you will be able to order an ASIC at a much lower cost and have it shipped out within days. Hell, just before quantum computing comes out you may be able to go to your local Best Buy or Walmart and buy a Bitcoin ASIC miner next to the roku boxes.The more people that are able to use these ASICs will mean that the difficulty will be higher and the payout will not be as high as it is today, but the price will be higher so more than likely there may be a return similar to what people have received before. But the key is that they will become even more decentralized. There is no "next" technology to pool money for like the ASICs that will give you an advantage over everyone else. If you are a physics major your best way forward would be to look into quantum computing and focus on that because I guarantee that once Bitcoin takes off, the sprint will be to be the first to come online with a quantum miner. But the technological leap will be years in between so we will be able to enjoy cheap ASICs for quite some time.They key to the faster technologies is that the faster they are, the more secure Bitcoin will be, and the worries of a 51% attack by any outside entity will be a thing of the past. Hmm, I got the grid two spaces in front of the location of the capitol which is where the street is. But not directly in the location.Oops...maybe someone will sill give me 10k for it.  You have to confirm your e-mail. The fact that he believed Obama's promises shows that he is not all that smart.He will be caught.
The next Final Fantasy will not be made for Xbox as well.  I have the US Capitol. Has the White House been claimed yet? No online fee for PS4 to play Netflix, games do not require Internet connection but if you want to play online games it's $50 (not sure of time frame). http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ps4-vs-xbox-one-sony-and-microsoft-headtohead-at-e3-games-expo-2013-8654333.htmlYou can pre-order at the Sony website. Which will you be getting this Christmas?Also, does anyone know if there would be a procedure to get in as a business to bulk order several hundred of these so we could pool our money to get a shot of the first run of deliveries?  If so, that would be one of the first trials for my BitPools site. Good for you gurcani.I find it disgusting how much our media is a tool of the government. During the Egyptian riots they considered it an uprising to take over the government and covered it like there was good chance for an overthrow of the government.For this one they talk about the difficulty the Turkish government is facing against these protesters. The problem was not the FAA, during their trial run of delivering tacos they used Predator drones and shot the tacos at people...this did not work well. The more secure the algorithms make Bitcoin, the more benefit for humanity we receive. Bitcoin, more transparent than the Federal Reserve. This needs to happen.http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/22560500/sushi-restaurant-using-unmanned-flying-drones-to-deliver-food-to-customers#axzz2VvJhjKWBSomeone needs to set up an app that can send bitcoins and GPS information to a restaurant and have a drone with food come and find you. They mentioned that they may have to use some pass-throughs but that they would try to avoid them as much as possible.I think one of the big difficulties will be buying gas.I also wonder why it is always people who have "never used bitcoin before" that try to live their lives using only bitcoin.Why not get to know how to use it first? I believe the key thing in thinking about this is that if we get rid of government, it will create a vaccuum to be filled by more centralized power to control our lives.What needs to happen is to do like Bitcoin and create a decentralized alternative first.Voluntarism/Agorism may be such an answer. Watson Why not?Ever heard of unit cost averaging? I guess using the word "society" is poor wording. We are born into an anarchist world...but we join an "archist" society once we give in to following the rules of the archy because of their power. No elevators... If there is one thing governments need is...more money.  mmmm...GMO corn and chili powder... Bitcoins will make you fertile.
Pretty much...and the commercials and advice that I see about just ignoring bullies does not seem like it would work. We all follow orders our whole lives. The first time you are told not to do something that a free man would do, and you change your actions to do so...you have just followed orders to stifle freedom. Even if it is only your own.I'm not a soldier so I cannot speak for them, I do this solely for the money. I wish the US citizens would vote me out of a job but they just keep wanting to give me more money so who am I to disagree. But the response a soldier always gives is not that they are fighting for their country but for their buddy next to them. They get plopped into bad situations by idiots and have to fight to protect themselves and their buddies.The US has not been attacked since Pearl Harbor and that was after we forced Japan's hand. Just think of the decades of prosperity we would have if we only attacked those countries that attacked or threatened to attack us? If you're paranoid, pour that military spending into research...we could've had sharks with lasers by now...nobody would mess with us.Afghanis do not even know how to use a toilet, only 20% can read at a basic level...there was no scenario where Afghanistan was going to take over the US. At first I was outraged...$200k working for Booz Allen in Hawaii!!!  Then I saw the end:$200k makes sense. So does that mean his position is open? Do you often worry about things that will happen in 130 years? The beauty of having a ship in International waters is that you can hire international workers that will work for less than minimum wage and be making much more than they would have back home.I offered my services with setting up the computers and network but realized that likely they will likely hire several foreigners that will get paid what I would be asking. Part of the reason I do not offer my services on freelancer. I have always wanted to visit Australasia. Just an example. You could go out into the world as soon as you can walk and the example still applies but starting with a 2 year old that can push you down to older kids up to your parents, the police, military, etc... When you are born you can do whatever you want. When you leave your home at 18 you can do whatever you want. Right now you can do whatever you want.If you leave your home at 18 years old and go decide you want to celebrate with a glass of champagne in the park. You grab a bottle from home and head down to the park. You pop the cork and sit there enjoying your freedom from the parents.Then some dude comes up and tells you he does not like you drinking.At that point you face a choice. Are you more powerful than that dude? Can you continue drinking without him interfering? You may be bigger so you stand up to him telling him that you are a free person that can do whatever he wants. The dude disagrees and pulls a gun. In this anarchist world, survival of the fittest prevails. You are subject to that person's whim because he has more power than you do. He can now use his gun to take you prisoner for as long as he and his friends think is right in their own eyes.What if you had a gun too? If he pulled a gun you could have pulled one too, perhaps shot him if neccessary. But then he has a bunch of buddies with guns too, and a lot of equipment to come track you down and take you to a cage and hold you there as long as he and his friends think is right in their own eyes.What if you and your buddies had more guns and equipment than them? Then their buddies would call other buddies who have tanks and helicopters and jets and missiles...So, what if you had a lot of buddies with tanks and helicopters and jets and missiles...once it was established that interfering with you was not worth all of the lives and fighting, then...then you could sit there and drink your champagne freely.So when it comes down to it...we are all free. It is just that there are people out there that hold more power than us that will always have control over our lives unless we are more powerful than them. That is an anarchist society. Here is an article about it...I believe the source requires a paid subscription.http://lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi261.html I stopped buying once things leveled out and am paying off credit cards...makes it so I can buy more bitcoins each month with each card that's paid off. My guess would be one of those big million dollar investors from the bubble time is tired of seeing his money sitting in something that is not bringing a large return. So they moved on to something else. Speak for yourself. The Federal Reserve is currently buying 73% of Treasury Notes, which are used to print money for the Federal Reserve who turns around and buys 74% of Treasury Notes which are used to print money for the Federal Reserve who turns around and buys 75% of Treasury Notes...etc...It is estimated that at the current rate, the Federal Reserve will be buying 100% of Treasury Notes by mid July.What this means is that no other country is willing to buy our debt. The only way our debt can be funded at that point is from printing money. Printing enough money to fund our government means the value of our currency will go down by that much on a daily basis.It will not be pretty.Even if the Federal Reserve stops buying our Treasury Notes...we only have 27% of the customers we used to have. In order to entice the other 73% into buying we have to sell cheap. Or jack up the interest paid on our debt. Bahamas. Looks like you're trying to talk yourself into this one.I do not think any words of warning will be helpful here. Just do not risk more than you are willing to lose. And the dude has a total of 1 post on there. Best return I have received on safe investments on my bitcoin has been 20% yearly return. And I considered it high risk because my bitcoins were under the control of somebody else (who can disappear at any time with your money).1% a day sounds like a ponzi scheme and I would not be surprised if it goes away after a couple of months (if not days). At least you are not buying dollars with your bitcoins.My prediction is that by August the dollar will be half the value it is today. Though it may take some time for that value drop to be noticed as it spreads throughout the economy. But it will be felt. It appears that the price on most of the exchanges is within around a dollar of each other. This is a good thing. Hopefully volume spreads well to the exchanges. I was going to go with CampBX but on their FAQ they list USPS and Western Union wire transfers but not banks. Which exchanges accept bank wire transfers? (Besides MtGox).
"You're all terrorists...."your mom's a terrorist...BOOM I would put all of my money into Justin Bieber's record company. There is no stopping the Biebs. I believe they were referring to the brother being in a coma for a long time. When I set up a project I get bids on the project. Once the project begins I am required to pass the correct amount of funds to Freelancer. I set up milestones for the developer with amounts of money to be released each milestone. And I have full control over releasing those funds. It is not until the project is completed that I release the final funds.  I assume that if the project is completed and the developer proves to Freelancer that the project is complete, then Freelancer would release the funds if sufficient evidence proves it. Kinda like e-bay.So there is not much risk of someone scamming you out of your money. I doubt that there are many things you would be able to get from the CIA that would be unclassified.At the very least it would be Unclassified FOUO (For official use only). Which is akin to a corporate document that is only allowed to be viewed by people within that corporation. Just the mere fact that the CIA took some news story on Bitcoin and sent that story on makes it FOUO because the knowledge that they are looking into such information is not for outside eyes.The term "can neither confirm nor deny" is supposed to be used for just about anything when it comes to information about what may or may not be going on in your facility. Or just tell your SSO.Of course he will likely tell you to fill out some form online Then you have to disclose that travel for the next 10 years on all future clearance paperwork. I have sent an e-mail to Freelancer.com requesting that they accept bitcoins considering they serve nations all over the world and have to convert currencies all the time in order to pay people. Being able to pay someone or get paid in bitcoins would be a great step forward for people to be able to get off of their government currencies.Please contact them and let them know how useful it would be to be able to get paid in bitcoins or to pay people in bitcoins.http://www.freelancer.com/info/contact-us.phpI do realize that there have been bitcoin services similar to freelancer in the past but the amount of projects or developers is fairly sparse.And if freelancer accepted bitcoins, you could point anyone who wanted to make a few BTC to that site with so many ways to make money.Edit:The canned response I received was:  This is the end of bitcoin. Sell it all. The cheaper the better...for reasons I can only explain in a few banking days. Could we take the peanut allergy debate to another thread? The guy just lost his kid brother, he has some hard days ahead of him. I work on a military base in Afghanistan. We get bombs lobbed at us about every other day.We know that there is not much to worry about because statistically, you are not likely to get hit.The US has been hit by terrorist attacks what...once every 10 years or so (maybe once every 5 years in the UK)? In a population of hundreds of millions?Statistically terrorism should not even be a glimmer of a miniscule thought on your mind.Unfortunately, statistically I am more likely to get raped out here than hit by a bomb. That is something I do worry about. I drove a Porsche 911 and had to finally get rid of it because of the cost of repairs.It is not that it is unreliable, it is that the mechanics know you can afford to pay out the a$$. And they are few and far between in a small town with not many Porsches.Lamborghini is probably similar. You would be paying for a vehicle to drive to go out for the evening, but keep a commuter car.I would buy a Tesla for that much money. They kick ass. Get a bunch of Cascius coins in a large tower. Create a diving board and dive in.   Nokia 101I know you are jealous. lol  Sorry to hear that man. It is the worst feeling in the world to lose a loved one. Just remember the good times and always keep him in your heart.The only thing that can help is time. Already underway.http://galtsgulchchile.com/ It is already underway.BlueSeed OP had to duplicate threads because people called him out too much in his other thread on how bad his idea is.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=216139.0 (for the $2 million land purchase)tl;dr two fitty
Sounds like we need a Mechanical Turk for bitcoin.Design and implement one and I will pay you .05 BTC.  Where did Napolean keep his armies? Quite cool...I had this idea a while back and wondered why nobody was doing it.Interesting enough, BitSpend got blocked from buying from Amazon for doing a pass through from Bitcoin to Amazon purchases.This may be a good solution having it more decentralized.You could easily do what BitSpend does in a p2p way like this for all websites. Just cut the profit with the buyers.I would help test but I do not have a prime account. And I cannot think of anything I need on Amazon very soon. In one small part of the world.Bitcoin is global. As long as my debit card still works. Or I can go to an ATM and get my money out of the bank I will be fine. When Bitcoin is worth a million dollars I plan on using mine to buy a loaf of bread.   If you have the password to my account you can read all of the dirty PMs I have back and forth with all of the Bitcoin ladies...those alone would be worth dozens of bitcoins on Silk Road. Their best solution would be to court the Bitcoin Foundation with promises of main player status in world currency decisions. In exchange, the Bitcoin Foundation would need to reserve a good chunk of bitcoins for currency manipulation.Or they could call the Winklevoss twins... I recall seeing another dude on here with a similar proposal and the person behind OP's account seemed interested. https://bitcointalk.org He posted a full article's length of information on Facebook? Sure.I agree with the sentiment that you are just trying to make it look like you have a friend. Buy 100 BTC...then do that... Yes.  When will AbcCoin be ready for mining? If you have about 100 BTC you can loan them out to speculators on BitFinex.Edit: it would take about a week to get .05 BTC though. Bitcoins. And bears.You cannot set up a decent mining rig with bears around. Check out Freight Farmshttp://freightfarms.com/A farm in a freight container.
Ever been to the lending subforum here on bitcointalk? There are many "verbal" agreements to loan money that end up with someone skipping out.What is done then?And how many people are willing to accept a verbal agreement with a user with only 10 posts asking to borrow 1000 BTC? It is because humans are greedy/'seek reward' and avoid pain/work that anarchy/libertarianism is the most productive system for humans.I am fine with communists' belief that if we simply change humans to not seek reward (be greedy) and humans are ok with pain (work) then their system will work. In theory it could be true.But I disagree that human nature can be changed.Communists trying to change human nature to make economics work is like Victorians trying to change human nature to make their moral view of sex work. Why would you want to buy dollars? Women's menstual blood attracts sharks...do we really want women to have bitcoins knowing this? Perhaps Bitcoin can make it easier to get marriage out of the government's hands.That way at least marriage could be equal.By getting marriage out of government's hands, I mean two people having a contractual relationship for their monetary relationship (ie replacing the marriage "license") with things like multi sig encryption where the two people control the money. Disarm. This.Do you seriously believe that the phone apps are 10GB? I would rather have a million US dollars worth of Zimbabwe dollars!That's like 100 trillion dollars! I would be so rich. Looks like there is a door on the side toward the rear. Ya, I think about that image...Luckily I work at an airport and there are commercial airlines here...money would talk.Otherwise I am screwed. Difficulty drives price in that it is an upper buffer for price.If the difficulty was the same tomorrow and the price skyrockets to $10,000/BTC you would be faced with a decision.Do I go out and buy $2,000 worth of hardware which would get me around 10-20 BTC over the life of the hardware (at current difficulty), or put $2,000 into buying .2 BTC right now.You would likely go out and buy the hardware instead of trading bitcoins at the exchange.But most people would do this so difficulty would then skyrocket to eventually meet the price.But with so many people moving from trading to mining, the price would likely come down to the point where people would be more willing to trade than to mine.So there is at least some correlation, they are not decoupled. As for the best place...I am not sure if being here with the military in Afghanistan is the best place to be. They would likely pull the troops back to "secure" things back home. They would likely not care about protecting things over here anymore leaving us vulnerable.But the government will pour money into protecting themselves before anything else so being in front of that fire hose will help me financially as long as I continue to just convert my paychecks to bitcoins.But when I get back to the US I am looking at three options. BlueSeed, New Hampshire or going mobile. The May 28 Daily Treasury Statement shows that the US Treasury has an operating cash balance of ~$16 billion which is roughly one day's average cash outlay of about $17 billion. That same statement showed that we are $25 Million shy of the new debt ceiling.Since the onset of Expanded QE3, the Fed has monetized 73% of Net Public Treasury Debt Issuance, should hit 100% by Mid-July if it continues at this pace, as the Fed has indicated it will continue into the summer.The US government can't control foreign holders of US IOUs (US Treasury Bonds) who have a growing perception they will never be paid back on the trillions of dollars of debt owed them. Foreign holders of US Treasury bills can sell them off at a loss to others.  The amount those T-bonds are discounted is the amount the US dollar will be valued at in the world marketplace. At that point, the US faces a default on its obligations to pay back lenders. The fact that people want the price to drop in order to buy is not an indication that it will be dropping any time soon.In 2011 the sentiment was that Bitcoin was likely to fail but those of us who support the concept were willing to put our money in on faith that it may just survive.When the price was $3 most people were predicting a drop to less than a dollar. So buying at the $2 low was not the wise choice of the time.Of course thinking back, I put $10k in in 2010 when the price was $15/BTC...had I put that in at $2 I would be sitting pretty right now. Then again, I may have held off thinking it would go to $1.As it is, I did a huge short when it bounced back up to $4 after the $2 dip. It fell down to $3.75 then climbed and climbed... You are welcome. No it's not...don't buy coins for a few days...it will go lower, honest. It will crash to 2 cents per BTC before jumping up to $10,000/BTC.Anyone buying at $30-$40 is a sucker. Welcome to the forum. Perhaps you missed the Newbie README:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=177133.0 I used to consistently pour my paychecks into bitcoin via MtGox every two weeks. I have yet to decide on my next exchange. I am sure many others have moved to other exchanges.I am focussing on paying down a few credit cards while I figure out the best place to exchange my money. I believe Apple had a lot of their stuff in Ireland.
I would be fine with this non-taxing government that issued its own inflating currency.As long as I am not forced to use their currency. Now this is what I am talking about... http://blockchain.info/q/addressbalance/1ELWAR1qFQbfmpMhcsTaBniFRLewrYqGo2 As much as he pushes DevCoin he should be creating a DevCoin town. Oh, and I watched one of your later videos 20 or 21 and it was just you talking. Saying stuff that could have been easily posted. There were 5 views.Is there really a reason to post videos to read text? Not everyone is always in a position online where they can watch videos with sound (ie work, at home with family, Starbucks, etc). The funny thing is, I would have been one of your biggest advocates if your plan for this town was simply:We will be pooling our money to buy a large piece of land to start a town. Each person will get a share of the land in proportion to what they put in and the currency of the town will be bitcoins. Other than that, if you have other projects you want to do on your own...that is fine but this project will be focussed on the very difficult task of bringing enough people in to make this work and all of the difficulties that will go along with it.Do you know the promises and goals of the very successful Free State Project are? As it is, I have $10k I could plop down on such a simple thing as a Bitcoin town. I have invested that much in the past on such a venture and am currently looking for such a project.As it stands right now I am looking at 3 options when I leave Afghanistan. 1. Project BlueSeed. 2. Grafton, NH. 3. Van dwelling in a sportsmobile living wherever I want. And that is the whole point behind locking down the currency claiming they care about money laundering because of terrorists and drug dealers.It is all about getting their cut. There are all of these rules and laws about "money laundering" to make it sound so scary and evil like Scarface moving his dirty money.But what is money laundering anyway? Someone commits a crime involving money and does not want that money traced back to them for that crime, so they launder the money. So essentially, these are monetary crimes. And since the law enforcement cannot solve the crime or catch the "bad guys" they have to lock down the whole monetary system just in case "bad" money makes it through.So because some people may use money for bad things and they are too incompetent to catch them, the government must know every transaction that anyone ever makes with money?Why stop there? Why not have ID checks at every corner of every city of every country so that if a crime happens on one street they can trace the crime by knowing who was on that street at that time? Oh, but those of us who would be against that would be "supporting terrorists" or drug dealers and criminals.Sure, if someone steals money from someone else it would be nice to track that money down. But is it worth locking down a whole currency because of it? Me at a Chinese massage parlor. A shape. Sure I do, I wish them the best of luck. But with the lack of purpose and just anger, they will end up just like Occupy Wall Street.If it were a CIA operation, the work would already be going on behind the scenes to turn the protest into a government take-over. Like Egypt and Iran in '78. Not angry, just supportive of the idea but not when the creator's answers to everything is "yes, we will give you that too". It turns a good idea into a non-feasible idea.And when most people think Bitcoin town with no government and no taxes they think of a libertarian/ancap town. Not a commune. Dog I sent you .002 BTC from the address: 1Primep7DMN8qCtByac7L29ntRjd7X3KCL A ring. Alex Trebek Redistribute all of the wealth today and in 10 years we will be exactly where we were yesterday. If the US is behind it like in Egypt then the government will fall. Otherwise it will survive. Dreams come true all the time, just not for the dreamers" - Eoin Colfer This. Bill Gates thinking tomorrow that it would be good to have a million bitcoins is not considering any trendlines.Gavin deciding tomorrow that he has enough bitcoins to pay off the mortgage on his house is not following trendlines.
That would limit me to buying something locally. That limits my choices. And your $500,000 to 'help bitcoin' would only help local people in your area to be able to purchase food with bitcoins.Hell, even FinShaggy asked for $2 million and in exchange for your $10k investment you got a piece of land, a house, computer and a TV. I actually bought some organic dog food for my dogs with bitcoins last month.It did not raise the price of bitcoin one bit. Ya, that is the whole point of venture capital. They invest in your company early on when your company is in the early stages so that they can get a large share of your business so that if your business is successful they will get big returns. Almost like mining or buying bitcoins in the early stages so that the share is larger if it takes off.It is a speculative gamble of buying low, hoarding your shares and then selling high.So you want money to spend on something so that we can all benefit from the existence of your business? How kind of you.I can buy food with bitcoins in several places. Amazon, Burger King, Applebees, Sams Club, etc. CtrlAltBernanke420: Hi, I need half a million dollars to start an organic farm so I can sell food to people.Bank: Ok, what is your business plan?

Can you show proof of past history that would justify the returns you expect to be able to pay back $500,000?or...CtrlAltBernanke420: Hi, I need 3850 bitcoins to start an organic farm so I can sell food to people in exchange for bitcoins!Bitcoin investor: Ok, what is your business plan? What will you use as collateral? What is your farming experience? How many other successful businesses do you have? Would you be willing to put down 20% (770BTC) toward the loan? Let me check your credit score and credit history. What is your current salary? Can you show proof of past history that would justify the returns you expect to be able to pay back 3850 bitcoins?CtrlAltBernanke420: I will pay you $6/BTC for 3850 bitcoins. Well, when it comes down to it...if you are choosing between buying BTC now or paying for a rig that will cost you $90/BTC you have to remember that by the time you get your mining hardware the difficulty will be a lot higher and the cost could be over $130/BTC. I personally will not order an ASIC because by the time I get it the return on my investment may be lower than if I just buy BTC now. What is a "black guy"? The actual cost of producing a bitcoin is currently around $90/BTC and climbing as more ASICs hit the market.https://blockchain.info/stats Thank you for adding the 420 in your name. It took me a while to realize that FinShaggy's ramblings were just that of a stoner with wild dreams not grounded in reality.Bitcoin will fail because you want someone to fund your dream of growing organic tofu and nobody is going to give you BTC for $4/BTC. Damn greedy miners.You do not need $500,000 for a farm to feed 100 people. Start small with a garden in your back yard and create a CSA subscription at http://www.localharvest.org and only take bitcoins for member payments. Upon success, buy a larger lot and continue to grow.Or sit in your basement getting stoned.I fully support people's choice to smoke pot, but I do not have to support the insanity that comes with it. In the dreams of little british boys with tuppence for a bag of bird food. There should be a limit of only 10 new alt coins per day. Any more than that and the whole alt coin concept becomes rediculous. qft Manipulating alt coin prices are easy. Dropping $1k in there is usually enough to move things the way you want. The fact that people are wanting to mine a currency who's only difference from Bitcoin is an extra 'r' is pretty bad.Especially a "british" coin, pre-mined with 2 million coins to an American.lol Only 2 million coins pre-mined. Everything else is the same as Bitcoin except the additional "r".Enjoy mining.http://www.github.com/project/britcoinThese things are going to be worth lots of pounds! Tell them that your fee will be in bitcoins once you help them learn how to get them. If I have learned anything from Alex Jones it is that the best way to deal with the Bilderberg group is to stand outside of their meetings with a magaphone and yell at them.It satisfies those that are upset, enough to think that something has been done and the group inside can feel secure that the crowd outside has been appeased. I would at least post it on your facebook page.Personally, I could care less about mass adoption. People will adopt it eventually out of necessity so the longer they stay with their government money, the longer I get to buy bitcoins at a low price.But I do feel like I should at least post something on my Facebook page for my friends and family telling them that if they want any help in understanding the complexities of bitcoin to hit me up. I already did this with my immediate family and just got the responses of "if I had any money I would buy some but I'm broke". Which is fine. I at least gave them the chance. I told them all about it when the price was $15/BTC and my brother just responded with an article about how some senator wanted to crack down on bitcoin. I reminded them again when it was around $110 and climbing. Umm, how is that nearing the area above it? The trend line keeps going up and the price is over $100 away from catching up.Looking at the long term trend from early bitcoin to today would indicate we are just about at the right price being in the low 100s. The bubble action was fun but it appears that we have returned to where we would have been without the spike. Which is healthy.The lack of volatility will be a self fulfilling prophecy in that we will have less wild swings because the day traders are sidelined at the moment. At least the people who think they are day traders because they got a couple of good gambles while the price was flying all over the place. Volume should go down and we will return to business as usual.Now people need to focus on creating Bitcoin businesses to make money instead of trying to gamble. Which will help the price in the long run.A good 5-10% per month rise will be about right. Though as the volume falls, you will be able to see the big money movers come in once in a while and throw things one way or the other on their own terms. The site in my Sig cannot be done with government currency unless people willingly provide access to their bank account information. And even then it would be clunky. That is certainly true. Obama is opening the wound wider.At this point, I believe that is about the best thing we can hope for the US. The quicker the better.
Jesus walked for many years before finding his first apostille. It appears that they have selected the cruise ship:http://technode.com/2013/05/23/blueseed-ready-to-charter-a-cruise-ship-to-accommodate-more-than-1000-entrepreneurs/ There have been no candidates in the general election in the past decade that would have done anything about it. Even if Rand Paul were elected in 2016, I believe it is too late. By no means is the trouble we are in due to Obama. It was well on its way before Obama was even elected (the financial crisis happening toward the end of Bush's second term).I do agree though, combining the following:The unfunded liabilities of the state health insurance system amount to more than $ 38 trillion for the next 75 years.The state pension system has a funding gap of USD 134 trillion over the next 75 years.The national debt being $16.7 trillion.That means that of the 143 million people in the US that pay taxes each year, they are on the hook for over $1.3 million to the government during their lifetime. Just for those 3 alone, not including yearly budgets. That is an average of $28k per year for every working American for their whole working life, not including the taxes to pay that year's budget.A country such as Costa Rica, however, has a balanced budget law which does not allow them to have any debt. So their citizens are only on the hook for the budget they pass that particular year.The best the US can hope to do is make the current dollar worth about .001 cents in today's value. That is the only thing that can save them. That is why I can see $10k/BTC in a few years. Jim Rogers has had some great quotes. "A fool and his money are soon elected." "Americans will feed anyone that's not close to them." "Our foreign policy is an open booka checkbook." "I belong to no organized party, I'm a Democrat." "Lettin' the cat out of the bag is a lot easier than puttin' it back in." "When the Okies left Oklahoma and moved to California, they raised the average intelligence level in both states." "People who fly into a rage always make a bad landing." "If there are no dogs in Heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went." "The income tax has made more liars out of Americans than golf. Just wondering if there are any betting sites where your odds get better the higher your bet.Say a 50:50 game with house edge of 2% for a 1 BTC bet while it is closer to 1% for a 10 BTC bet or .1% for 100 BTC bet.I only know of SatoshiDICE and do not gamble so this is more research than anything. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=220395.0;topicseen I have sold two things on BitMit at a fixed price.I sold a pair of socks for 1 BTC and a pair of boots for 14 BTC. Maybe now people will use the money they were using to buy/sell to just buy and use Bitcoin as a currency. I clicked on that link and got hacked.Thanks a lot dude. I thought the verification process has been standard for a long time.I had to go through it last summer to pull some money out. What if someone uses a credit card to import some expensive bottles of wine for their wine collection and someone else holds onto a few bitcoin until the value is high enough to where they can buy a car for commuting to work?Buying a car now or buying a car in a year will eventually even out as far as the economy is concerned. The fact is, not everyone is switching over from fiat to bitcoin all at once, so the guy who may have purchased something with a credit card now will instead buy that same thing in a year with bitcoin.The key is, the credit card company will not get 17% of the value of the purchase just for making the purchase more convenient. 17% worth of productivity spent on some people working in an office moving numbers that could otherwise be adding to the economy in a more productive way.This thread is to highlight the argument by keynsians that if you have a deflationary currency, you would never spend it because if you spend it, you lose on the gain in value you could have had from holding it. The same thing with compound interest (as Einstein said, the greatest force in nature is compound interest). The argument falls flat on its face if your savings is paying out 4% and there is only 1% inflation. Why spend when your money is gaining value? As we can see from history, spending was quite common in years with high interest savings."when people expect falling prices, they become less willing to spend, and in particular less willing to borrow" -Paul Krugman Yep, I lobbied myrkul for special treatment to get a task force. That is the part of the game that is missing (bribes).So it is in your best interest to not steal from me.Plus I lojacked all of my goods. Too much focus is going on moving money back and forth between new currency and old currency.More focus needed on using the new currency. This is my public decree on how I deal with thieves.If you steal from me, as an eye for an eye, the next round I will attempt to retrieve my stolen goods by sending in a special task force to steal my points back.If you choose trade during that round, I will return to trading with you and we will move on with a clean slate.If you choose steal again, I will continue to send my task force in every round until you choose trade. Apparently most people are ok with stealing from other people. Especially if they can convince themselves that taking money from unwilling participants is not theft if the thief has a funny hat on his head. I was in a bank and this teenager was there with his parents. One of the bank ladies was pushing him to get a credit card or debit card (ever since the bank became Wells Fargo they have been pushing credit cards hard). He said he just uses cash. She talked about how he could lose his cash or it could get stolen and if it was a credit card the bank would be able to get his money back if it was stolen.Pretty sad really...like tobacco sales marketing towards kids. It is hard to compete with free government services but I can see people willing to pay for quality.On second thought, my open source idea would probably be hijacked by those government services that already provide it. If you have 100 people and someone comes up with a proposal that requires 100 BTC and people put in 1 BTC each then 51 votes will only result in 51 BTC and the proposal will fail.If you have 100 people and the proposal is for 50 BTC at 1 BTC per vote and you get 51 votes, then the proposal passes and those 51 people are now part of a new group that is in charge of moving the proposal forward. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agricultureCheck here to see if you have a local farm that supports a subscription based food purchase:http://www.localharvest.org/organic-farms/If you can convince your local farmer to accept bitcoins, you are all set.I checked this out at one point in my area. I found an organic farm that charged something around $150/month (or maybe that was per week) for membership. With membership you were able to go to the farm weekly and pick up a few bags of fresh vegetables and rabbit meat (their specialty) and at times they would have other meat from the few animals they had on the farm. What you get that week depended upon what they harvested that week. It was a pretty decent deal and they gave me a tour of the farm (they charged $10 for tours) to show what types of food they grow and how they grow it. They had some hydroponics, a very good system of raising rabbits and using their droppings to help with fertilization. All quite interesting. In the end, my wife was not up for it. Although she likes meat, she loves animals and if she actually sees the animals that will eventually become meat...she would not be able to eat it. And I am not big on vegetables and that was mainly what they provided so we declined. They actually had a waiting list of people though (since they would only allow for so many people to be members since there is only so much food).Another local farm I found had organically fed cattle. You could subscribe to that and get a full, half, quarter cattle once every few months. I asked to be put on that waiting list but never heard back.
Here is an insurance company that accepts bitcoins.http://www.bmins.com/bitcoin.html Then tell them that all grades will be distributed evenly to all kids. If 10 kids get an A and 10 kids get a B and 10 kids get a C, then everyone will get a B. If only 5 kids get an A, 10 kids get a B and 15 kids get a C then everyone will get a B-.See how long those A students will continue to study and work hard. In about a week you will be able to test something very similar to that. See my sig. "Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealththe man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it."http://capitalismmagazine.com/2002/08/franciscos-money-speech/ How is one defined as "elist snobs"? My answer.I have no bitcoins.(on me) In other news.Mark Zuckerburg dumps $1 billion into LiteCoin. Uncertainty at the quantum level is just because there is not enough knowledge yet to explain everything. Not that I am saying there will eventually be that knowledge, but there is likely an explanation behind it beyond our current understanding.Just like how the rain gods produced rain. It was uncertain exactly which ritual most pleased them. How long until D-wave (http://www.dwavesys.com/en/dw_homepage.html) mining is obsolete?Such rudimentary quantum technology. The way you present it, there can be no irrationality because there is a reason for everything anyone does. The neurons have a path that they traverse and there is a reason that such a path exists. If you get down to the most microscopic level everything can be explained.This would counter the Jurassic Park explaination of Chaos Theory where the guy takes a drop of water and drips it onto the girl's hand stating that the path the water takes cannot be predicted becauase Chaos Theory dictates that in complex systems, the outcome will be different every time. But by your definition, knowledge of every particle, every skin cell, the size of the water droplet, the slightest shift in air particles during the drop means that there is a rational explaination for the water going one way or another. While this is true, most people look at things from a more broad level and not at a microscopic level.In theory, if you knew the exact position and velocity and direction of every micro-particle in the universe you would be able to predict everything that would ever occur from there on out. But that would take a lot of ASICs to do the calculations. Yes, I have seen that you plan on planting a garden and creating some fuel from corn. And the billions you will make from writing for Devcoins that you get 1 per 1000 words which are worth about a penny each.Why even ask for $10,000 from people in the first place? Why not just create all of your wealth through mining and distilling and writing for Devcoins and buy the property yourself. Then just give people plots for free. I mean, a house, computer, TV, free printing and publishing, welfare for citizens and veterans, non-traditional education...that is probably much more than $10k per person, plus your private island, radio studio, university, radio studio, bus fleet, restaurant, state of the art medical facility, hatchery, man made lake, church, government paid salaried church employees, etc...that surely comes out to at least a few billion dollars. $2 million is just a drop in the bucket. You have the fundraising for all of this all figured out. Just throw in free plots too. Hell, I am sure people would be fine with just half a plot for free...that is only $5,000. Maybe they would forgo the free computer and TV in exchange.Or are you planning on making the people of the town work and not get paid for their labor? Ahh, from the way you talk it sounds like you have several billion dollars. So all of this free stuff you plan on giving away will need to be produced by the people that move to your town. Have you ever considered running for Congress? You get a house, a free computer and a free TV. For $10,000. You are quite generous with your large wealth. Are you broke right now because you just gave away Teslas to a whole neighborhood or something? So everyone gets a free house?I read earlier in this thread that in order to share in the communcal food everyone has to work. I assumed that was for housing too.Can you give me a free house even if I do not move there? What if someone is poor and handicapped and cannot work for their home? Are you going to violate the Americans with Disabilities Act? That is a different person from the OP. Your whole theory falls apart thanks to this:andQED Ahh, that makes sense. Which would be the reason MtGox, a Japanese company, ran into legal trouble serving US customers on the government currency side of things.Thanks. Of course, because I am not seeking legal advice from you on a public forum. I am just asking for a general sense.Like all of these bitcoin gambling websites, certainly if they were running in the United States there would eventually be legal hurdles to deal with but if they choose another country to run their servers are they safe, even as legal citizens.As someone who is opening up a website that could potentially put a powerful dent in government itself (my sig), I have considered ways of bipassing the meddlesome US government and the potential destruction that it tends to do to businesses that do not have 24/7 lobbyists in DC. So, considering you are in good company in the United States thinking that regulation is a good thing. Would it be wise for bitcoin businesses to completely bipass the United States if they do not have to deal in government money? Say, like moving the website to the Bahamas and set up a corporation down there. Or would that bring some legal risk to the owner if they were a US citizen?
I agree, the economy will collapse and anyone holding government money is going to be severely hurt.If only there was another currency that would not be affected by such a collapse that we could move to. Not true at all.-Elwar's personal forum poster Predition:If FinShaggy does not instead to move onto is next project after Bitcoin town, which came after Bitcoin church, which came after Bitcoin reality show, which came after Bitcoin restaurant, which came after Devcoin talking animals project while putting together the Bitcoin island project before the Bitcoin space project and the Bitcoin nation on another planet project...FinShaggy will take a weekend trip down to New Mexico and take some pictures of some empty property. He will speak in terms of "we" a lot, even though it is just him and his bong. He will try and try to get that first person to fork over their $10k, but the suckers that do not see this for what it is do not have the money and those that do have money would never trust someone like FinShaggy with their real estate investment. He will come to the great realization that if you do not have the money you can just give him what you can and work off the rest when you get there. This money will fund his next project which will tie directly into the Bitcoin town, really. More than likely a new strain of Bitcoin weed that the Bitcoin town will grow. Of course, much testing needs to be done first.I was part of a much more popular project in New Hampshire where we had over 50 people willing to put $10k toward about 10 acres each. We had someone on the ground spending countless weekends checking locations for us, working on all of the legal requirements, formed a corporation, worked with lawyers, his dad did large real estate investments for a living and he was being trained to do the same, having just graduated starting his career. We had narrowed it down to 2 or 3 properties when the call for us to start following through with our pledges, all of the legal paperwork was faxed out to those that were willing to invest, everything was handled transparently, a treasury report was provided, some money was spent on the formation of the corporation and other legal documents that were also viewable by anyone.Unfortunately, those 50 loud voices demanding various things and talking about their big plans turned out to be all talk. Only 3 of us (including the guy putting in all of the legwork) put up our $10k. After a few months of nobody else putting up anything he posed an option to the two of us for another investment or just return the money. I requested my money back and the other guy opted for the investment. A few hundred bucks was trimmed off for all of the legal stuff that was paid for which I agreed to and we all moved on.All of this and there were not even grandiose promises of free stuff for everyone. Everyone was free to do what they want and if a few people wanted to come together for other projects it was up to them.You will find that people online are all talk. And when it comes time to put up the money, they do not have it.How many people posting in this thread that support this idea even have an extra $10k to invest? $10k that could be used to put a downpayment on an actual house that you could actually live in instead of $10k for an empty lot that you will be living in a tent on (forgetting the whole idea of having a job to buy food, pay for phone, Internet, car insurance, gas, saving up to actually build a home, etc.). Banks do not give out loans for land btw. Everyone can join FinShaggy in his town by heading here: tor://silkroad.com I worked on military "mesh networks", otherwise known as ad-hoc wireless networks. We were working with stationary blimps to help with line of site issues in mountainous regions (in conjunction with UAVs). I only worked on simulations though. If you go to the border of Mexico (Fort Huachuca) and also out here in the Middle East you will see blimps up in the air...I am not sure if they are just for recon or if they also have routers in them. Hmm, about the only thing that I ever hear libertarians saying that the government needs to prevent is force and fraud.Can someone be ripped off without fraud? What kind of sports stadiums will it have?Will we be trying to attract visitors by having a professional sports team? And I propose an alternative song:The rotten bones are trembling, Of the World before the War. We have smashed this terror, For us a great victory.We will continue to march, Even if everything shatters; Because today FinShaggy hears us, And tomorrow, the whole World.And lies in ruins from battle The World lies in ruins, But devil may care; We build it up again. And the elders may chide, So just let them scream and cry, And if the World decides to fight us, We will still be the victors. They don't want to understand this song, They think of slavery and war. Meanwhile our acres ripen, Flag of freedom, fly!We will continue march, Even if everything shatters; Freedom rose in FinShaggyland, And tomorrow the world belongs to it. In FinShaggyland we vote on everything.1 vote for red FinShaggyland flag0 vote for white Bitrustica flag In FinShaggyland you do not need a government because everything is free!And for anything else, it is voted on and enforced by a police squad. And no government in sight! Except you have to get permission first from the mayor if you want to do something with your land. And you cannot build your house above a certain height or the non-government will send the police squad. And the school, which will not be run by the government, will be non-traditional without lectures but dirt bikes will be made legal. It will all be spelled out in the town's constitution. I propose this as the flag.The big star represents FinShaggy and the four little stars represent the four lucky people that get to be co-founders.5 votes in all so that one person (hopefully FinShaggy) can be a tie breaker. How did I know. Why stop at a town and an island. Space is where it is at. You should definitely have a launching site in town to take you up to the space colony. Town name should be FinShaggyland. Awesome!So here are a few suggestions:Computers...everyone should have one no matter how poor. TVs too. The town should have its own channel to push the town philosophy.Exercise programs in the town square every morning.Children could play a great role helping out the community, even if just telling on their parents if they do not follow township rules.We could have a town founder day and celebrate at the non-denominational church with statues and offerings.Free health care should be a priority. It should be known that if you have any illness or sickness, this town is where you should be to get healed. Val Kilmner lives in New Mexico, will you be contacting him to join us? What will be done for the poor?Should big corporations like Exxon and Monsanto be allowed to build businesses there?Will there be a way to prevent people from polluting the air? Or preventing light pollution or sound pollution?With no taxes, how will garbage service get paid for? Water service? Sewage? Fire department, hospital, ambulance service, street lights, etc?If someone does not have a car that runs on biodiesel, what can be done for them? The only places in the water that are outside of any nation's exclusive economic zone (where the country still has control) are at depths of several miles deep with waves that can reach over 100 feet.To try to think that you can create an island by dumping a bunch of stuff is just insanity.Ellis Island which was created in water at a depth of several feet was created using the dirt from all of New York City's subway system.To create an island that big in the ocean would require millions of tons of dirt, you would have to dig a second Grand Canyon to do so.You have these "grand schemes" that other people have already taken on and are working on and you just act like it is no problem and you just need to create some videos and it will get done.The Seasteading Institute has been working on this for almost 10 years with millions of dollars in funding and research. And they are at least 10 years and over $200 million away from building a real seasted while BlueSeed is a few million dollars away.Do you think that if they could build an island they would not have done so already?Hell, even the young guy that I worked with to do a large land purchase in New Hampshire knew enough to know that we would need to form a corporation in order to have several people share ownership of the property and he was being coached by his father who did such purchases for a living.You just want everyone to give you some money then you will buy it and promise to split it up afterwards. It just does not work that way. I cannot believe I fell into the troll's trap.Well played sir. Before anyone thinks that FinShaggy's Bitcoin town idea is in any way libertarian, read this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=216139.msg2269803#msg2269803
Is part of your plan to raise $200,000 by getting people to watch your countless Utoob videos? Ok, once again...good luck with your commune. Just be careful not to publicize this as New Mexico is hostile toward such efforts.In 2003 Clay Douglas of The Free American was trying to organize a "patriots' village" in an abandoned mining town in southwestern New Mexico. When the government got wind of it, the local Senator Pete Domenici arranged for the town to be taken over by the feds to use for "counter-terrorism training." So you will be funding the public land that will create enough money to fund a communal fund that could potentially be used to buy solar panels, FPGAs, ASICs, an island, a fleet of busses, etc?How many millions of dollars are you going to be paid in June?Or do you have a scheme in mind on how to get a couple of million really quick? The Federal Reserve has been around for a century, it took a lot for people to even find out what the Federal Reserve is much less that it should be ended. All of our fighting to get even an audit of the Federal Reserve took two presidential elections with that as the main focus to get a watered down bill passed. The audit showed that they were pouring money to foreign governments and still there is no glimmer in anyone's eyes of getting the Federal Reserve shut down via Congress.Bitcoin is creating an alternative. It is doing more to the Federal Reserve than has been done in 100 years. We can tell that they are intimidated because they are starting to use their tools to try to stop Bitcoin (The Fed's biggest tool though, besides the media, is war...so do not get too comfortable).Instead of ending the Fed we are creating a better alternative and bipassing the Federal Reserve. Potentially, this could lead to the end of the Fed as the better alternative wins out.Could this be the path forward for other government services? Create a streamlined, open source, distributed service for all communities? Take fire departments for example. I lived in a county where the fire department was private. They provided the best award winning service of the whole state and every home owner received a discount on their insurance rates because of that fire department. The cost was either $20 a month or a maximum $2,000 for putting out a house fire (which was also covered by insurance).If we were to take the standard operating procedures of this successful fire department combined with mass purchases to cut down on costs and other streamlining procedures we could probably get that same service offered in many more communities at a lower cost. The towns where they are set up may already have a city fire department but if people are willing to be covered by the new fire department their insurance may go down more than the price per month making adoption easy. And with a fully operational fire department in town, come budget time the town leaders may be more apt to not pay to keep their old fire department going.And that is just one service that could be replaced.The key is to have the alternative already available to people before talking about getting rid of the government service. So my 1/200th investment would not result in getting 1/200th of the land? So this small community would share the solar panels, ASICs and other such possessions?Would the the work and income from such pursuits go toward the communal fund?Such a lifestyle sounds quite unconventional. Step 1: 200 people each put in $10,000 to buy the $2 million property.Step 2: Anyone can rent their land to earn money or sell it.Step 3: ? ? ?Step 4: We have some communal money for Earthships, solar power, super solid internet connection, FPGAs and ASICs. When you exchange your bitcoins for something of value you have to pay capital gains taxes on the gain in value from when you first obtained the bitcoins to the time of purchase. So how do you get communal town funds? Would I be required to contribute toward the communcal town funds? So, no communal town funds?Your quote just says that in your commune people have to work if they want the commune food. Will the "communal work and living, for people that can't afford any other way of sustaining life" be part of the town constitution that you write? Sounds like a commune to me. Your words, not mine.You should check out Vermont, there is a very big commune/hippy mindset up there. Plus they are right next to New Hampshire where Bitcoin is thriving in the live free or die state. I think we all understand your philosophy by now.Enjoy your commune. You say "we" are trying to live freely yet you are already setting up plenty of rules and are sounding a bit dictatorish. The majority can be dangerous to those who do not agree when police can use force against the minority.FYI, I have gone down this road before. I helped to get Grafton, NH chosen for the Free Town and put up $10k toward a piece of land much the same way you are proposing. It is not as easy as it seems. Sounds like you are creating a town like any other town but a small difference being that they accept bitcoins among the 200 people.Why not just move to Berlin?Or wait a year when you can use your bitcoin debit card anywhere.You went from having a government that is only a service to police that will throw people in jail if they do not do things the majority agree with.You may want to move this thread to a blog on your computer that you read yourself.Or better yet:http://www.simcity.com/ They already use the terrorism scare to justify their regulations. This is what you should expect when you first get to New Mexico with a large group of outsiders:http://premium1.fosters.com/2004/news/june2004/june_20_04/sports/ap_nh0620a.aspI also recall that during that meeting local townpeople were going out to the car lot to check license plates to see what states these outsiders were coming from so that they could raise more opposition to these outsiders coming to their town trying to change things. And most recently:Those opposing the Free Stater takeover appear to be winning. On town meeting day, Grafton voters rejected drastic budget cuts and a tax cap proposal. They approved warrant articles authorizing additional spending  to buy a new police vehicle and tow truck, pave roads and make improvements to the towns fire and ambulance building.http://miscellanyblue.com/post/47135072156Do not underestimate local people who have been there their whole lives fighting outsiders coming in trying to change things. Even if you think it is for their own benefit. Some people like lots of government. If your current money is in a bank gaining interest, why would you ever spend your money? Is this a flaw in fiat? Everyone is hoarding their money to get interest on their money so nobody is spending their money. Should we penalize money that has been sitting in the bank too long?If nobody spends their money fiat will become useless. What are some ways we can get people to spend fiat instead of hoarding it for the interest? In reality people in the USA support socialism. They just do not know that that is the word for what they like (and continue to vote for).
I predicted $266 by the weekend. So my prediction was only half right.$532 by next weekend. Wow...for no government you sure do have a long laundry list of things you want the community to do.Maybe it is better for you to start it outside of New Hampshire.The whole key to successes of the Free State (they have a long way to go) is the idea of having libertarians spread around the country trying to have any political influence has time and time again failed. By focussing on one state they are able to go from being spread out to having more power coming together in one place.There have been countless efforts at free towns, free counties, etc...all failed. It is usually started by someone who wants other liberty thinkers to come to their town because they need help fighting off all of the statists. That is the case in all parts of the country. Your situation is not unique. New Mexico is nice and all but they are fairly statist themselves. Gary Johnson made some big improvements there but their Democrat governor worked on undoing most of his accomplishments. Even in a free town, you would have to put up with state laws and federal laws. At least in New Hampshire there is already an effort to hold back the growing force of the state laws. And nullify as many federal laws as possible (national ID card, seatbelt laws, etc.).If large tracts of cheap land is what you are after, a group tried to create a free town in west Texas after the 2008 election. http://paulville.org/  They purchased the land and I believe set up septic and electric lines. There was a free county project that was tried in Colorado and the attempt to buy the Belle Isle island from Detroit http://www.commonwealthofbelleisle.com/ There has been a lot of work done in New Hampshire with the Free State Project. They are very Bitcoin friendly up there. Trying to choose a different state would be pointless. They even have people in the state government fighting for liberty. Free Keene is a group of very active people in Keene. The Free Town Project chose Grafton as a place to move if you wanted to be in a town of liberty lovers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton,_New_Hampshire The telephone industry was a government created monopoly for 50 years, an agreement between the US government and AT&T and the local Bell phone companies.In 1984 they loosened things up a bit and then in the mid 90s they deregulated it.Look at how much the phone technology changed between 1952 and 1984. Then look at the mild advances between the mid 80s and 90s, then look at the changes between the mid 90s and today.Those who would have telephones still regulated would say that it is easier to keep all of the phone systems compatible with just one system. There were literally people warning about the need to have one phone line in your home for every phone company if the monopoly was lifted. They would warn about how many businesses rely on their telephones and if this "great experiment" were to fail that all of those businesses would be affected and the economy could potentially be devastated. And, of course, if one phone company was not around and required to offer service to the poorest people then only rich people would be able to afford phones and the poor would have their phones turned off, the phone companies would only serve the wealthy communities. So you are basically putting the idea into statists minds that they need to regulate doughnuts.For years I have been reveling in the fact that they are unregulated, enjoying all varieties of tasty goodness. Now some pencil pushing beaurocrat is going to start regulating the size, shape, price and taste of doughnuts.Thanks a lot. This is all anyone needs to read before going on with this thread. (for the $2 million land purchase)tl;dr Kill/trade game is dangerous. With the services being built around Bitcoin, I could easily see people using Bitcoin without even knowing that they are doing so.Maybe a website where you buy "points" and you are able to buy things with those points but in reality you are buying mBTC and the site is paying merchants in bitcoins.Or a bitcoin card that does everything on the back end in bitcoin but the user does not necessarily refer to it as Bitcoin.Maybe major financial institutions will start moving large amounts of money back and forth via Bitcoin for its compatability and ease of transfer.If that happened, how do you think the price would be affected? The right to pursue happiness is implied with the right to liberty. That wording was a comprimise in the Declaration of Independence from its original Life, Liberty and Property. Bitcoin helps with liberty in that you are able to live free economically. With government money that is not the case. Not any time soon. $133...half way there! So some people can not pay taxes and use government services and not be considered thieves and other people can not pay taxes and use government services and be considered thieves?Are those people forcing the government at the point of a gun to provide those services? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_and_Elaine_BrownApril 2007  On April 24, U.S. District Judge Steven McAuliffe sentences Ed and Elaine Brown to five years and three months in prison each for concealing earnings and failing to pay federal income tax  on nearly $2 million of income. Neither of the Browns appeared in court for the sentencing.May 2007  On May 18, Ed and Elaine Brown are reported as stating they do not intend to appeal their convictions on federal tax evasion charges. They said they have abandoned "man's law" and now follow only the rules and laws put forth in the Bible. June 2007  On June 7, police, SWAT teams, and armored vehicles are seen gathering in a field near the Browns' home. United States Marshal Stephen Monier confirms that one Brown supporter was detained near the Browns' property. Several sources later identify the Browns' supporter as a man named Danny Riley, and state that he was detained while walking the Browns' dog, Zoe. Monier's office later releases a press statement indicating that the government agents were not raiding the Browns' home, but were in the area to serve a warrant for the seizure of Elaine Brown's dental office in West Lebanon, New Hampshire. (Subsequent testimony at trial revealed that this operation was in fact an arrest attempt.) In the evening of June 7, Riley records a video describing his encounter with and detainment by federal agents earlier that day. In the video Riley claims that one camouflaged agent fired two shots over his head after he fled from the agent once happening upon him hiding in the woods near the Browns' property. Riley claims that after being tackled and tasered, he was threatened with 15 years in jail by the FBI unless he told the media that the siege was expected and planned for, and was not the outcome of an abortive attempt to serve a warrant.[  Unicorns are real if you just believe. Based on the fact that Bitcoin will be worth $10,000 by Monday I went and told my boss he can take this stinkin job and shove it where the boys at the gym shove it. I then threw my computer through the window and kicked it when I got outside on the way to my car.Early retirement baby! If you make a line from its northernmost side and extend directly southward through the southernmost point it runs through Key West.Most likely has something to do with cheeseburgers in paradise. Woo hoo!!! USA! USA! USA! The drug war does more to fund terrorism than anything Bitcoin could ever do. Only 20% of Afghanistan men can read. Do you really think they are using Bitcoin? I live among them, they do not even know how to use a toilet properly let alone a crypto currency. Whoever is telling you that all of these restrictions they are putting on Americans' freedoms is to help stop terrorists is blowing a lot of smoke up your ass. Tell that to Ed and Elaine Brown who tried to live peacefully and free but because they did not pay taxes were survailed by SWAT teams and police for weeks for not paying taxes and then finally attacked. And when they chose to defend themselves (as a free person will do when attacked) they had more charges thrown against them and are now in jail for life.Or Irwin Schiff who had all of his property seized and was taken away to jail after being in front of a judge who said "I will not allow evidence in my court room".They take you to jail.Do not ever claim that America is the land of the free as long as people cannot live free without being kidnapped and held prisoner. Just spending bitcoins incurs a tax when the value goes up compared to the dollar, no employment required. And just because a government has its rules of theft if you perform your daily activities does not mean that you consent to the theft by performing your daily activities. We are born with inherent rights to life and liberty.
Merely living does not imply consent to be robbed.Please do take away all government services, including the SEC, DEA, CIA, IRS, DHS, FBI, FDA, EPA, NSA, TSA, DOT, CPS, Foreign Aid, bank bailouts, automobile bailouts, welfare, warfare, and everything else.Are you saying that anyone  who does not pay taxes and still uses government services is a thief? I have noticed that the Financial Times always posts negative articles about Bitcoin. "Why you should fear Bitcoin", "Bitcoin won't last...", etc.. True, I had not thought about people who's addresses have been emptied. But that is a gamble on how long it will be before someone has BTC in that account.Though all that gives you is access to a group through your pledge. But that is a good thought, maybe a requirement of verifying your address within a few days of registering would be good. There is not much point in registering if you do not plan on joining a group. I have considered the different types of illegal activity that such a service could be used for.I do know that the terms of service need to be concrete to avoid most litigation. I will likely add that the use of the site cannot be used to initate force against anyone. Just as a community can pool their money to build a park, they could pool their money to hire a security team (police) to enforce some bad laws. Non-initiation of force covers most bad things people can do to each other. But it certainly needs to be hashed out.Though in theory, people can do all of this coordination outside of the website but they could also pool their money together outside of the site as well so I doubt they would come there just to do the final stage of pooling their money if they are already coordinating outside of the site. Also, if it was all coded messages and such they could do the same with any crowdfunding site calling a bomb an "algae farm" or whichever.And the proposals will come from escrow services which will be viewable, if someone creates the proposal of assassinating someone (or any use of force) it can be easily pulled before a vote goes through. And most escrow services will be vetted, mainly for the sake of the users that the money will be transferred to someone trustworthy. I would like to move it more and more toward decentralization and anonymous as the concept becomes more hashed out. But starting out, I think the concept is so new that there will be some growing pains as we all gain a learning experience from this. I am no Satoshi  Peace, trade, and honest friendship with all users  entangling alliances with none. BitSpendhttps://bitspend.net I like the avatar I created for my alt account. It makes it more convincing right? I mean, if I did not set myself up so easily I would not be able to post such fun posts. I am just stating a fact. Theft is theft. It is understandable if you are ok with stealing to pay for "society", you are in good company with most Americans.Political action? You mean like when I ran for Congress or was a state delegate in Texas?Leave? Done. It is 8:30AM right now where I live (time to go get some breakfast).And how do oppressive regimes oppress? Through the initiation of force. Same offense, different scale. If you lived in North Korea you would be raving about all of the wonderful things that great leader gives his citizens while ignoring the theft. Costa Rica has a few of these free trade zones where a business can set up there and they are free from some of the tarriffs and quotas. Basically they have to follow most of the laws but they are given a waiver on several of the financial laws. They are usually set up in economically underdeveloped areas where they want to stimulate the economy. Since Costa Rica has a high import tax people go to these areas and stock up on big ticket purchases without needing to pay the high tax.If that is what the OP is talking about, it would be ok and all...just not a free zone. lolI should start packing now. Do you bring your old stuff with you or just buy new stuff when moving to your private island? When someone takes money away from someone else without their consent, that is stealing.Slavery and the initiation of force against humans is disgusting. People will look back at our current time in history with the same disgust.Relying on theft for your goods and services because it is accepted is just plain lazy and immoral. Anyone who gave it just a bit of thought could figure out that it is not the only way. Now we are getting somewhere...irrational exhuberance!Do I hear $1,000? The whole point of Bitcoin is change. Change you can certainly believe in this time around.Anyone working toward its free, unadultered, use is working to free humanity from such oppression. If I do not like theft I should ask the thieves to let me be one of them so that I can tell them to stop stealing?Slavery was common in the US until 1886. It was accepted, and common.According to you, the slaves should have just run for office and changed the law.Or, people would eventually realize that slavery was bad and outlaw it.That is all well and good for history, but if you are a slave you are stuck waiting for the uninformed masses to start acting morally.So what do you do? You escape, you find the underground railroad, you do whatever you can do to be free in a society that thinks you should be a slave.Bitcoin is our underground railroad. Those that still believe in slavery are working to shut it down. Under the guise of "creating laws and regulations to prevent criminals and terrorists from laundering money".  Just because some people vote for theft does not make it any less theft. The act is still theft, what is done with the loot afterwards does not change the act. There are many discussion on this.I believe one of the solutions was to tell your family members half of the private key and then leave the other half in your will.Or have it on an object that you wear. Hmm, so it would basically be a monetary (BTC) award for the person who uses bitcoin to best help humanity?That would make a good test of the BitPools project in my sig. I should have it open for beta testing in about 2-3 weeks. Wow...it went up a dollar...$266 by the weekend? Well the system perpetuates it. Politicians take money so they can spread their message in a favorable way. You cannot blame politicians for taking money, the system allows it so the output will trend toward them chasing the money. You cannot blame the citizens who try to get as much out of the system because the system allows it and the output will trend toward them chasing the money and voting for politicians that will reward them. You cannot blame the lobbyists since they are rewarded for supplying money to the politicians who will use the power of the government to favor them. The system allows it.The one step in there that can be blamed is the use of force against people to gain money and power (at the point of the gun under threat of being kidnapped and held prisoner). That is the problem with the system.
Most civil and criminal laws are not valid concepts.They are mainly the initiation of force against people who have not themselves initiated force. I think Silk Road will do more for getting rid of gang violence than anything the police could ever do. Should. But they do not. They vote for the guy they think can win during the primaries then vote for the lesser of two evils in the general election.(A scarier thought is that the people elected are actually what people want)Well, now you know. And knowing is half the battle.  Ahh, I was thinking you were talking about bitcoin laws. Yes, I doubt the adoption rate is very high though it would be a good thing to use in Costa Rica since they have an inflationary currency and many locals do not even use that currency. If you are country shopping for freedom I have done quite a bit of research.My final conclusion was Costa Rica though the Bahamas is more free. But the Bahamas are more expensive.Though there is one kick ass country in asia where the political process involves politicians rising in public office based upon the amount of parties they throw. There is certain criteria to each party including a roasted pig among other things. Me. This has been discussed thoroughly at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=154672.180The fact that they refer to currency refers to government currency (This is a limitation of 31 USC § 5312 (a)(3)). Value that substitutes for currency would be other "monetary instruments" that they are allowed to regulate under section 5311 et seq: travelers checks, bearer negotiable instruments, bearer investment securities, bearer securities, stock on which title is passed on delivery, and similar material. Bitcoin comes into play when discussing "virtual currency".Basically it says that FinCEN comes into play if you are dealing with government currency. I made sure to check on this when the guidance first came out. I agree, I have programmers working on the front end but have been testing the back end with API calls. I hope to open up for Beta testing in 2 weeks.As far as money transmission, since I will not be dealing in government money I will not need to be licensed. Bitcoins can be moved by anyone (every Bitcoin node on the network moves bitcoins). By not working, do you get anything on the screen? It uses javascript. There should be no functionality of any of the pages yet.An address does not show up on the blockchain until there is a balance. So you would have to know what address someone may one day use (out of billions of possible addresses). Or if he was good he could steal the hardware. This post for sale for 5 BTC. Whoa...so, in theory, you can have a zero balance bank account and whenever you go to buy something you load your debit card with just enough to pay the bill by paying with Bitcoins...correct?And someone can just write up a program to quickly exchange dollars for bitcoins just for that purpose...Bitcoin debit card...Or is there still a delay? Yes.The Church of Satoshi and Latter Day Coins https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=122239.0 Curious, are the Chinese articles supporting Bitcoin geared toward Chinese citizens or foreigners? Like with Russia Today. This. Repeatedly. Well there was the Mitt Romney blackmail thing back in 2012.http://bitcoinmagazine.com/mitt-romney-blackmailed-for-bitcoins/ Ya, nobody wants to borrow my BTC to short when the price is not moving.It may crash any second, borrow at a high interest rate while you still can! Outside of Bitcoin, how often do you switch back and forth between currencies?There is this image portrayed of Bitcoin that involves hopping back and forth between your main currency and Bitcoin.But how many people hop between currencies in their daily lives outside of professionals that deal with that sort of thing all of the time.If I had to hop back and forth between the Peso and the dollar I would have many of the same arguments about volatility and the inconvenience of it. We need to get past the mindset of buying and selling Bitcoin and move toward one time conversion of your old government currency to your new currency, to be held and used on its own.Do people in Mexico care much about something like this going on weekly? Satoshi's white paper:
Nice, I will have to check more into Bitmessage.Does it require a client on your machine, or can it be done online? I like Evorhees's software that allows for both parties to send money to one address (in this case only one party) where a third party has control of which person gets the money but does not have access to the funds.In an "anarchist" judicial system, two parties choose their "judge" (could be the same judge or two different ones). They present their evidence to that judge/s and the judge decides a verdict. If both judges come to different conclusions, they then move the case up to a random judge that imparts the final verdict. The same could be done with this system. Some members of the community can present themselves as impartial judges, they would gain credibility for their impartiality. They would be paid a cut of the amount being argued over.  This community could have used this system to get their road fixed and paid for it anonymously. As it is, the city may fine each contributor.http://www.kgw.com/video/featured-videos/SW-Portland-neighbors-repair-street-city-fuming-207540181.html?c=n&fb=y&can=n What you describe is similar to my BitPools concept in my signature. I hope to begin testing in about 2 weeks. Murderers. One. I would consider going to that one.But with the lack of exchanges in the UK those that live there have said that Bitcoin is not too prominant. Like I said, good luck with that.You are in good company with most Americans but they word things a bit differently.When the system collapses you will have an edge and be the best at scavenging while other people will starve. Your wealth of knowledge will come in handy. How exactly does a distributed escrow work? Is there someone that still decides which party was right and which was wrong? Happens all the time. Except it is called an online wallet. I have an illuminati in my bedroom and I had no idea it was planning on WW3.Should I unplug it or just turn off the switch? Words are fun.Good luck with that.  "Hey! The government can't control the sky. What if you lived in a balloon?" -Grampa Simpson 88F here...fortunately I work at night. In my air conditioned CHU during the day. Darn I was going to say a yard.I guess I do not get the "priviledge of donating to my pursuits" All of them?https://bitspend.net I too would like to see this study...perhaps one listing the most promiscuous countries and perhaps a list with phone numbers.  Bitcoin At its smallest it could be a few family members getting together to buy mom a birthday present. They find out how much they all are willing to spend first and then decide what to buy.At its largest it is a city of people trying to decide if they can fund a new electric company with people pledging their bitcoins and once certain thresholds are made, they can start getting proposals on what would be the best way forward. Once everyone agrees on one proposal the project is funded and the electric company is built.  So it is like Ripple is the Romney campaign with paid supporters while Bitcoin is the Ron Paul campaign with unpaid grassroots supporters.
It would be easier to get out of your war torn country and make it to a neutral country with bitcoins than it would take to get out with gold or money.And it would be easier for family to send money to their family members under attack.Imagine the jews in WWII having access to Bitcoin to bribe their way out or be able to pay for things while on the run. BitPools!Pooling bitcoins for large projects and voting with your money.Link in my sig to the discussion. Well, someone had to have seen the discussion at the conference. It was already shown that someone could put together a small 20 person coup to overthrow a government via Bitcoin.Reporter at Gizmodo went through the simulated steps of trying to put together such an operation with much success:http://gizmodo.com/5927379/the-secret-online-weapons-store-thatll-sell-anyone-anything  I can see Bitcoin being used for small bands of operatives coordinating anonymously online via encrypted messages, paying for military grade weapons via the anonymous Tor gun site and the group being able to amass an army better equipped than some small nations.So essentially, a small group of people could use Bitcoin to take over a nation.As far as its effects on a world war. Think the French resistance but being funded completely with Bitcoin. I predict Bitcoin reaches $1,000,000 by 2020. I recall paying 50 cents a gallon for gas back in the late 90s.$5,000 a bitcoin compared to $120 today is not that big of a stretch at the dollar's current pace.Bitcoin has a lot of room to grow. Hell, even of Bitcoin supporters only a handful use it for more than 75% of their spending. How many of your friends have bitcoins?Compare that to the amount of people you know who have used PayPal. http://bitcoincard.org/ If you cut my grass and I promise you a meal that weekend as a thank you for a good job, you have just accumulated wealth.It is mutual consent. If you cut 7 lawns and have a meal each day the next week you have accumulated wealth.If instead of the promise of a meal, I give you money that is the equivalent of a meal which you then hold onto until you are hungry, you have just accumulated wealth. It is the same thing. The voluntary exchange of goods and services.If you have accumulated knowledge and are the only person in the city that knows how to fix my car I choose between having no car or rewarding you properly for fixing it. I promise 1 meal a week for a month (or the equivalent monetary value).If I have a computer system that needs someone to fix the database and you have accumulated enough knowledge to the point where you can fix it, I decide whether or not to have a broken computer system or reward you properly for fixing it. I promise 1 meal a week for a year in exchange for a week of your time dedicated to fixing it. Or more simply, I pay you enough money to afford 1 meal a week for a year. That is accumulated wealth. All of these instances rely upon consent between the two individuals. If you do not want to do it, then you do not have to. If I do not want you to do the job, I do not have to ask you to do it. The education you gain at most colleges is not that different. Most of the books used are the same, sure your teacher may be one of the writers of the book and perhaps have a bit of a better understanding but you have just as much opportunity to learn at any college.The key to going to a college like Harvard or any ivy league school is that your roomate, the guy sitting next to you in class or the people you meet at various events are the children of senators, CEOs, bank presidents, etc.And when you are out on your own, starting a business...you start thinking about bringing in people you trust, people who you know what their talents are, people who have seen you passed out on top of a dead hooker at 4AM and have never breathed a word to anyone. Your college buddies. That is why you go to Harvard. That is why the current project I am working on which costs billions of dollars which was commissioned by a General was handed over to the VP of my company who just happened to be that General's college roomate. The current market cap for Bitcoin is around $1.3 billion. When you buy bitcoin, your dollars are not converted to bitcoin. You are trading your dollars value for value with someone else who has bitcoin. So even if everyone in the world bought one Satoshi at the current price, the money would just be switching hands.But, when the price rises, those mined bitcoins have just replaced more dollars than previously, displacing dollars thus having less demand for that equivalent amount.But the biggest thing that could hurt the federal reserve is if people not only switched to bitcoins for their every day purchases...but they also essentially send their federal reserve notes back to the federal reserve by paying off their debts. If the federal reserve is sitting there with a bunch of dollars with very little demand they will have to resort to practically giving it away in the hopes that people will use it. Interest rates would go negative, the spiral of dollar value to bitcoins would begin.Who's name is on the dollar? The Federal Reserve....Render therefore unto the Federal Reserve the things which are the Federal Reserve's. Send a public and private key while telling them they can spend it by making a wallet at blockchain.info.Then list a few sites for spending it.BitSpend for online purchases, Gyft for retail stores...  So MtGox could have been robbed by DHS before FinCEN released their regulations? How do I deal with it?I went from "screw you, you can't have it" (followed by threats)to...I'll work within the system with other like minded people to get the laws changed (come to find out, a majority of Americans are big supporters of taxes)to...time to work toward an alternative They went straight to Kokesh. Arrested him and one other guy. A few others were detained then let go after the rally. http://www.infowars.com/dc-armed-march-organizer-adam-kokesh-arrested-at-philly-pot-rally/?utm_source=Intel&utm_medium=twitterApparently he was standing near people who were smoking pot.An obvious attack because of his planned armed protest in DC planned for July 4th. I am thinking some place like North Korea that likely already blocks most Internet traffic (if they have Internet at all..) They can regulate it by banning any transactions over the Internet.Such a government would have full control over ISPs and force them to block bitcoin traffic or face fines or imprisonment.The way around this would be mesh networks, which would transmit Internet traffic wirelessly. These mesh nodes would also be illegal and anyone caught putting one up or broadcasting from their property would be considered criminals. The guy's whole theory is based on the idea that since this math guy is a loner who sprung his mathematical proof on the world, he is like Satoshi being a loner springing his Bitcoin concept on the world.I doubt that Satoshi would be Japanese too...and it was claimed that his writing was very british.
Tearing apart his background and character in order to discredit Bitcoin in 5....4....3....2... I saw no point in his request for topics to speak about at the Bitcoin conference where he was soliciting investments or should have publicly presented Blueseed's business plan. I would imagine that that would be something discussed after an investor contacts them and goes through the non-disclosure process and is vetted as a valid investor. Some of us requested being able to invest using bitcoins, which I would gladly invest a bit towards it.You keep talking about finalizing designs for a ship that has not yet been purchased. From their FAQ it appears that they are looking at buying a used cruise ship. You cannot finalize a design for a ship before you purchase it since any money spent toward that would be wasted if the ship designed for is not available by the time the money is ready. It would be like planning on building a building and having a few lots of land available. You could present the concept but final design could not be done until the lot is purchased and you know what the final lot's layout includes.It appears that they have narrowed down a criteria "between 190 and 230 meters (~620  750ft) long, and between 24 and 29 meters (~78  95ft) wide" and have received quotes on what it would take to retrofit that type of ship. Sweet, thank you for the step through...Was the reason you only paid $19.20 because the price had gone up a bit?When you pay for the $20 gift card then buy a pizza for less than $20 is there a way to get change back or do you just have that amount remaining on that card?Would test this out myself but am in Afghanistan. I agree, I am not investing in bitcoins. I am using my new currency.I do not invest in dollars either. "I support Bitcoin." -Elwar This whole idea that you will not spend your bitcoins because the value goes up boggles my mind.So what is the alternative?A. use an inflationary currencyB. not spendMost choose A. So your bank account sits there with money that is losing value. Why? Because you are willing to spend it. Is that the logic here?I still do not understand holding and spending government currency that loses value when you have the option of holding and spending bitcoins that gain value.Ever bought anything on the Internet? BitSpendEver gone shopping some place that takes gift cards? GyftEver had to pay a bill? BitcoinBillPay Most libertarians and an-caps agree that the initiation of force or fraud against someone is wrong and if there are any laws, they should focus on those two things.But I would say that Bitcoin has proven that people who are exposed to fraud are more aware and are more able to avoid it on their own.Just like the guy who is working on the BitcoinCard stated that he was considering taking pre-orders but because of the stigma that has within the community he decided not to do it. Everyone knows to be very careful with using bitcoins for PayPal. There are ways of dealing with scammers...exposing them and letting people see that person's history. E-bay ratings is a good example of how good businesses thrive while people who commit fraud can have their business affected. With today's technology fraud should stick to any person for the rest of their life...allow people to make their own decision on whether or not to deal with that person based on their past.Protecting us from fraud makes us complacent.Is it convenient to be protected? Sure. Being the first person to get screwed over by someone who was otherwise trustworthy would suck. But the threat of living with it the rest of their lives should discourage people from committing fraud in the first place. I have looked into delayed transactions. It is possible but the client has to still be running at the time of release. Thank you, I will be focussing on small organizations first so that the concept can take baby steps to explore this new type of organizing.Ultimately it needs to be open source, p2p but starting with a centralized platform to learn what works and what does not is a good approach I believe. They are the men behind their puppet, Alex Jones. Are walking around with a smoothie in your hand? You are looking at it wrong.You say you have some BTC, do you also hold dollars?If you hold dollars...why?Do not treat BTC as an investment. Treat it like your new currency. Think of it like moving to another country. You may still have some bills back in the states using dollars but the rest you should turn into the local currency. Start figuring out ways of spending your new money for things you used to spend with dollars.With BitSpend you can use bitcoins for anything on the Internet.With Gyft you can spend money in at most major retailers.With bitcoinbillpay you can pay most of your bills. You mean the ships passing by...Somalia?Should people not walk down sidewalks because walking down the sidewalk in the wrong neighborhood will get you shot? Hmm...2 is a lot. When getting a restraining order for a neighbor they are still allowed to pass within the allotted distance in order to live in their home. I looked into this for a neighbor that had to pass by my house every day to get home. He would have still been allowed to pass by the house. There are many expiriments working toward getting a hand to grow out of your shoulder. It appears the the first person had this successfully done.

When my bitcoins gain value I will pay taxes on them.As it is, I have lost all of my bitcoins that I bought at a low price. The only bitcoins I have left are the ones I bought at a high price. Those are the ones I spend.  If there were a decentralized computer system used to power your home or run your cell phone it would likely get more processor power than Bitcoin.We use money more than we use extra terrestrial knowledge or cancer research. That is the whole point of the voting system. Make the people think they have a voice and that they can change the system.We need to remember that during the American Revolution 80% of the people were ok with going along with the British system. The small percentage that were willing to grab their guns and fight were a small group compared to the main population. An ASIC in every home. As it states at the bottom of the page:* Electricity consumption is estimated based on power consumption of 650 Watts per gigahash and electricity price of 15 cent per kilowatt hour. In reality some miners will be more or less efficient. A good long read.http://reason.com/archives/2013/05/13/the-blank-slate-stateBasically the Honduran president's chief of staff is a libertarian with dreams of free cities. He was able to talk the president into giving it a trial run. After some comprimises getting the law passed through their congress it was set to go. But then it was fought at the Supreme Court level and overturned. It was overturned mainly for political reasons dealing with backlash against some corrupt politician.Now they are back at it drafting a new law that would fit within their Constitution and be able to face the scrutiny of the Supreme Court.More than likely, as things tend to go, the better the idea the more special interests will want to get involved to get their cut thus diluting it to the point where when it finally makes it through it is a bastardization of the original idea and will fail for those very reasons. http://blockchain.info/statsHash Rate and Electricity ConsumptionDifficulty11,187,257.46Hash Rate90,647.82 GH/sElectricity Consumption *1,414.11 megawatt hoursElectricity Cost$212,115.89Mining ProfitsOperating Profit$285,569.87 Operating Margin57.38%Profit Margin **32.38% I got a few millis.

Irwin Schiff was prosecuted in a court stacked against him that did not allow evidence."I will not allow the law in this courtroom" -- Judge Robert Dawson, Federal District CourtI bought his book about 15 years ago right out of college. I followed his steps for not paying taxes, I filed a zero return. The IRS sent me a letter, they did my taxes for me and asked for payment. I was just starting my career so I just cut them a check (being right out of college I only owed maybe a hundred bucks, more than likely I could have gotten money back).The fact that I do not have more guns than the US government means that they can do whatever the hell they want.

You will then fill that address with the amount you plan to use toward pledging toward projects. (It has to be empty first to verify that you did not just go out and grab someone else's address). From there you can either create a pool or join one.PoolsPools are basically groups of people getting together with a common goal. When a pool is created, the description of the purpose will be spelled out and a minimum pledge to join will be included. When you join the pool, a portion of your bitcoins from your bitcoin address will be dedicated to that pool. But you still hold your bitcoins in your wallet. When the pool grows large enough that they have enough bitcoins to put toward their common goal, then proposals will start being put forward.ProposalsProposals can be made by anyone (pool criteria may restrict proposals to only members). This is where it gets a bit more technical, click here to read about Dominant Assurance Contracts. Basically a proposal will be created, the proposer will fund a "Voter fund" with the proposal (or an address will be created and if there is interest, people can support the proposal by sending bitcoins to the "Voter fund"). The proposer will also include his/her own fee in the proposal along with the amount of bitcoins required to move forward with the proposal. Once the voter fund is sufficiently filled, a date will be set up and voting will commence.VotingWhen it is time to vote on a proposal, each pool member will receive a set of addresses with options (or a single address if it is a Yes/No proposal). A file with all addresses and their choice meaning will also be released, encrypted with a password. Before the end of the voting date members will then vote the amount of bitcoins required in the proposal by sending their bitcoins to the specified address. When the voting date has passed, the password to the encrypted file will be released. The BitPools site will automatically tally the votes and determine if the proposal passed or failed. If the proposal fails, everyone's bitcoins will be returned to their bitcoin address. If it succeeds it will be passed on to the address given by the proposer (this could be an escrow account or whatever the voters are comfortable with, that is part of the criteria for deciding to vote for a proposal or not). Regardless of the outcome, the "Voter fund" previously filled will be distributed to all voters. This creates an incentive for people to vote even those who would usually sit on the sidelines. At the very minimum the voter fund will cover transaction fees. If the proposal passess, a new pool will be created consisting of the members that voted for the proposal.New PoolsWhen the proposal succeeds, those that funded the proposal will be part of the new pool. The proposal will include the exact same criteria as when a new pool is created. The new pool could be exclusive only to those that funded the proposal, or a fee could be created for entry by new members. The fee can then be distributed in any way to the current members. Imagine a club getting together to fund a club house, the members have already paid for the club house...new members would pay those original members to be allowed access and join their club. Again, this is all criteria that would be included in the proposal. It also allows for many unique ways of distributing fees (equally, more to early members, tiered, etc.).Your funds are always under your control until you fund a proposal. It only resides in the BitPools cold storage during voting, then is immediately distrubuted once voting is finished.tl;dr Welcome to the revolution. I use HotSpot Shield.

Democracy is a very bad thing in a world full of idiots. bump for good info Yes, you would have full access to all of your funds in the qt app.If you send all of your funds back to the public address on your paper wallet you can continue to use it (just the same way you would send BTC to any other address). Or you could just use your bitcoinqt. When you spend that 3 out of 10 BTC from bitcoinqt, bitcoinqt will create a new address in your bitcoinqt wallet and the 7 BTC will be sent to that address. So now your bitcoinqt wallet will have 2 addresses, your original address and a new address with the 7 BTC (actually I think some of the BTC stays in your original address but I will not complicate things).What you can then do is go back into bitcoinqt and send 7 BTC to your original address. You can then delete your wallet file if you want once the transfer goes through. You now have 7 BTC on your original address.It would work the same as using your bitcoinqt. But the point of having a paper wallet is mainly to keep your private key off of your computer and the Internet to avoid someone stealing it. When you spend from any address...it sends all of the bitcoins from that address, not just the small amount you want to spend.It then returns your change to another address.Sorta like spending $6 but only having a 10 dollar bill. You cannot just spend $6 of that $10. You get 4 new dollars.I have run across this myself as I tend to keep most of my BTC in a single address. When I spend anything from that address it will return change to the wallet I am using in different addresses.What I tend to do is then send the contents of my wallet to that address. That way it re-combines all of my BTC to that single address.This is useful for long term storage of your bitcoins.Treat your cold storage as you would a savings account or a CD. Keep a small amount of spending money in an online wallet (I usually keep 1 BTC or so in MtGox to spend when I need to). <Sticky: One word per post!>Once upon a time, there was a Jesus.

Once the price of ASICs come down, it would be great to have people able to buy a TV box that they plug into their network and to the TV.You would have a menu of potential TV shows and movies. When you select the show you want to watch, it sends your accumulated bitcoins to the bittorrent user that loaded up the torrent.As people choose similar shows, the box can just queue up the next show that most people pick after the show you picked. So it would be like watching a full TV channel.And by sending BTC to the uploaders, people will be encouraged to create their own content in exchange for BTC.Sure, plenty of people would upload ripped movies and Hollywood TV shows, but Hollywood will become a thing of the past. New, decentralized content will be the wave of the future. You will likely be able to go into Best Buy in the next few years and buy an ASIC miner, cheap. Holding dollars supports a Federal Reserve that encourages wars and deficit spending.Holding bitcoins supports people with fast computers. It reads almost like criteria for a new software system presented to various agencies and before going ahead with the system they wanted to make sure they would not run into any legal problems moving forward and in exchange, a few new government positions would be created to be funded along with the new project.Everything CISPA wants to create can sorta be done now.  Private companies can spy on you. Google can collect information on you. Facebook can collect information on you. They can sell that information to the government. The government can even tell them specifically what kind of information they are looking for and those companies can focus on those specific sets of criteria.What the government cannot do, currently (sorta), is directly spy on you via those companies.It is one of those...government: "hey google, if you happen to be logging everyone's e-mail and if you were to happen upon someone talking about not paying their taxes...we would be willing to pay for that. but we're not telling you to go search for that information...*wink* *wink*" The fact that those same people keep getting elected has changed my mindset from thinking I should be helping Americans to be more free to realizing that they do not want to be free. It was not so much Obama winning as Ron Paul losing, twice...when people actually heard a voice of liberty and turned their back on it, or worse...openly attacked it.That the best approach is to foster those things which allow the few among us who actually crave freedom to have a vehicle to do so. Too rich for my blood...I am out.

I just want to move my government money to bitcoins in a way that gives me the most bitcoins possible. I do not have time to do this but it would be quite helpful.Basically a website you go to. You choose what bank you use (or manually enter the wire transfer fees, domestic/foreign, of your own bank), your country and choose the amount of money you want to spend on buying bitcoins.The site would then produce a table sorted by the most bitcoins you can get for that amount of money with some information on how long it will take for the transfer.It would need to factor in volume based upon the amount you want to spend (a site may have a low sell price of $110 but that is only 1 BTC and the next higher trade price is $120).You could put up a donation link, but you may actually get some real value by having a chart of people coming to your site letting you know how much they plan on spending on bitcoin in the near future. You can set up a trade bot to react accordingly. Baby steps. They must have seen how many people were wanting exchanges to be more decentralized so they went after MtGox to help us all move on to many other exchanges.Thanks DHS.

Meanwhile, under scrutiny from DHS, MTGox got DDOS'ed by CIA bots, Chinese pygmies licked thousands, drooling custard from Dwolla was MtGox's ace in the hole. Other exchanges actually offer more than MtGox. I usually exchange to BTC on MtGox before moving it to either BitFinex or btc-e.MtGox is about to lose a significant amount of its market share. I guess I have been using the bank->Dwolla->MtGox->bitcoin for the simplicity of it and I figured it was cheapest since Dwolla only charges 25 cents and MtGox only charges .55%But in reality, MtGox almost always has the highest price of all exchanges.So doing bank->wire transfer->1% at some other exchange may allow me to buy my bitcoins cheaper at another exchange if the price is lower. Plus I will not need to wait almost a week for my transfer to go through Dwolla as the price rises. Good luck with your new alt coin. Like clockwork. This time last week I would have my paycheck rolling into my account to be traded for BTC.Rooting for a week long crash has become exhausting. But, alas, it always climbs back up just in time for me to exchange my money. <Sticky: One word per post!>Once upon a time, there was a Jesus. She walked out unadorned.

I do not really care much about getting dollars from MtGox. But I mainly use MtGox to transfer my government currency to bitcoins. They have been the cheapest, 25 cents for Dwolla plus .5% at MtGox.Has CoinBase gotten their act together to allow for larger purchases?

Meanwhile, trolls eating 2 µBTC  Does that mean I did not win? I sold all of my BTC and bought all Amazon coins. I am in this for the long haul!Gonna be rich! An overhyped conference that does not produce what is hyped up results in a lower price.This conference does not seem to be overhyped (or hyped much at all).If some new technologies are announced it should give a slight bump to bitcoin. Especially in regards to a way to pay in brick and mortar stores with some sort of bitcoin card.BitPay will be announcing the numbers for Gyft usage after their initial week. This should be newsworthy. People tend to want to get rid of their bad money and keep their good money.Merchants would not want to get rid of their good money, they want to get rid of their bad money (change). What solved problems do not benefit society? I just hacked your account dude.I am keeping your password the same so you can log in as the same person to acknowledge my hacking skillz.If you want me to unhack your account send a donation to the address in my signature.
You could just pay people for their computing time in BTC. Or rather than computing time, pay for results. Is there no end to this man's genius? Because people think that taxes are a no brainer. That it harms nobody. If you are making $100 million and you take away $40 million, nobody is harmed. So why try to come up with alternatives when the current scenario nobody is affected? That is the mentality.Go onto a liberal website, such as huffingtonpost, and suggest a world without taxes. It is not a concept that is even imaginable. Pretty ironic since these people like to think of themselves as "enlightened". They only see the side of what the government gives you. The concept of government taking is like a blind spot that they cannot fathom, it has been done that way for almost a century so there is no other option.There are too many arguments about what the government should provide. That is what most political arguments involve. I could care less about that. They can give out lolipops to everyone as far as I care. That is like discussing the most moral way to dispose of a body after you have killed someone, without even considering whether or not the act of killing was bad or not. Died in 2010 This. I have been to several conferences, several with comedians. There is usually at least some entertainment. There was once a guy who ran for president. His track record was consistent and principled. His stance on every issue revolved around following the Constitution. He felt that the Federal Reserve had too much control over our economy. He had a plan to balance the budget in 2 years. His words were backed up by his actions for over 30 years in office.That is one story. The other story?There was a quixotic racist who was nuts who was trying to run for president but was way too old and wore shoes that are unstylish. He was known to hang out with members of the KKK and had the support of the owner of a whore house. He basically hates America and blames Americans for 9/11.People with big ideas are people. People can be attacked easily.Satoshi left us with an idea.I love reading articles by people who are itching to attack Satoshi because they cannot attack the idea. The best they can do is call him an unknown hacker. Or level mistrust in something "we don't even know who created it". They wish they knew. I have thought about this as well. We are relying too heavily on the fact that bandwidth is essentially free for most people with a monthly data plan.But I do not see this as a permanent solution.I do think the best way forward for the Internet is to have a sort of pay to play type of setup where you pay for your bandwidth usage from remote site to your computer. I believe bitcoin is the answer for how to pay for this, but am not sure of the best method yet.In such a scenario, each node in the network would get paid based upon the amount of traffic that passes through their node. So people would want all of the Bitcoin traffic to pass through their nodes so they can get paid for it. Also, locations where a lot of traffic is generated will have a lot of people around it helping to pass the traffic. Since I will soon be opening up my software (BitPools) for initial testing I will chime in on this.Crowdfunding in the current sense is ok, but it can be improved by using bitcoin.With current crowd funding a problem is usually presented with the solution up front and the work is done toward funding that solution.With the BitPools approach, people will pledge funds toward a problem. When a solution is agreed upon by enough people it is then funded.The use of Dominant Assurance Contracts will encourage people to work together toward solving a problem where even if everyone is not in 100% agreement on the solution, they are still satisfied with voluntarily contributing.Bitcoin makes things a lot easier because of its transparency which allows people to pledge support for a project with the ability to prove that they hold enough bitcoins to support the pledge while never needing to actually part with their money until it is to go into use. Using BitPay the merchant chooses the percentage of the daily total to be paid in dollars or bitcoins. Sure, I will play. I wonder how this would go as a bitcoin gambling game. So if there is no real punishment, if there is a way for things to be paid for, then I should be able to not pay taxes right?If it is no big deal for me to pay taxes, then it should be no big deal for me to not pay taxes. Food has become less and less a main budgetary concern for most people as opposed to years past. Your whole day sort of centered around getting, preparing, eating your meals. If you look at needing to take the wheat and grind it then bake it in the wood stove, etc.Now food eaten is less a necessity as an experience. We want variety, taste, health, atmosphere, etc.If I could have whatever food I desired based upon the increase in bitcoin's value I would still continue working to accumulate bitcoin because I have goals and ambitions beyond just sitting around eating. I played this once in high school where they were trying to teach us some sort of lesson.Instead of the kill/trade they just had us do rock paper scissors with our hands but just one finger or two to show our choice.I understood where the teacher was going with this and understood that by choosing the one finger (trade in this case) each time that if my partner did the same then we would both end up with the highest combined total. My partner did not quite get it through and put out a two finger every once in a while getting more points. But there were a couple of other people who had higher scores than her. Her being hot may have played a role as well.

Through dollar cost averaging  the more often you invest equal amounts the closer you will be over time to the average rate of increase.That 1% you get back at the end of the year on your credit card is denominated in a currency that has over 10% yearly loss  in value. Would there be a way to set up an android emulator on my PC and send a gift card to my mother for mother's day on her iPhone?I am in Afghanistan so no phone (well, I have a cheap Nokia for emergencies). make your time So, you would rather have taxes instead of free money because Republicans are bad.Makes sense. It was already mentioned that it will not be static. Moving at a constant rate of "<5kn in a figure-8 pattern". This guy is based out of Houston, is he the one that took part of Ron Paul's district seat? So, instead of hoarding...the best way to make money in this system is to have as little money possible. Then when the distribution takes place, sell all but the smallest amount.Sounds good to me. I will take .00000001 of these coins please.
According to the map on that page, Satoshi lives in middle of the ocean off the coast of Africa.Satoshi either lives under the sea or is a seasteader. There is no end to his advanced thinking. This is great, I look forward to paying my bills with this service.Is there a reason that only rent is allowed as opposed to a mortgage? So you're telling me there's a chance... I have considered writing a program to be able to track who is who on the Internet based upon their writing style (note, I have come close to working on a government project where I could have done just that...your identity is not safe on the Internet).Most people have a very limited vocabulary depending upon intelligence. I believe the number I saw was around 150,000 words on average. Not everyone will use the same 150,000 words so if two people do a lot of writing on the Internet, they will likely write a good chunk of their own word base or a main subset. If two different people's word set do not correlate, then they are likely different. But, if you have one person's total writing and then you compare it against the words of many people you can get a percentage of word usage.More importantly, most people will have similar sentence structure or use combinations of words in a more telling way than their bucket of words. So I would have taken combinations of words added together and given them more credit toward the possibility that two people are the same.There was a study done taking a similar approach to news articles and comparing those articles to wording used by congressmen to show which congressmen were using the language of which news articles. They then gave a percentage to the various news agencies of whether they leaned more democrat or republican. Most sites correlated just about how you would think, CNN, MSNBC, etc favoring democrats while FoxNews favored republicans. Surprisingly Drudge Report came out as the most balanced but that is just because they link to several different sources of news.Personally, I actually change my writing style on the Internet for this very reason. Do those broadcasts mention that most of those massacres take place in places where having a gun is illegal? Global Network of Hackers Steals dollars worth over 385,000 BTC From ATMshttp://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/global-network-hackers-steal-45m-atms-19148657Is the dollar safe? Should I sell all of my dollars until this security flaw is fixed? http://www.businessinsider.com/rich-getting-richer-2013-4#ixzz2SvozejTHAt current bitcoin prices, if you have more than 7,000 BTC you are on the safe side of the economy. Your wealth will grow while others will fall. If you can get on this boat you should be able to ride the wave of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. The folks in Washington will actually be working for you.It also shows that the wealthy are saving (hoarding) while everyone else is doing all of the heavy lifting and spending all of their money. A good lesson on how to get (and stay) rich.Personally, I would shoot for just over 800 BTC since eventually in the next few years it will be over $1000/BTC.  Hmm, so the consensus seems to be that since people cannot fathom a world without taxes, even with the guarantee that things will be paid without taxes is inconceivable.The basic question is, if things can be paid for without taxes...would you be ok with it?That is always the response when I mention not paying taxes "what about the roads and firemen and health care?". It would seem that people want taxes so things could be paid for...but I suspect that most people like taxes more as a punishment for being rich or making too much money.I believe that the incentive to punish those with more is larger than the incentive to have things paid for. People are too focussed on this being revolutionary in the US.But think about someone in Rwanda getting hold of a cheap 3D printer, perhaps a whole village pooling their money to get one and spitting out a gun for every man woman and child in a village. The next time a warlord rolls in with his truck full of armed men to rape and pillage, they may be met by a village of armed citizens.There is plenty of tyranny out there suprisingly worse than the US. This will have an impact there before anything happens in the US. .000001 is a microBitcoin or a "Mickey".We should name the new low, 5340 Satoshies as a "Gavin". He can still provide the data to US citizens. Let us say, for example, that some ultra super rich guy has spent his whole life accumulating half of the gold of the world secretly. He has died and put in his will that he wants the money from his gold to go toward paying for the US government spending. We are talking trillions upon trillions. The only stipulation is that no taxes may be collected while spending his money.The budget will be met for the next 30 years, there is always the option of falling back to taxing if the money runs out.Would you be ok with nobody paying taxes for those 30 years? Even rich people and corporations. If someone does not voluntarily pay, what should happen to them? Incubator babies is the solution.Similar to these you can buy at the store:http://www.genpets.com Wow...this actually is a pretty big deal. Being able to pay with bitcoins at major retailers.Of the trifecta:Able to buy anything online: Check (bitspend)Able to buy anything at stores: Partial (Gyft)Able to pay bills with bitcoin: Not yet (bitcoinbillpay currently working on it)Not too shabby. Every time you borrow BTC at a high interest rate an angel gets their wings. I am not sure of the exact formula to come up with these numbers but it has been Bullish ever since I have been checking it before the big crash.My assumption is that the formula has something to do with the amount of longs vs the amount of shorts on the website. So currently there are a lot of people with shorts out on margin.From my observation, it is usually the most bearish closest to the low. This is the most bearish I have seen. Perhaps Bitcoin can be used for black market medicine.Like doctors treating patients for money. If you think that seasteading is about getting the most bang for your buck when it comes to square footage of property, you are way off. As long as I can use bitcoin for what I need to use and leave government currency behind that is all I care about. If other people use it or not, that is up to them.I can already use bitcoin for about 80% of what I spend on.
Kinda like how the dotcom boom made geeks all the most powerful people?Nerds & Geeks seem to be ok with being ruled at the point of a gun. People who are not very smart but are charismatic are the ones in control of those guns. A submarine coming into US waters shooting a torpedo at a ship flying a US flag?I think someone would have something to say about that.Edit: It appears that they will be using a more freedom friendly nation for their flag. But they are still within the US's EEZ. This is a great first step toward full seasteading. Related to bitcoin, have you been getting any funding in bitcoin? Bought $10k worth at $14.Then it crashed to $2 and I got Zhoutonged trying to get my money back. Maybe we can designate 5340 Satoshies as a Gavin. I saw Warren Buffet turn into a reptile before my very eyes.He then ate a small child then got back into his human suit and ate an ice cream for desert.Ice cream is the key to it all. Someone needs to encode the CAD file into the blockchain. Would it be better for Bitcoin if the alt coin world were saturated with thousands of alt coins or would it hurt it?Does that solidify Bitcoin more as the main coin or does it dillute it?It would seem to me that having one or two competing coins would create some competition, but with thousands, alt coins would become something nobody would want to invest in. I have used them. I bought some dog food for my dogs and a book for my nephew. It is actually quite convenient, I do not even need to register and setup my checkout at the online store I am buying from either. They are like my personal shoppers.I am not sure about plane tickets, I was wondering about that myself. Maybe if you went through all of the steps then gave them the website and the exact choices necessary they may be able to do it. I was considering doing this for a cruise. You can always try, all they will do is send an e-mail saying that they cannot purchase it for you. The top angle pieces grow when they move. I think the same trick could be used. Why don't you think so? Not a coincidence. Yes, FINCen making it so that anyone trading bitcoins for dollars was oh so helpful.Took down at least one exchange, stopped bitcoinbillpay, made it so a decentralized exchange will only work if it goes through the government (centralized) approved exchanges.Good thing? Any new regulation is never good. No matter the intentions. I wonder if 1000 new alt coins per day would hurt Bitcoin or solidify it as the main coin.Maybe I should create it... Tired of waiting for a new alt coin of the day to come out? Want to create your own?Introducing the alt coin generator.You simply go to www.altcoingenerator.co and choose from the drop down menus and it will spit out the source code and a precompiled binary for your new alt coin.Some of the alt coin options:NameScript, no scriptnumber of coins totalnumber of coins per blocktime between blocksnumber of pre-mine blocks to createiconHave a great idea for an alt coin? Use this app and become rich as everyone drops Bitcoin and starts using your coin.First 1000 alt coins are free. Limit 10 alt coins per user after that.Watch this quick how-to to get started:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0Edit: site is currently under construction as I turn this into a p2p distrubuted alt coin itself. Mining will spit out alt chains in blocks of 50 per 2 minutes. Maximum will be 2.1 billion. The BTC price is falling because everyone is dumping their BTC for yacoin.  I just paid someone 10 BTC for 10000 YAC.They are holding the YAC in escrow for me. Was this a good deal? Millies have been agreed upon for millibitcoins and Mickeys for microbitcoins. I took a class on group psychology once, here is the reason for petitions.A petition is usually worded in such a way that you will likely side with the person doing the petition. You will put your name down further verifying that you are on the side of the petitioner.If, down the road, the subject comes up...then you know what side you are on and you have gone the extra step of putting your name to it so you will be more willing to defend it. And even donate to it or volunteer.
That is because a large chunk of Bitcoin's price is people just wanting to invest in something and get a good chunk of change out of it. Not for converting over to their new currency.Alt coins offer a higher risk with higher returns and thus attract some of those investors.I am converting most of my dollars to bitcoins for future use but I have taken a small bit for investment into LTC with the knowledge that they will soon be trading on MtGox and those same MtGox day traders will be willing to jump onto that market just as quickly.When you do not actually care about the underlying product you are trading, alt coins are just as good as anything else. I have mined 1000 coins. I will sell half for 10 BlooCoins/1YAC. 10 print "YAC created."20 goto 10 Hi, I saw a thread with a bunch of posts.What is going on in here? I tried to mine it early, even translated the Chinese announcement before it was on here and did not get a single CNC.I mined for about 2 days then gave up.Would the reason be that I am running it on my (fairly new) laptop, or that my Internet connection sucks? I propose an alt coin based upon this: +1all scams I could really care less about Litecoin. I just know the price will go up when it hits Gox so it is currently a good investment.Killing microtransactions hinders a good chunk of my business model that would definitely add inherent value to Bitcoin. No longer will we be able to send someone a satoshi.I am no longer a satoshi millionaire.RIP satoshi. I am buying mainly Litecoin for now until they are put on MtGox...I will sell when they are 10x more valueable than what I paid for them. I doubt it will take long with all of the trade going on MtGox, even if a tiny portion decides to dabble.The longer it takes for MtGox to start trading it, the more I can buy. I have succesfully used it to buy 1 BTC just to test it.I helped a buddy at work buy 1 BTC as well. Buying large amounts seems to be the difficulty. I used MtGox for that. A mining pool to allow microtransactions to pass through. As I suggested on the Seasteading forum, I believe one of the best business models would be that of a weapons research facility and manufacturer.Anyone attacking the site would become test subjects for new products. I hope so...I can see a few people posting about transaction problems.Though people who do not visit this site will have no clue about it so we may not even know if someone is having trouble. We need a mining pool that does not upgrade to 0.8.2.I would be willing to buy an ASIC and join that pool specifically for this. At the top of the forum it shows: All users of Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind versions 0.7.2 and earlier are required to upgrade to 0.8.1 or apply a manual workaround by May 15.What do you think will happen on May 15? 0.8.2 will have the small transaction change with some bug fixes...We can upgrade to 0.8.3 that has the transaction change taken out and leaves in the bug fixes. I have a working model of this ready to be released in the next few weeks. Barring microtransactions will make this akin to a poll tax. This is a big hit on my business model.Volatility of price is one thing...volatility of functionality is another. http://www.informationweek.com/internet/ebusiness/china-limits-use-of-virtual-currency/218101859I wonder why they failed to mention that in the documentary.
Sounds like the idea of contract insurance.Where every transaction and contract which wants assurance that it will be executed correctly can pay into the contract insurance.If the contract is not fulfilled, private police and courts can execute the enforcement of the contract.I suppose the larger the contracts the larger the police and court system, thus a private "military". If you go you may miss a big buying or selling opportunity.Leaving the house is dangerous. This is good. I have been using the easy deposit at MtGox to move my BTC over to other exchanges. The closer they are in price the better. I have considered this, but you have to figure in the retail side of things. Getting people to buy your stuff is not all that easy. For my wife's shop we would usually pay on average about 30% of the retail price. But from there you need to factor in getting people to actually buy your product. Advertising costs money, if you have a product and you are selling online (she was mainly a local store which had its own overhead to factor in) you need to either have the product shipped to you and stored so that you can then pack it up yourself and ship it or you can do drop shipping where the wholesaler ships for you, but then you have to deal with more competition of other drop shippers and the fact that you cannot inspect the quality of the item before it gets to your customer which could tarnish your reputation. And then you have people who take up your time asking all sorts of customer service types of questions about the quality of the item, the speed of delivery, money back guarantees, etc. And if there is anything wrong with the product you need to refund and have it shipped back to the wholesaler or have your name tarnished.Meanwhile, you have your product sitting there advertised for sale while the price of bitcoin goes up when you could have just converted your money in the first place.I am not saying selling things for Bitcoin is a bad idea as opposed to simply exchanging, just that there is a lot that goes into it. The next step is trying to figure out what value you can create by starting a bitcoin business.  Looks real to me. Is it ready for launch yet? Did the 10 BTC cover the whole cost of the shuttle or do you need the 30 BTC for the rest and donations for the arm and lasers? I have a bunch of cards I want to trade. Is there some sort of Magic The Gathering Online eXchange? I watched it too and they were just talking gibberish. This is bad news for Bitcoin. I was even able to show my 75 year old mother how to use CoinBase.Do you have a bank account? Yes, it is definitely different from the $2 low in 2011 where people were not sure if Bitcoin would even survive.Now it is about the price going down so you can get your hands on some bitcoins. Not all that bearish. Aliens I still could not find the donation link for helping to colonize space. Could you provide a link?Your other link is just to some Alex Jones conspiracy theorist type. Is there not a method of choosing new leaders to the board within the foundation membership?If that is not specified, then joining a foundation that has that capability would probably be a good move. Geography does not necessarily hinder this approach, look at how Iceland worked for over 300 years.http://praxeology.net/libertariannation/a/f13l1.htmlIn outline, the system's main features were these: Legislative power was vested in the General Assembly (althingi); the legislators were Chieftains (godhar; singular, godhi) representing their Assemblymen (thingmenn; singular, thingmadhr). Every Icelander was attached to a Chieftain, either directly, by being an Assemblyman, or indirectly, by belonging to a household headed by an Assemblyman. A Chieftaincy (godhordh) was private property, which could be bought and sold. Representation was determined by choice rather than by place of residence; an Assemblyman could transfer his allegiance (and attendant fees) at will from one Chieftain to another without moving to a new district. Hence competition among Chieftains served to keep them in line. The General Assembly passed laws, but had no executive authority; law enforcement was up to the individual, with the help of his friends, family, and Chieftain. Disputes were resolved either through private arbitration or through the court system administered by the General Assembly. Wrongdoers were required to pay financial restitution to their victims; those who refused were denied all legal protection in the future (and thus, e.g., could be killed with impunity). The claim to such compensation was itself a marketable commodity; a person too weak to enforce his claim could sell it to someone more powerful. This served to prevent the powerful from preying on the weak. Foreigners were scandalized by this "land without a king"; but Iceland's system appears to have kept the peace at least as well as those of its monarchical neighbors. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Commonwealthhistorian Birgir Solvason states that Icelandic society was "more peaceful and cooperative than its contemporaries"; in England and Norway, by contrast, "the period from about 800 to 1200 is a period of continuous struggle; high in both violence and killings."  The US government is making sure decentralization is very difficult. Mainly the part about anyone exchanging currencies requiring huge license fees and other hoops to jump through. But he lives in the US...you would think he would have gotten the messaged that the SPLC is a hate group that collects money so that they can publish lists of people they hate. That is some scary shit.The insane person who wrote that article actually quoted The Southern Poverty Law Center as being a reputable group. It has been discussed here.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=191039.0Fortunately right now there is only a link to the porn on Tor. But it is certainly possible to put a series of numbers into the block chain such that when put together can be read by an image viewer.The thing is, it cannot be taken out of the chain without compromising the whole chain.The only way to address this would be for miners to filter every transaction for a potentially harmful series of numbers and catch it before it goes onto the chain. But that is just about impossible and harmful to Bitcoin itself.Like I said, I love Bitcoin but the first time someone is prosecuted for having kiddie porn on their computer because of the blockchain, then Bitcoin will suffer horribly. This would be the answer that governments could use to cripple Bitcoin. At the very least, the economic stuff can be easily taken care of this way. Especially with the help of Bitcoin. As solid as Bitcoin is, I believe this would be the easiest way to attack it. To knowingly possess child porn is a crime. As decentralized as Bitcoin is, only offshore sites holding the blockchain would make it vulnerable.
Down below $100....here it goes...Kiddie porn in the block chain, DDOS on Silk Road, CoinLab suing MtGox...This will be a long fall. I do not care what you call it. As long as I can use it to buy things then that is all I need. Or I just go to wikipedia and find the exceptions.If the information is incorrect maybe you should edit the page so we can all benefit. Tirades about how forcing people to do things against their will is good for society in 5...4...3...2... http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/02/technology/security/bitcoin-porn/?source=cnn_bin"The U.S. Justice Department wouldn't comment on this specific case, but an agency spokesman pointed CNNMoney to the exact wording of the law, which states that the issue becomes a crime when a person "knowingly possesses, or knowingly accesses with intent to view" child porn. It doesn't appear that an unsuspecting user with these coded links sitting on their hard drive has much to worry about. "Downloading the blockchain to look at some porn? No? Then no crime. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_tax_in_the_United_States"Non-taxable gifts"Took less than a minute to find what gifts are not taxable. Why would I need an accountant. I am the one giving away my bitcoins as gifts. Looks like it will be next Thursday. I still call feathers in hats 'macaroni'. Bitcoin will be worth over $10,000 by the end of 2016. Bitcoins that are lost still exist. The fact that more bitcoins are created means their amount of bitcoins is inflating for over 100 years. Bitcoin will be inflationary for the next 100+ years. http://www.10news.com/news/worlds-first-bitcoin-atm-coming-to-san-diego-050213Users will be able to make deposits and/or withdrawals from their Bitcoin wallets by walking up to a Bitcoin ATM and using a QR code or by entering your personalized Bitcoin wallet address -- then go shopping online. The world's first Bitcoin ATM will be unveiled in San Diego Thursday, and the Company will show 10News how it works and the idea behind Bitcoin.  I guess Mother's Day is in a few weeks.Post some good ideas of what to get mom this year using bitcoins. I e-mailed that link to her. She said she was going to use it but found this: Gifts that are exempt from income taxes:Gifts that are not more than the annual exclusion for the calendar year ($14,000 per recipient for 2013)Gifts to a political organization for its useGifts to charitiesGifts to one's (US Citizen) spouseTo anyone I give bitcoins to...that is my gift to you. We would need a logo like this: I e-mailed her some ways of getting by on just spending bitcoins. With bitspend and the ability to buy so many things online in San Francisco it should not be too difficult.The spin of the story so far is "oh my gosh it's such torture having to limit myself to only using Bitcoin...not yet ready for public use".The headline could also read "Someone with very little knowledge of Bitcoin tries to do things most experienced Bitcoin users do not do, with no preparation."The wired magazine guy who did a story on how to disappear at least was given some lead time to prepare. The Forbes reporter could have ordered a starbucks card and a bus pass and used bitspend to top them up as needed throughout the week. Could have ordered an OKPay card. Could have ordered a pre-paid phone with cards that could be topped up.She could do a month easy by taking a week to get things prepared. In 2011 Silk Road was about 80-90% of Bitcoin transactions. Today it is closer to 20-30%.Illegal transactions are actually a good thing, it shows that the system works.When the government is going home to home confiscating weapons and bibles you will want a currency that can buy things the government does not like. That is why I never go to Bitcoin meetups. A small group of people getting together is centralization.I am such a big Bitcoin supporter that I check the localbitcoins map and try to find the location furthest from everyone else to help with Bitcoin decentralization.
Those same people are pessimistic about all new technology and will be in the same boat for everything in their lives.The thing is, most of the early adopters did not just buy a few thousand bitcoins and then just sit back and wait. Most of them played an active role in getting Bitcoin to where it is today.Those people complaining could easily put in the same effort into something else with the same amount of people putting in the effort and reaping the rewards.If the same people that created Bitcoin had put the same effort into curing cancer and benefitted from the sale of the cure those same people would be complaining about those greedy cancer curers. I am working on HeliumCoin. It has 4 times as many coins as FeatherCoin. So it is even lighter. He is openly laughing at us.Sickening. Maybe because the Chinese people would actually give a damn. I believe they reduced the default fee in the latest client release. But it would be up to miners to accept/reject/delay blocks with too low of fees. Bitcoin is already illegal in China.And what is the big deal about Tiananmen?http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dWvCCxOUsM8 Good, then you should have seen the answers to all of your questions there as they are the basic ones most people ask about first.Though, that would likely be better discussed in a thread that was not about an island on land. Your responses sound like you think that nobody has thought of everything you are talking about already. It would be like someone hearing about Bitcoin and saying "What about double spends? You need to think about people's private keys getting stolen. Nobody accepts them so they're useless. It's a ponzi scheme.".The seasteading concept has been around for almost a decade. They have forums just like this where people have addressed these questions. They have Peter Thiel donating several million dollars towards research, they have patented one of their initial concepts, they are moving from the research phase to the testing phase by using a cruise ship to test business models. They are taking baby steps, most likely starting by working with a government under their flag within their EEZ and in more hospitable waters.Pirates, social structure, materials that can last in salt water, structures that can handle 100+ foot waves (rogue waves), EEZ, different temperatures, weather patterns currents throughout the world. Several prototypes of different concepts including submersibles and concrete submarines have been attempted. Seasteading is not a new concept. http://www.seasteading.org if you want answers to your questions. Their FAQ addresses almost every question you posed: http://www.seasteading.org/about/faq/ How low do oil rigs submerge during storms?http://seasteading.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Engineering-Development-Plan_GLP_2012-08-08-alt-3.pdfAt the bottom is the 2012 to 2017 plan which explores energy sources, structures, breakwater structures, modularity/scalability, materials, mooring systems, dynamic positioning systems, and station keeping.There are several business plans out there including an offshore medical treatment center which would garner about $29 million per year on a ~$100 million investment. They are also looking at fish farm/aquaculture, algae production and processing, offshore tech center, offshore data haven.Social engineering they have begun interviewing potential seasteaders to get a good idea of the requirements (I personally spoke to one of their reps for about 45 minutes over the phone). When everyone uses Bitcoin as their currency, we all win.Oh wait...banks lose.And big corporations.And governments. Hey my prediction of \__/  from August 2011 to August 2012 was fairly accurate. Even saying it would start to pick up after the change from 50 per block to 25 which was the end of November.I have no idea where it will be a year from now. My prediction was that it would be over $100 by the end of the year. I did not expect it to happen this fast. Satoshi sent me this:Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving astrusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough formost transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannotavoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting theminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversibleservices. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants mustbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertaintiescan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make paymentsover a communications channel without a trusted party.What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trustedthird party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellersfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. Inthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributedtimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. Thesystem is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than anycooperating group of attacker nodes.He sent this as his key:http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf I believe that there are a few reasons for that. For one, most Bitcoin users are a bit more forgiving of innovative and yet raw websites coming out. They can look past the lack of ergonomics and joe six pack simplicity and are willing to jump through some hoops to use your service (look at how people exchange government currency for bitcoins).Secondly, Bitcoin is sort of highlighting the fact that patents and copyrights are not exactly necessary as most new services within Bitcoin have become the de-facto company for that service. Look at MtGox and the amount of problems they are having. But because they were first and are trusted, they get the traffic. BitPay actually has competitors. There are other services that do what BitPay does, but because they were first, they are considered the main company for merchants accepting bitcoins. Look at SatoshiDice. I have not been there since they first opened, but it was just a web page with tables of numbers.Getting out the door first yields you rewards. See this thread about illegal content on the blockchain:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=11381.0Also, I have added the following porn to the blockchain:80085 People who want Bitcoin to be anonymous can make it anonymous for themselves.Same as with using cash for things you do not want people to know about instead of traceable purchases. This was a project created at the hackathon.Prototype stage at this point. Some interesting predictions. Ya, the last time I did a thread about how stable it was things went nuts. That was over a year ago though.You all may want to borrow on margin just in case. As long as it jumps from $120 to $160 and back again over and over...that would be exciting...And people would start taking out some more margin loans. Crash or rocket to the moon already!Entertain me speculators!Blitz: shortened title
I believe it is implied that the employer would pay bitcoins based upon the current rate of exchange to government currency. I was being facetious, see the large study on waves done by the Seasteading Institute below that.My design was using ferrocement spheres built at a low enough cost that you could have thousands of them interconnected which could distribute the impact of the waves. As enough are built it becomes a sort of floating island that can keep expanding. Similar to the guy who made an island out of plastic bottles but more long term and at a higher volume. It would certainly save the hassle of converting my paychecks every two weeks (along with the wait for transfer to dwolla). I do not really watch the ticker all day, I check on it when I come into work and have a page open that shows a price but up or down is no big deal to me. It was a wild ride in the $2-$8 (imagine swings from $100 to $400 and back) range during the Bitcoinica manipulator days.Now I am just focussed upon getting a Bitcoin business going and moving from a life where I used government currency to bitcoins. I have considered this as well. Think of it as a club where rich guys all gather in a smoke filled back room.You all agree to do something, you all do it then show proof that you did it.Those that do not do it are no longer get to join those rich guys in the smoke filled back room to find out when the next move is.And the key to being part of it is to make money. As long as there is long term incentive to keep making that money then there is less incentive to try to screw over the group. I make some decent money by loaning out bitcoins.More of this theory stuff of people assuming things that in reality actually happen. No, the folks working on seasteads have no concept of waves. They just plan on putting house boats out in middle of the ocean and having a big party.http://seasteading.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Feb2011_Report_p1.pdf Ideally...a decentralized exchange would work like this:You open the application. You have a list of bid/ask prices. Each bid/ask also has a means of payment and a user rating.You have money in ING so you narrow the bid/asks down to using ING p2p payment. You see several options then you narrow it down again by rating (you only want 100% trusted with more than 100 trades). You see the best price for those criteria and you execute your buy. You send the money and get the bitcoin and rate the transaction.Also, ideally, the software will include an easy API for every type of payment method for sellers. So you can hook your bank account up to the software and have it automatically send bitcoin once the correct amount has been transferred to your bank account. Even an API (all open source of course) to allow you to send money from your account in exchange for bitcoins.If people want more access, they will set up more means of funding accounts which will give them better prices.That is ideal. But the government destroys ideal. I get paid to sit at a computer and monitor log files on the chance  that something breaks. Like an overpaid security guard. I believe Canada was working on something like this.This actually benefits Bitcoin because it would make conversion between the two currencies much easier, allowing people to move out of their inflationary government currencies and into Bitcoin. You are making a lot of assumptions that are simply not true (very common assumptions though).I use bittronic.net as my hosting service. I pay in bitcoins monthly.You can buy just about anything on the Internet at bitspend.netI spend my bitcoins all the time, I do not regret spending it any more than I would regret the amount of money I have spent on things throughout the year in dollars.The key to a deflationary currency is that if you have the choice between having and spendng a deflationary currency or having and spending an inflationary currency, why would you choose to use inflationary currency?Assume bitcoin gains 1% in value per day compared to the dollar (a conservative estimate). I owe $66 per month for my dedicated hosting service on the 1st. Dollars:I get paid on the 15th, I decide to pay my hosting service early (since the value of my dollar goes down anyway, no need to wait). I pay $66 for the next month's service.Bitcoins:I get paid on the 15th, I convert those dollars to bitcoins. I wait until the 1st. I pay the equivalent bitcoin amount for $66.For dollars, there is little change.For Bitcoins, I have to wait 3 days to move my bitcoins to MtGox where I convert my dollars to bitcoins. Total cost: .5%. It sits in my wallet for 12 days. 12 days at 1% equals 12% gain in value minus the .5%. This gives me an 11.5% discount or $7.59.My biggest regret with bitcoin is when I see my bank account and I have any dollars in there losing value. You failed to mention that all of your economics teachers likely have memorized Keynes' books and worship his every word. Which is ironic because Keynes is no longer stating theories because he is dead, and thus there is no more supply of his theories and thus no inflation of further theories. So Keynes should be ignored by anyone who supports inflation.Come back when you understand Hayek, Mises and Friedman. Reddit is more hardcore bullish than here. I am working on an alt currency that will have 4 times as many coins as FeatherCoin.I will call it HeliumCoin.4 times as many coins as FeatherCoin which has4 times as many coins as LiteCoin which has4 times as many coins as Bitcoin.Bitcoin: GoldLiteCoin: SilverFeatherCoin: BronzeHeliumCoin: AluminumIt should catch on well (as long as nobody comes up with a smarter plan to have an alt coin with 4 times as many HeliumCoins...VacuumCoin). My work blocks the site.Category: Malicious Sources This past week has been the closest we have seen of stability for a long time.The Speculation section is fairly boring these days. I have a Rhodium tooth. Working on it. It is called seasteading and the only legal regulations are if you are within 200 miles of any nation. Outside of that, it is open and free. Expect an announcement in the next few weeks.Something to whet the appetite.http://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/PrivateProvision.pdf Everything on the Internet.
Maybe https://bitspend.net ?Works for me. I am in Afghanistan so my food is provided, but Amazon has similar prices on their groceries as the store and they deliver for free. You can order anything on Amazon via bitspend. The guy cannot buy both for 155.His order will go through on the 150 USD order and sit there with an buy @155 while the other guy has a sell at @160.I would be pissed if I put on an exchange that I am willing to sell my bitcoin for $160 and the exchange sold it to some guy for $155. As opposed to what? Making enough to spend government currency for what I need?I have moved on from government currency. Edit: I see what you are asking. I do not get paid in bitcoins, I convert every paycheck. Everything I buy online.http://bitspend.net I used to be able to move the price of bitcoin a few ticks on my own with $10k a few years ago. It was much more vulnerable then to volatility. Now that $10k would be just a blip taken over by a few traders.Now there is big money coming in and moving the price. In a few years that big money will be just a blip.  Whole governments will need to throw their money at bitcoin to have any affect.Then they will be just a blip. I just noticed this yesterday when downloading gimp.I figured it must have been old news. Gimp rocks. Coming soon. Sorry, it is bitspend.netYou can buy anything on the Internet with bitcoins. Go to a mirror...see an early adopter. It currently is. Which is like MtGox being a single point of failure.BitSpend seems like it requires such a small start up cost to get going that we will see more sites like that in the near future.There is already bitsumo which does the same thing, though I have not tried them out yet. Initially there was a chicken and egg thing. People were not spending bitcoins because there were no merchants to spend their bitcoins at. Merchants were not accepting bitcoins because people were not spending bitcoins.Now BitSpend comes out and allows you to spend bitcoins on anything on the Internet. For me, I used to go search for Bitcoin merchants before I purchased something online. Now I just go search for the best deal online and buy it through BitSpend.In theory, as long as MtGox will exchange my government currency for bitcoins and BitSpend will convert my bitcoins for products, and miners mine to keep Bitcoin going, then Bitcoin can be used as a currency.Sure, it would be nice for the Bitcoin economy if the consumer and merchant used bitcoins, but as a consumer, I get what I need out of the deal.The fee to use BitSpend is certainly not ideal, but they will be coming out with a $5/month subscription service to use it which is quite fair.So, can we stop worrying about "X company now accepts Bitcoin!", since pretty much every company on the Internet now accepts Bitcoin? The way that inflation is created by government currency creates inflation for the poor and shields the wealthy from inflation.With bitcoin the playing field is even. And an economy of savers helps to stave off the need for a safety net for everyone which helps to enslave the poor. I am quite pleased with the return on the loans I give out. Currently getting 19% return compounded daily. If everything is rigged.Then the Bitcoin price is rigged!  Done.http://www.bitspend.netNext question?Edit: .com to .net How many collectives do you group people into? It must be like a Disney movie in your head with the characters you paint of the differing groups. What is wrong with deflation? Hmm, you use collectivism in your argument about collectivism.Fail.The Free State Project was started shortly after George Bush was elected.The correlation is that during an election season some people who love liberty hold out the hope that the voting public will finally wake up. When they go forward and prove their hatred of freedom in the voting booth, those who seek liberty find other ways outside of the political realm. The guy was not able to hold off the people outside? What kind of guns did he have?
Instead of investing, convert dollars to bitcoins. Ok, my paycheck is in now...you can all buy back in now.BUY BUY BUY!!! I took a second bitcoin mortgage out on my house and sold them all for dollars.SELL SELL SELL!!! You can short on margin at BitFinex.A great way to make money if you are a bear. $2 Seems like we will be mired in the $150s for a long time... If Bitcoin is like reverting back to digital gold, then perhaps the next thing will be a digital version of trading a fish for two apples. I was actually just about to post the same thing due to my supercomputer running numbers. You beat me to it and likely have already benefitted financially from it. In order to keep from getting campaign funds from foreigners candidates are supposed to get the name and address of every donor. Even when accepting bitcoins as another New Hampshire candidate discovered a few years ago. I would emphasize Bitcoin as a currency to be spent as opposed to a stock to buy and sell.Some people are put off by Bitcoin's volatility as compared to government currency but you can show that with unit cost averaging, over time the price is stable and if they use it as a currency instead of holding government currency then their purchasing power grows over time as opposed to shrinking. When the dollar crashes you will be jumping to Bitcoin's current stability. You can say good-bye to American online retail companies.You will be buying most of your goods from the Bahamas from now on. Contribute with something from your own background.If you play poker professionally you may want to work with someone on a poker tournament or something you are familiar with since you have a good understanding of what that world consists of. Bitcoin is not yet ready for a large company such as PayPal unless they go through BitPay (And I doubt BitPay is ready for that many PayPal transactions).Right now most Bitcoin businesses have a single person or a few trusted people who have access to cold storage wallets. A huge company like PayPal would have to figure out how to allow an accounting department to have access to private keys without someone just logging in at home and draining their wallets. Some people send ASCII numbers via satoshis. Actually, the town I used to live in had a private fire department. No taxes went toward putting fires out at people's houses. And that fire department was rated one of the highest in the state for safety giving all home owners in town a lower rate on their home owner's insurance.I will not explain here how they were paid because if given a bit of thought, people can come up with ways that government services can be paid for without force.But just getting the money at the point of a gun is easiest and requires no thought.How would you  create a private fire department? However you need to justify it. I know that it is wrong to initiate force. But I understand that tyranny exists because people accept it in exchange for goodies. I am from a planet where using force against someone to take their money is considered a bad thing.Will it be ok if someone steals your money at the point of a gun on your way home tonight? Forcing people to hand over their money is not evil? Awesome. This should just about close the loop on my requirement for fiat.Though, the fees are a bit steep. About half would be reasonable, but with no competition they are able to charge those types of fees.If I put my mortgage payment in bitcoins instead of my bank account, the price would have to rise from the current $146 to $153 to break even. Certainly worth it (at the current rate) considering I usually have my $ sitting in my account for a week before I send the check.
So...do not keep us in suspense. What grade did they get? I cannot access this site from work but I just saw this:http://bitboin.comSupposedly they accept credit cards to buy bitcoins?From a google screen shot it appears like some rudimentary wordpress page that is very simplistic.Though, what is there to worry about getting scammed since you can always do a charge back if you receive no coins. Not if I can help it! Have you noticed a Scammer tag with a bunch of red XXXXs under some people's names?Go check a few threads in Lending, you will see plenty. I was figuring I would just pay for my next phone card using bitspend.netMaybe even buy a new phone as well. As long as I can use my bitcoins to buy things, I do not care what people call it. The guy who took bitcoins for pizza creates far too much uncertainty in the market.Did he immediately turn around and use it for hamburgers? Or did he hoard it? We do not know this and thus live in daily fear of such an unknown. Says the real hacker. I am curious to know what the guy was trying to accomplish? Broken windshield?[/quote]From another site: If you want to day trade right, trade on margin somewhere like BitFinex. Screw buying low and selling high. Buy low at your money times 10 and sell high at your money times 10.And be sure to short when you think the price will fall. Shorting on Bitfinex is cheaper because the loan rates are lower. Go do it now! Has anyone looked into tearing down the right edge of that mountain to get rid of murder? Someone should really look into that. Um, I do not know what conclusions you all have come to on whether or not interest can be made from bitcoin, but I am glad that I can make money on the interest I charge for loaning out my bitcoin.I am currently getting about 19% interest yearly on 25 BTC compounded daily. I worked on such radio mesh networks for the military. It is certainly possible.Even easier if you have nodes that are not mobile, but certainly do-able.I would like to see a time when people buy solar mining rigs that also act as a bridge  on the mesh network which they can just mount on telephone poles or tall trees all over their town and anywhere else they can find to stick them.There is even a solar spray paint now so you could just spray paint the top of the telephone pole and if you make the device small enough to go un-noticed (or make it look like part of the pole) it would probably stay there for years. But they are still people who legally have to pay income tax on their earnings or else they will go to jail. Staying out of society just means you are good at evading your kidnappers for a while.But you can choose if you want heart surgery but not hand surgery. For a little bit longer medical treatment is still private.Again, it falls back to what government provides instead of acknowledging that the money comes via force. Look at the stock market as compared to the federal reserve setting interest rates. When the federal reserve lowers rates, the stock market jumps. When the federal reserve raises rates, the stock market drops. The theory is that with lower rates, more money will be pumped into the economy and the big companies will be getting more money.So when the Fed board releases a rate increase or decrease, immediately people in the stock market react as quickly as possible one way or another.Now imagine if the people of the stock market consisted of a bunch of people with extra money to play on the market. Kids taking out college loands to invest, families taking money out of their credit cards to invest, people with a few extra bucks here and there. Maybe one or two people who understand the way things always work.Now, Bernanke comes out and says "we are raising interest rates". Imagine if those people who have all of their money invested in the stock market have no clue what that means and do not really care one way or another. They just got another paycheck that they can invest so they put more money into the stock market and the stock market goes up.How could this be. Most experts would expect it to go down since that is the pattern. But the people buying do not care about the pattern, they do not follow the charts, they just buy or sell based on their own ideas of what the price should be.Technical Analysis is a self fulfilling prophecy. Everyone knows that something goes up or down because of that analysis so they trade accordingly, which then re-affirms that analysis.Bitcoin investors do not care. They see it going up or down based on a multitude of factors and buy or sell on their own whims. That is why TA does not work very well with Bitcoin. Ok, that is fine. I just see far too often people complaining that using Bitcoin to not pay taxes should result in that person not being able to use any of the government services. As if it is hypocritical.But when it comes down to it, the theft is what I have issue with. Not what you do with the loot. I am not against government services, though I believe it can be done more efficiently if paid per use, but if the money is gained voluntarily then I have no issue with it.I do have issue when someone steals from me under threat of being kidnapped and imprisoned. That part people seem to gloss over as a necessary evil to get all of those free goodies. You say that there is no place to short bitcoins but Bitfinex is up and running using your code from Bitcoinica.Have you checked that out? We would likely not care one bit about people drunk on the roads if it were not for the fact that the ancient government road technology has not been improved upon in over 100 years.Telephones were only a government monopoly and hardly changed technology for 50 years. We have come a long way since the monopoly was lifted. Imagine if we had done the same with roads at the time. People would not be driving their cars anymore, the smart roads would. The biggest thing I could think of is that they know how to crack the encryption. They should still be charged. If it is found to be the person's fault then they should be convicted.
Anyone who kills someone else while driving should be charged with manslaughter. I do not understand, are you trying to use a statement from last year when BitPay made $170k and Silk Road made $180k to trump the statement that BitPay made $5 million and Silk Road made $2 million...last month? So it is ok to get government services without paying for them? Exactly, if an oil company wants a government service, they should just pay for that service instead of making the rest of us pay for it. Why would you pay for that? So...some people who do not pay income taxes should be eligible to use government services? That is fine. As long as they do not use the services paid for by taxpayers. So, do they not use government services? If I am being robbed in the alley, how is it moral or immoral for me to hand over my money?Most people believe that it is moral to rob someone. They go out of their way to justify that morality with things like roads and schools and firemen. But they are still justifying theft. So those people do not want to contribute their fair share? I cannot wait until people who do not pay taxes are kicked out of the country.How do they get to work? Private roads?But at least those 49% who do not pay taxes are advocating for less government and more privatization...right? So they would at least be consistent.What, they actually do not pay taxes and yet still overwhelmingly vote for bigger government? How could this be so?That would make people who do not want to pay taxes but actually want a government that reflects no taxes...consistent. While the rest would be...freeloaders. So...will we be testing with test bitcoins or will you be providing us with the coins necessary for testing?I doubt anyone will put their coins on your site without a lot of reason to trust you.Other than that, I would like to help test it. I am currently receiving interest on a small amount of my bitcoins but would like to explore every option. It is morning in Japan. The following statement has been approved by CISPA:I love paying taxes. I have not yet had any gains on my bitcoins but when I do I will be the first one at the tax office to pay my fair share. They also like to call Satoshi a hacker.They are obviously trying to mean it in the new evil connotation but he does not even fit the original definition.I could see if Bitcoin was created from piecing together parts of other computer programs but it is an original creation. Completely likely to be just some kid who thinks posting stupid stuff is fun. AKA most of 4chan.Saw it on another thread, checked the reditt to grab the meat of it. ===OPERATION SHOCK AND AWE===Date: Monday 2013-04-22===Start time of event: 15:30 UTC===Goal: Bring bitcoin price < $30 US dollarshttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1cu4ck/ridiculous_ddos_operation_set_up_for_monday/DDOS prevention is pretty limited these days, I wish there were better solutions than cloudlfare, they do not seem to be cutting it.I am worried that once my site is up I will have to deal with the same stuff and am not sure how to handle DDOS. Certainly. Like bitspend allows you to buy any product even if it is priced in government currency.But even a few years down the road people will need to pay things like property taxes and other taxes in government currency. So it would still serve a purpose. I believe fundamentals will be easier once a steady flow of ASICs is going out and we have a good idea of price compared to mining return on investment.Current profit margin is 46% assuming hardware costs estimated to be $1000 per gigahash every 2 years, and bandwidth $1 per gigahash per year plus power consumption of 650 Watts per gigahash and electricity price of 15 cents per kilowatt hour.With 60 gigahash mining machines coming out, the profit margin is difficult to predict.There is a point where profit margin can go high enough that people will stop buying bitcoins and simply buy mining machines instead. This will keep the price in check. There is no "the Bitcoin", it is simply Bitcoin. When used to refer to the blockchain, protocol or underlying technology it is referred to as Bitcoin (upper case 'B'). When referring to the value of the currency then it is referred to as bitcoin or bitcoins (lower case 'b') like one would refer to dollars with a lower case 'd'.
Their paychecks. Which are paid in government currency. MTGOX exchange tries to manipulate the perception of MTGOX through its public relations. Nothing but good things to say about Bitronic as a hosting service. Good service and better prices than namecheap. Well, it would have to be a service. By bill pay I mean you put in the recipient, address and account number with the amount in dollars, then you pay the equivalent in bitcoins.The service would then send out a check the same way you can do bill pay on an online bank account.Could certainly also set up a wallet client to connect to the service for automated payments. Which is referred to as the short squeeze. Prediction quoted. I recommend BIGMERVE, he does good logo designs and works with you through several proofs until you have what you want. His price is around .24 BTC. Or the price is at $120 and you believe the price will drop to $80. You borrow 100 BTC at 50% yearly interest and immediately sell, the price drops from $120 to $100...did not go as low as you expected but still far enough. You buy back 100 BTC at $100/BTC and pay back your loan. You just made $2,000. You pay about $16.50 for the borrowed BTC for the day and you are set.Happens all the time at BitFinex. I thought the same thing when I checked my address (in my sig). I saw that 12 BTC was moved. I freaked out.Then I remembered that I paid for my hosting service from my BTC client. This sent about 13 BTC out, paid the .6 for the hosting service and returned the 12 or so BTC to a different address (the change).Bitcoin does this on purpose to mix your addresses to help with anonymity.Using a single address is not how it was designed to work.To remedy this I went into my client and sent the full amount in my wallet back to my vanity address.I usually use the few BTC I have on MtGox for spending but that day Gox was lagged up so I had to load my vanity address up to do the spending. Bitcoin Bill Pay!The last piece of the puzzle to get me off of fiat. With the amount of success BitSpend is having with just paying for things for people in cash in exchange for bitcoins, how much of a stretch would it be for someone to come up with an easy bill pay system where they just send out checks in exchange for bitcoins?It seems even easier than what BitSpend does. Someone puts in a name, address, account number and amount. They pay the bitcoin amount and a check is printed out for the business to send out.Could easily do it like bitspend charging for different prices or have a subscription service. Marketing condoms to Bitcoin users is like marketing protractors to football players. Step 1: Post forumStep 2: Step 3: Profit! The price will drop below $115 tomorrow so you should sell.If it does, send me bitcoins for this advice.If it does not, send me a PM for a special consolation prize. In March BitPay had over $5 million in sales go through the site. Silk Road had around $2 million. So basically have someone go through an even longer process than any of the exchanges for the convenience of being able to buy bitcoins with a credit card? A common misconception.I pay my bills with dollars because currently that is the only option. Everything else, I use bitcoins. They do not but it would be cool if they could automate something once you put the URL in and have some options pop up on the bottom with perhaps cheaper items or items for sale in bitcoins which you could then get a discount on buying with their service.But as of now it seems like they are knocking things out pretty well with their current business model. I have over a million satoshis. Or just find the product you want and order it on bitspend.
I imagine it would be similar to the government making buying drugs online with bitcoins illegal. Check out OKPay.There are a few other companies working on bitcoin debit cards. Once ASICs come out mining will cease because of too much mining. Oh nos...then I guess Silk Road was shut down? And to weep for an America you were once proud of. What will we do if the government bans the sale of drugs in exchange for bitcoins? A nice dinner: http://www.foodler.com/Cigars (via bitspend): http://www.cigarsdirect.com/Wine (via bitspend): http://www.wine.com/And you can watch your spending money grow before you place your order.  I will wait to see the thread on here pointing out this bitcointalk post and how the DEA will be paying this person a visit: We could go back before the stone age before the terrorists developed stones. Do you believe Bitcoin will rise while the dollar falls?If so, the price of bitcoin reaching $10,000 by the end of 2016 is not that huge of a leap (1000+% gains on average for the past 4 years means over $10k/BTC by 2015).If you bet just .5 BTC (about $60 at current rates) on this:http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532it is like an investment in your future. When the bet is won, you will likely at least double your money since so many people believe it will not reach $10,000.So if you win you will get back at least $10k worth of bitcoins. If you lose, you are out 60 bucks.And the earlier you bet, the larger the cut of the winnings you receive. So betting now will give you more than those that wait.Easy money. Or the bears could bet against the price of Bitcoin going up to $10,000 in the next few years:http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532 One word: volume Yes, I hope that Somalia continues to be thrust upon us as a place where no government exists. I hope they remember that when Somalia is one of the major African countries and surpasses many others.Even though the UN is doing everything they can to suppress their advances. Huge government spending items would not be purposefully created in order to ensure deficits which benefit the central banks.This includes war. I have noticed this being mentioned more in the government media lately.Taking either the original definition of hacker or the newer derogatory term for hacker, Satoshi does not fit either.He wrote a computer program on his own computer and then released it to the world.The original term for hacker referred to someone who would go into other people's computer systems to check things out and discover things that other people were doing, even hacking into a software program to see what it does and change things to learn more about it.The new media term refers to people who break through security of other people's computer systems and cause mischief.Satoshi was neither.Am I to be considered a hacker because I write computer programs for my company? Why is it that whenever someone talks about not paying taxes, someone inevitably has to mention the fact that they are going to get audited or they are going to go to jail. That is sort of a given is it not? Why perpetuate the IRS's fear game for them?When someone online talks about smoking pot or doing drugs it is not immediately followed by "You're so going to get a visit from the cops and your ass is going to be in jail".Why is breaking one law followed by reminders of jail while breaking another law is just considered living your life differently than others? It will not matter since this forum will not be around when Bitcoin crashes to zero tomorrow. The thing is, the only resistence point is $266.We have been through everything from here to there already. No psychological barriers. It is a hoax. It is done. I believe they shut down the blockchain today from lack of use. It was nice while it lasted.
To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love Bitcoin is to know and love the fact that Bitcoin is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a millibit, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of Bitcoin and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of Bitcoin are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it. Yep, they have just popped up recently and from the sound of it they are catching on very well.They have their own subreddit here:https://reddit.com/r/bitspendI see them as a good business like BitPay. BitPay is working with merchants to get them to start accepting bitcoins. BitSpend is working with consumers to get them to start spending bitcoins. The better they both do, the better off we will be in the long run.And it allows me to more easily move out of government money. The easy way to accept bitcoin donations for political campaigns is to require the donor to include their name, age, occupation, etc. which is required for a cash donation.The guy in New Hampshire did that after seeking the advice of the secretary of state. I was always told that 420 was the police code for busting someone with weed. It was all a lie! As much as it pains me to say it, Bitcoin is not yet ready for a Western Union sized business to use Bitcoin.They live in the world of fiat money and fiat accounting structures. They are able to balance credits and debits and show money on paper that they do not actually have, and still be able to spend that fictitious money because it will be there in the future.They would have to do a huge infrastructure change to deal in a currency that has to exist to be spent. And they would have to come up with some huge operational steps to allow people or systems access to private keys to move bitcoins.We are definitely in beta when it comes to companies using bitcoins. We have seen the early results when people did not yet use cold storage.It would not be as simple as them just starting to accept bitcoin at their kiosks or paying out bitcoin in exchange for cash. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324493704578431000719258048.htmlFull article: I did get one of my BTC loans returned to me. Must have hit someone.Now that it is so high, time to borrow more for the big crash! Borrow borrow borrow!!! That is funny. A virus fighting virus attack. Maybe reset their background to a picture of the lone ranger with a message "Your system is now free from bad guys" Plus watching it go every which way but loose is quite entertaining. I would imagine you would have to order your weed a few days prior to 4/20 to celebrate on 4/20. I hacked their API page. It is now gone and gives a 404 error when trying to connect.Now give me some canadian bitcoins. I have done this for a few people. I just tell them, the two things you have to worry about are trusting me and your e-mail account that I sent it on.Usually it is just a small amount so they are not too worried.Just tell them if they want a truly secure address that you can help them do it later once they are more comfortable with how things work. MtGox could also check the logs to see who consistently sells before or early into a DDOS attack and buys near the end of the attack.They may be able to discover a pattern. The irony is that the anonymity of Bitcoin would likely keep us from tracking the source.The most likely scenario is that someone who wants to buy a bunch of bitcoins or has a bunch and wants to play the market just hops onto Silk Road, finds someone with 1000 bots for rent. They pay them a couple hundred bucks in bitcoins, they get temporary control over them and start hitting MtGox. They sell their BTC as the value starts to drop and they put a buy order in at a lower price. Once they hit their buy they pull the bots and the price starts to climb back up. Easy money.So, to track this person down you would find the source of the bots. This is likely a bunch of random computers with a virus. Even if you could track down the person who created the virus, the actual person who started the DDOS paid in bitcoins.Or you could use the transparency of Bitcoin to find out what the cost of a DDOS would be, look for a transaction on the blockchain within a day of the DDOS that is close to that price. Then try to track the source address to see who it is. I will definitely check that out as well (I cannot access it from work).I like the concept and am glad there will be more than one choice. I just bought some organic dog food online yesterday with BitSpend. Quite cool.I plan on making all of my online purchases with bitcoins from now on.I like that they are planning on doing a subscription service. You can now buy pressure cookers with bitcoins!http://silkroad.com/illegalstuff/weapons/pressurecookers Atlas Shrugged But I cannot spend JCPenny stock on websites. Softcore lounge...does this mean no market penetration?
Through unit cost averaging volatility goes out the door. I plan on purchasing everything in the future with bitcoin. So the latest craze of the government media is to attack Bitcoin for its volatile price with regards to Federal Reserve Notes. One article I just read stated that the price went from $40 to $266 and back to $40 within days.So, why does this or does this not matter for someone who actually uses Bitcoin as a currency?Two people: Dollar spender and Bitcoin spender. Both get paid in dollars.Dollar spender:Friday pay check - $2,000. It goes into his account and he spends half on bills and reserves the other half for spending.Wednesday - buy $200 boots onlineThursday - buy $400 stereo online Sunday - buy  $200 computer monitor Total spent for the week: $2,000Bitcoin spender: Friday pay check - $2,000. It goes into his account and he spends half on bills and sends the other half off to the exchange.Monday morning - converts $1,000 to X bitcoins at Y price.Wednesday - buy $200 boots online (price went down to Y/2, costs $400 worth of his original BTC)Thursday - buy $400 stereo online (price went up to Y*2, costs $200 worth of his original BTC)Sunday - buy  $200 computer monitor (price up for the week the average weekly gain of 10%, Y*1.1, $182 worth of his original BTC)Total spent for the week: $1982Think of a casino who puts a roulette table out. One player plays 5 rounds at $10 each bet on red. He may hit it big, he may lose it all or somewhere in the middle. Either way, it is unpredictable. Why would the casino owner put out such a volatile game? Because 5000 people putting $10 on red each day would end up with the house advantage averaging out to a couple percent per bet.If you convert each paycheck to bitcoins and spend as you would your regular dollars, if you understand dollar cost averaging, any fluctuation evens out over time. And the fact that Bitcoin is a deflationary currency that gains in value, it means that the value of your money will gain a slight percentage over time as opposed to fiat money which is purposefully inflationary. Only put money on online wallets that you are willing to lose.Store your savings offline with something like the Armory wallet or generating your own public/private key with VanityGen or at the very least use the standard client and encrypt your wallet.For spending money you can use online wallets like blockchain.info or any of the other established exchanges. I keep a few BTC on MtGox for spending money. Even Super PACs need to verify that donors are not donating from outside of the country. Almost every sentence if FUD. That may be the only way we get freedom in America.A long dark age of socialism to teach them what it is like. Liberal going on a liberal talk show to talk about Bitcoin?Will there be anyone there to defend Bitcoin? What kind of services? You mean MtGox? How is that any different from BitPay who allows merchants to accept bitcoins then converts those bitcoins into dollars for them?This service allows people like me who would rather not use dollars switch over and leave the dollar.Chicken and egg, the more people convert to only using bitcoins, the more merchants switch over.So...ya, one side of the equation is taken care of. You can buy anything on the Internet with bitcoins.Do you plan on ever buying anything on the Internet?http://www.bitspend.net That too...you can always verify the PGP signature to make sure the binary is not compromised as well as running it offline. I like to do this:Download the Vanity Generator (https://github.com/downloads/samr7/vanitygen/vanitygen-0.22-win.zip)Run the vanity generator:C:\>vanitygen.exe 1JoshDifficulty: 4476342Pattern: 1JoshAddress: 1JoshvL2trzgd5PPmA8rj4M9xKz3o2Xek3Privkey: 5Jdx2v395JTGJCE5uw6ukfGz8otQ7hT7Y64xpZiBfBhn2WRCdpVTake the Address and copy it to wherever you want, send it to yourself in an e-mail, put it in your forum signature, whichever...Take the Privkey and do whatever you feel is the the safest way of securing it. Write it down on a piece of paper, print it out, stamp it into metal, scratch it into the floor under your bed, whichever. That is the key to spending your money.The only way someone could hack you this way is if they have a screen capture type of virus. Or you could run that program on a computer that is not ever going to be connected to the Internet ever again if you are super paranoid. You are all set. Send all of your bitcoins to your Address. If you need to spend you can use the standard bitcoin client to spend using your private key. I am currently in Afghanistan but my mother is taking care of my dogs. My mother is retired so I do not want her to have to spend a lot of money on the dogs so I take care of their expenses.I am also making a bit more money than I used to so I can stop giving them the processed nasty food (that is probably contributing to my dog's alergies and itching). So I decided to get them some good healthy organic dog food with no preservatives. After checking out different companies I decided to try http://www.orijen.ca/ brand dog food. Their site has a list of online vendors.I went to their online vendors and found the one with the best price and free shipping.I found the dog food I wanted. Copied the product page link. Pasted the link into the easy form at http://www.bitspend.net and put my mother's address in there and placed my order.A few hours later bitspend got back with me and gave me an invoice with a bitcoin payment link. I clicked on the link and paid with my bitcoin client.Quite simple, order placed and my dogs get some quality dog food. I did not need to search for bitcoin merchants, I could go with the best product I could find on the Internet. No more need to spend dollars on the Internet anymore. Will the crash affect my ability to purchase things online with my bitcoins? Early on there was little attention paid to security because there was a small group of people involved. Imagine living in a house with a bunch of roomates and putting a lock on the refrigerator. It was unneccesary.Then after a theft or two people started considering security. A lot of people would use encryption programs on their wallet and decrypt whenever they needed to send bitcoins. But that was a hassle.Finally they included the option to encrypt your wallet right in the bitcoin client. That helped a lot.Then there are the merchants getting hacked. This problem stems from companies having many people with access to the bitcoins which would allow any one of them to take it and claim a "hack". One exchange was hacked as they were transferring the business to someone that bought them out but the wrong person was given the password and they were able to get access.I believe there is still some work to be done on the business level for securing bitcoins. Many are doing well with the cold storage solution but there is more that can be done.The armory client was created to give a solution to security.I personally prefer to just create a public and private key and protect the private key my own way. The interesting thing I got from the crappy movie they did about her was to note that trying to force everyone to pay the same tax rate is political suicide.That pretty much shows that we will continuously slip further and further into tyranny of the people.  Jesus was an albino. This is often missed in historical accounts.They also skipped out the whole part in the bible where he was a ninja master. Bitcoin is anonymous if you want it to be. There are different reasons allowed for chargebacks depending upon the time that goes by. There are some that are allowed within 7 days, some within 75 days.
It was hard enough for them to try to restart their business with a huge debt hanging over their heads that they were promising to repay with their profits.An early company needs to be able to put their profit into the business for a while.I liked BitFloor, they allowed for easy deposit through ING and paid you to exchange your funds. The only reason I did not sign up is knowing that they were in the hole and would likely never be able to make it.It sucks since they really support Bitcoin and were trying to do the right thing by paying people back after the hack. I have been on BitFinex consistently for the past week or so loaning BTC to bears like you. It has been up the whole time. The site is actually easier for me to connect to than MtGox.Maybe the site is closer to me in Afghanistan than MtGox. We still have the weekend dip coming. If it does not rise too much today and tomorrow it may come back to the 80s or so. I would go. I loled You mean like this?https://www.bitfinex.com/pages/ll_order_book I get paid in fiat. So if I have monthly expenses those are taken care of with FRNs if I cannot pay with bitcoins.Other than that, I convert all the rest to bitcoins.I reserved 1 bitcoin to pay off my mortgage. Though I would rather just pay a mortgage company in bitcoins. Good luck with that. The fact remains that most people have credit cards and do not understand the whole thing about jumping through so many hoops just to get a bitcoin.Paying for risk is part of how the market works. People are willing to take risks in exchange for money.A rating per person would make it easier like on BTCJam where people are willing to loan out bitcoins to people who could disappear. Good point. Though I guess in theory that would just be part of the risk that people would have to compensate for. The earliest trades would likely be very costly since, as been pointed out, without being established and not knowing the payment processor's stance on it the risk factor is huge. Anything I have done as far as looking into the bitcoin time lock capabilities is that it is mainly client side and you are basically freezing your own funds from your client which then has to unfreeze the funds when the time comes. The key part of that is that they could get bitcoins if they are willing to pay more. Buy 1.2 BTC for $120 then trade your red coin for a full bitcoin worth $100.1 bitcoin on ebay is going for over $110 (at the current exchange rate of $60). Interesting. The product being sold is a red token. I wonder how video game sites like Second Life do it.I had a payment processor but do not recall them asking what I would be selling (maybe they did, I do not recall). There are many people frustrated with figuring out how to get into bitcoins. It has been shown that people who use PayPal would be willing to spend more per BTC than those going through the exchanges.The main reason people will not exchange bitcoins via credit cards is because of chargebacks, you could give someone your bitcoins after they pay with a credit card only to have them disappear with your BTC and get their money back onto their card leaving you with nothing.Most credit card companies have different time scales for different charge backs, the longest being 120 days (from a quick check on Visa).So, what if we had an exchange that allowed you to pay with a credit card and when you do the purchase the exchange buys bitcoins on your behalf but holds them for you for 120 days. What you receive instead is a bitcoin equivalent credit or colored or slightly transparent coin (however the site wants to do it).But what you can do with these coins once you get them is trade them on that exchange. Based upon the amount of time that has passed from the time you bought them to the time they actually get switched out for real bitcoins they will vary in value based upon what people are willing to pay.Say bitcoin is $100/BTC. You go to pay with your credit card and pay $100 (plus credit card fees). You buy 1 BTC for $100. The site buys 1 BTC at $100 and pegs it to your purchase and gives you a red 4 month coin.You notice on the site that someone is willing to trade .8 bitcoins for a red 4 month coin. You need the bitcoins for something else so you do the trade.Now the guy with the red 4 month coin holds the coin for a month so it is now an orange 3 month coin. He notices that someone is willing to trade .8 light green 2 week coin for an orange 3 month coin. He has a bitcoin hosting service payment coming up in 2 weeks so he makes the trade.He waits 2 weeks and the light green coin turns dark green until the final day of the 120 days it turns into a solid bitcoin which the site then transfers to the holder of the coin. He can now take the coin out and use it in his wallet for whatever he wants.The original person could have waited the 120 days to get the one bitcoin as well. But people would be motivated to trade based upon the risk of someone doing a charge back. You could even have credit ratings for each person based upon amount of trades and if they have ever done a charge back.It would allow for easier entry into using bitcoins on the trading side allowing people to pay extra to use their credit card to buy bitcoins (users could be willing to trade their full bitcoin for 1.2 red 4 month bitcoins from an AAA rated seller for example).Thoughts? I like to check periodically for how many coins are required to be in the top 410.It used to be 1-2k would be enough. Now 3k is the low end.I guess that is party a factor of more bitcoins in the system? Or would it be watching in real time the effect of the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer? We all blamed bad things on "the manipulator". Got someone in your pocket? Ahh...someone who actually understands what the term regulate means.Your professor would not. In liberal speak, to regulate is to use the government to make something better.As opposed to during the days when your rifle would be "well regulated" if it was in proper working order and checked to make sure it would shoot if needed. It was that definition they meant when talking of a well regulated militia in the Constitution. If it is for a university paper you will do well to bash the hell out of Bitcoin and highlight things such as "its creator is an unknown person!" and "a depreciating currency is bound to fail because nobody will spend".You are well on your way with your response that old people should be taken care of by the state. Being a university paper I would also expand that to include minorities and the poor and lower middle class.Here are some buzz words:Keynesponzi schemebubbleunregulatedA+ for sure. (I used to write outlandishly liberal papers for high grades to get through college myself, gotta look out for number 1) I guess it would mean more dollars per BTC.
Ya, but my last 3-4 paychecks have been going toward saving up to pay the IRS.Now that the IRS is paid I have many more paychecks ahead of me for buying as opposed to the one small(ish) buy I made in early February.Consistent moving of dollars into bitcoins enables consistent purchasing goods and services with bitcoins. No matter the price. Yours is white.I was going to ignore you at one point because I was tired of seeing the word bubble.But you have been consistent and are not combative about it. I have the same amount of coins from before it started going up and the same amount of coins coming back down (outside of my regular spending).Feels good. Corner the market and do what with it? Bitpay allows people to pay with bitcoins and you can either keep it in bitcoins or get the dollar rate at that time. Why would you have to worry about the rate? Other, more important things, have been in the works.http://www.talkbitcoins.com/talk-bitcoins/founder-of-bitinstant-accepts-bitcoins-at-his-new-york-city-bar/114/ Someone else gave an interview a few years ago (Gavin maybe) who said that any regulation should be at the exchange level.They regulate everything that has to do with their dollars anyway, this is not a huge leap. That would be unlikely because of chargebacks. My next alt coin will not allow for transactions. Just a set amount of addresses that you can buy and sell at the exchange.It is going to be awesome. So...a tax to end pools.Ok.Or run your pool in another country. No more Bitcoin revenue for your country.See what happens to your community when you regulate/tax one of your main industries:http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_23024668/porn-film-permits-have-dropped-dramatically-l-county Interesting. I used to work for IBM and can see where their motivation is (hint: lucrative military contracts).The Patriot Act and NDAA got rid of many of the barriers to collecting information on Americans. I would expand on it but...non-disclosure and all that. Why does liberty always come down to the discussion of roads?There have been roads for centuries. Government does not have a monopoly on the road idea. Perhaps you have not seen my article about what currency should be.A currency should be shiny, flexible, waterproof, aromatic and tasty.Bitcoin is none of these. That is why it will fail. Forum: http://www.bitcointalk.org lol You are right. I tried to log in to the blockchain and the site is down.It was good while it lasted folks.I am buying all paper money because I no longer trust digital currency.  I am freaking out! I cannot calm down!I slit my wrists twice but it is not working. You are supposed to cut just below the back of your hand right. It just hurts.I lost all of my 10 million bitcoins when the price crashed. Oh the humanity! Long live bitcoin! The price will be a million dollars by June. But you may want to sell before next week because it will be worth .00001 dollars next Wednesday (when my paycheck reaches MtGox).See how that works?And people buy and sell based upon statements like that. I am SO telling your girlfriend ruining the surprise.j/k Congrats.
With the price dropping so low...SURELY it can never reach $10,000.So you may want to bet against it. Some easy bitcoin to be made on a sure thing. $100! That can buy you a decent car.Oh wait...it used to be able to buy a car.Now you can buy a coffee at Starbucks. The voters have the choice every election. They just like to choose evil (the lesser of two). They are following SEC rules on accredited trading.The federal securities laws define the term accredited investor in Rule 501 of Regulation D as:1. a bank, insurance company, registered investment company, business development company, or small business investment company; 2. an employee benefit plan, within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, if a bank, insurance company, or registered investment adviser makes the investment decisions, or if the plan has total assets in excess of $5 million; 3. a charitable organization, corporation, or partnership with assets exceeding $5 million; 4. a director, executive officer, or general partner of the company selling the securities; 5. a business in which all the equity owners are accredited investors; 6. a natural person who has individual net worth, or joint net worth with the persons spouse, that exceeds $1 million  at the time of the purchase, excluding the value of the primary residence of such person; 7. a natural person with income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent years  or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year; or 8. a trust with assets in excess of $5 million, not formed to acquire the securities offered, whose purchases a sophisticated person makes.  When I supported Harry Browne in 2000 as the Libertarian Party presidential candidate my thought was "if only he could get in the debates and people hear his ideas, then he would surely win".Then in 2008 Ron Paul was allowed into the debates. Surely once people heard about a solution that offered them freedom and liberty they all got on board right? Well, you saw how that went.We are fighting the same mentality that was fighting Ron Paul's campaign."Wow, I can make a bunch of money with bitcoins? Sign me up! Oh, it dropped? Then what good is it? It does what with the banks...liberty...what? No thanks, I already have dollars which everyone accepts. The government may have some bad people on the other side but all in all they are working well enough. Besides, I read an article about how bitcoin is a ponzi scheme." They are catering to the truly wealthy and licensed financial institutions.By truly wealthy you have to have over $200k salary for at least two years.This is not their policy, they are trying to follow US trading rules for their setup. I have not followed recently but I believe BitInstant was working on one and Bitcoin-Central said that since they are teamed with a payment processor they would be able to eventually get one out.There was someone else in the Project Development working on a Bitcoin payment processor but that has since gone away. And there is OKPay. I would be interested in a bitcoin -> EagleCash card if it were ever to be possible. This is true, you are trusting every merchant that you give your credit card to to not steal from you.I had a card swiper and I actually used my computer to take care of the transaction. It showed the numbers I needed and everything.It would have been very easy to go in any day or night and just punch in more charges for anyone's credit card purchase.However, they would get a statement saying "Heidi Jo's Boutique: $56.23, $200, $200, $500, $500, ...".It would not be very difficult to figure out that I was stealing and track me down to get the money back and put me in jail.As for Bitcoin debit cards. They are in the works by several different people. Really? Discussions on Marsian bitcoins has already been discussed many times? Gravity perhaps?Too many bitcoins in your wallet and it becomes too heavy to move? It is up on bets of bitcoin now.Though they only accept bitcoins. Do you have any? I agree, you may want to try penny stocks or just go to Vegas.If you are in the market for buying some dollars with your bitcoins, then by all means do so (is there some new enhancement I am not aware of?). The bet, which is still awaiting approval, is:1 Bitcoin will be worth at least $10,000 by 12/31/2016Success of this bet will occur if 1 Bitcoin is valued at $10,000 or more on one of the largest exchanges of the time (based upon top 4 trading volumes/day). The $10,000 is in Federal Reserve Notes (US dollars). Maybe we should instead be focussed on starting to use the Mars underground currency.  I could play roulette 5 times putting my bet on red each time. This could win me a lot of money or lose me a lot of money or come close to even.If I play roulette 5000 times putting my bet on red each time I will more closely get the result of being down 1-2% as the house advantage dictates.If I buy and spend bitcoin every day/week for several years the result will be a slow climb as bitcoin is a depreciating currency.So no, bitcoin is not only suitable as a store of value. Hmm, I wonder if the new Marscoin can be uploaded to those rovers to get it started so they have a currency when they get there. Where do I put a petition to ask Obama to stop stealing my socks? bitspend.net allows you to buy anything on the Internet with bitcoins.If you ever plan on buying anything on the Internet, you may want to change over to bitcoins. We will reach 21 million bitcoins around 2140.More than likely by then we will have colonies on Mars.So the big problem before the need to worry about fees or reaching the maximum amount of bitcoins is.How do we deal with people on Mars using Bitcoin?(This question is as legitimately discussed now in 2013 as discussing how to handle mining in 2140.)
You can buy things on Amazon with bitcoins through bitspend.netI seriously do not have any affiliation with that site but hardly anyone knows about them and they provide the groundbreaking service of allowing you to buy anything on the Internet with Bitcoin.This trumps all of the huge announced websites accepting bitcoin in my eyes. Satoshi Nakamoto does not sound like a British name. Likely why you are going through tough times. You believe that others should be helping you or should be helped instead of looking out for yourself until you are financially stable. Ahh, it looks like it is awaiting approval.I do not see the dollar lasting that long. Bitcoin will be worth more than $10,000 by 2016.If you do not believe this, put your worthless bitcoins where your mouth is at:http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1532 You may want to use bitspend.net to spend it on the Internet. I am going to make a Million Bitcoin page. I was on a satirical over the top website called the obama forums. We would act like Obama supporters and big Democrat supporters throwing out straw men left and right only to have conservatives who could not see through the obviousness go nuts (and threats of lawsuits from a certain jewish organization).We put one post up there about how we need to have the government censor various right wing websites. We mentioned Alex Jones' website as one of those sites.He went on his show shortly thereafter talking about an Obama web forum that was trying to shut down his website.At the very least he does not do his due diligence to check the validity of what he reports. I could go to my Spam folder in my e-mail and report some pretty amazing stories of things going on in the world. But that is about as believable as anything Jones spits out.I tend to see two types of libertarians, those who understand that government just does not work. That pouring more money into something only makes things worse (including wars). Then there is the Alex Jones conspiracy types who believe that government works so well that they are responsible for EVERYTHING in this world down to the color of the juice you drink (blue is turning you gay because the NWO wants you to be).The conspiracy types tend to fight with us against big government, but for different reasons. But they get in the way when trying to have a rational debate. Weak hands looking for 1000% EAZY MONIE OMGZ! GIVE ME COINZ!! will be thinking twice. Alex Jones is a CointelPro working for STRATFOR, a private Zionist intelligence agency located in Austin, Texas.They may has well have hired a clown to act like he is a libertarian to troll us all.He teaches us that the best way to handle those in power is by screaming nonsense into a blowhorn.Here he is disrupting a pro second amendment gathering:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uyIVzdvGi4Share The going rate these days on loaning your BTC to bears (using your money to short) is about 6% yearly return. Of course, to even out the classes you were buying early right?Or even now...you continue to buy while it is cheap?I recall people complaining about early adopters when the price was $8/BTC. If instead of complaining they were buying they would also be early adopters.Remember, there are only enough bitcoins for .006 BTC per person in the world. If you have more than that, you will be in the upper class. There is more than one Federal Reserve Note too.C'mon...it is just FRNs with other names, look at the type of paper and ink used. Quite awesome. Nothing needs to be added to the protocol for this.Coming soon... I plan on making the CommieCoin (tm).Basically all CommieCoins will be equally divided to all addresses. Any spend results in an immediate redistribution. Any new address results in immediate redistribution.It will not require computer power either. Just men in brown coats going anywhere CommieCoins are spent (even in your basement) to verify that everyone has the same amount of CommieCoins.I think it will catch on well. The time to worry is when it is stable.That is the time to sit down and take a deep breath, maybe go for a walk, catch some shut eye. Because soon after that is heart attack roller coaster time. This.The story is more believable than there being a female on the forum. Like I said...force. The bottom feeders are going to come out of the woodwork to chastise the rich. How dare he create a revolutionary new currency and benefit from it.How dare he combine risk, work and thought for reward. Such a thing is unheard of. He should have earned it through favor and force.
People are more concerned with being day traders than exchanging their old currency for a new one. The best way to make money is to take no risk.Just wait until Bitcoin is at a non-risky price and buy as much as you can.I am sure that has done well for people in the past. Current mining:Difficulty: 7,672,99962,172.58 GH/s969.89 megawatt hours$145,483.85 / day3600 bitcoins created / day$145,483 / 3600 = $40.41If you want fundamentals. You cannot charge less for a product than it takes to produce.But for every product you buy you have to consider:cost of production + cost of distribution + cost of retail + cost of marketing  at the very least.Price rarely dips below difficulty for this reason. Bitcoin electricity cost:$149,946.54 / day *http://blockchain.info/stats* Electricity consumption is estimated based on power consumption of 650 Watts per gigahash and electricity price of 15 cent per kilowatt hour. In reality some miners will be more or less efficient. Just tell him to buy enough gold and bitcoin to hold the link for as long as he can keep holding the link...It may get expensive though. This.Same with breast feeding pics. I had a wierd thing happen with me when trying to withdraw less than a bitcoin.I am not sure which fixed it but I logged off, logged back on and put a zero in front of it (like: 0.26 instead of .26). Yes, please go borrow my bitcoins at Bitfinex to do so on margin.Much money for you to make, do not worry about paying a large interest rate for the loan. That sounds like my friend's story. He lives in Poland where all of the exchanges are being shut down. The government is trying to find all Bitcoin users and round them up for prison sentences. He was mining early on so he has over 100,000 bitcoins. He says the police will be there soon and he needs money to get out of the country quick.He is willing to accept a dollar per bitcoin if someone can just wire him the money so he can get out. He is desperate.He even says he will pay half back once he gets out of the country. He just needs your bank account information and your social security number.Please help this desperate soul. Or just pull your Bitcoins out to your wallet. From everything I have seen, Oregon is almost as liberal as Vermont.You are not even allowed to pump your own gas because the government is so into protecting you from yourself. I would add:2.5. If you want to buy something on the Internet, use your bitcoins. What is bad? Remember this simple clue.People who believe it is people who determine the quality of a product and not the product itself will focus on Satoshi and the fact that they cannot judge Bitcoin because they cannot judge Satoshi.If Satoshi was out hobnobbing with celebrities and taking trips to Africa to help starving orphans between trips from London to DC dinner parties then Bitcoin would be the best thing known to man.If Satoshi was some rich guy who likes his solitude in the Montana countryside with his large family, then Bitcoin would be a horrible thing.Because Slate cannot judge the product based upon the man, they must default to it being a scam. That is fine. I just use bitcoins to buy and sell stuff.So, whatever you call something that is used as a means of exchanging goods and services...that is what Bitcoin is. Just started using your site. Interesting. I am glad that I can get some interest on my bitcoins that would have otherwise just been sitting somewhere.But I tried some margin trading and after borrowing some dollars to then trade I put in the order and it just sat there. I put it in at market and the price kept dropping and the order never went through.Either way, I will just stick with lending for now. How many places can you think to store a short string of numbers?Convert to binary, make a binary painting for your wall.Tattoo.Write it in the wet cement of the foundation of your house before building it.Piece of paper in a safe deposit box.Hidden in a jpeg.E-mail it to yourself through "future me".Etch it into something you wear, ring, dog collars, necklace, etc. Reminds me of when I used to dabble in the DIY electric car forums. There was always news about some new battery that would hold 10X capacity "in a few years". Then it would never pan out, but the existing companies would spit out slightly better batteries year after year. As long as MtGox is open long enough every two weeks for me to convert my paycheck out of FRNs then I am fine.Also...there are an awful lot of people complaining about a service that they are not forced to use.The McDonalds in my town closed for 2 days a few months ago for remodeling and I do not recall the people going nuts over it (except one rather large woman on the corner with a sign).There are about 20 other exchanges out there. Vote with your money. That is one of the best things about Bitcoin. The amount of investment that has gone into Bitcoin services built around the protocol. I have paid people to work on my project and put in many hours myself.I am in this for the long haul. The price going up or down over the course of a week means nothing. I convert most of my paycheck to bitcoins and when I can spend using bitcoins, I do. With more and more services being built up, there are starting to be more and more options of where I can spend my bitcoins.Places like http://www.bitspend.net allow me to spend bitcoins anywhere on the Internet.Once they come out with a bitcoin debit card (which is in the works) and a bitcoin bill pay (also in the works), I will be able to drop my bank account and move completely to bitcoins.The only time I will need to use MtGox is every time my paycheck rolls in to convert into my preferred currency.
Ayn Rand is great. I have seen her movies (1 and 2!)Seriously though...Read this post:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=170857.0Actually toward the end, it seems that Bitcoin solves some of the bad things she expresses about money (can be taken, etc). Could be Indiana Jones too. You accidentally posted a picture with your chat with Satoshi...!  You do not send .01BTC increments to the exchange.The bots send a bunch of small transactions within their account on the exchange. The only movement that occurs is within the MtGox database. It does nothing on the Bitcoin network.Otherwise you would have to wait 10 minutes to an hour every time you make a trade (without the lag). Did you steal his wallet? Or Hitler. You cannot DDOS the Bitcoin network.The small transactions you see are probably SatoshiDICE. Stayed exactly the same. I cannot connect to most exchanges from work.Can you include Deposit/Withdraw methods and cost/time if applicable? This is the official thread for listing other exchanges and the steps required to get your fiat in and out of the exchange.I will start.BitFinexhttp://www.bitfinex.comDeposit with:Bitcoin (free)Wire Transfer (your cost will vary, typically $10-$35)Withdraw:Bitcoin (free)Wire Transfer ()Other:Allows lending, margin trading (short, long)-------------------------------------------------I will add as you post. I suppose around 5PM EST. I only had 25 in there left for easy spending. Hmm, I hope it is before I moved my BTC out of MtGox... Went to breakfast. Is MtGox back up? Just be sure to address this: When a follow up was asked of FinCEN, no minimum was included. Anybody  who exchanges bitcoins for fiat is an exchanger.Even at bitcoin-otc or localbitcoins they are exchanging money illegally if doing it in the US without a license.If you plan on trying to do it but stay under the radar then you may want to make sure it will run in Tor and mimick the Silk Road approach. The million+ number for a license came from this thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=154672.0No idea of the source from there. I see those all the time, I could pick some up for free Probably would not be good for the next person walking by though. I can move my bitcoins quite easily. Hmm, everything appears to be connected...
BitInstant:Sure, you can have a decentralized exchange that does not include US citizens. Until the other countries adopt similar laws. zero lag...nice! With FinCEN requiring every currency exchange to register with them paying millions in fees, that would mean that every peer in the exchange would have to pay millions of dollars.See how government created monopolies work? QFT Slate is a ponzi scheme. This is like when I used to watch football but the game did not play in my area so I had to watch it on the Internet.And by "watch", I got to see what the score was and who had the ball. Wait!I was not ready.. You can buy anything online using bitcoin. People ARE shorting on Bitfinex...fortunately taking a loan from my Bitcoins 2 weeks Oh ya, I remember when they took away the fees last time.The spreads were bouncing back from pennies. Yay...a chart! I moved my trading BTC to bitfinex, made .0018 loaning to someone doing a margin short. lol Network Error (tcp_error)  I am lagged out on bitcoinity and gox...what is the price? Bought 200,000 starting at $50...price is back up to $250...woo hoo!!! Going from .000000266 to .000000050 would not be that big of a deal. Most likely Dwolla trades are going through and people's queued bids/asks are getting triggered. All users trying to log in at exactly 2AM UTC to make sure their money is still there will be interesting.
$266the next psychological barrier http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/the-libertarian-party-is-now-accepting-bitcoin-donations/274935/Interesting, this may help to hash out the legality of donating with Bitcoins at the Federal level. If you arbitrage all toward the best prices you could end up with a buttload of brazilian pesos in some obscure exchange. But you got the best price for them, just waiting for someone to buy sell BTC for them. Welcome to Bitcoin. Now that MtGox is not trading for a while, maybe it is a good time to learn a little bit about what you invested in:The White Paperhttp://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfHopefully after you are done investing you will consider trying out the Bitcoin currency. Too many weak hands not understanding Bitcoin. Only understanding +1,000% OMG! HOW DO I BUY!!?! Will the coop pay for all of the fees associated with becoming a currency exchange? The millions of dollars? Someone's money cleared. I do not get paid until next Friday so I all I can do is watch. Those who complain about manipulation are the ones that are easily manipulated. There are 10 types of people out there.Those who understand binary and those who do not. Of the past 3 exchanges, one of them we both agreed on 1 bitcoin no matter the price, one we decided on the dollar equivalent on the day of delivery and the third is my hosting service which charges $66/month which I pay in the equivalent amount of BTC. Who thought Cyprus was funny? It was more like...oh shit.My Bitcoins are still safe in my wallet. Actually I took the last small bit of it out of MtGox yesterday. Spend Like I do every day. Just pay with Bitcoins instead of the local currency. And spending, just paid for my hosting service this morning in bitcoins.  Perhaps I am an Emporer without clothes who is actually a nudist and do not care what others think. Letting the price of bitcoins affect your emotions is the best way to give yourself a heart attack. "You are all dumb" is a pretty broad brush.Someone obviously does not understand what an "individual" is. Not enough. Google stock would be all over the place if the price was being determined by kids using their dad's credit card to buy and sell stocks.It will level out when we use it as a currency and leave the investing to the investors.
So are unrealized losses. A decentralized exchange would require each person converting dollars to Bitcoins or the other way around to become a registered currency exchanger according to FinCEN. This comes will $millions in fees.Gotta love government created monopolies. Unfortunately I know that in 3 days, by the time I get cash into MtGox, the price will be back to normal.Too many people coming into the market for the price to continue down. Maybe we could have a new Bitcoin that allows a Bitcoin committee that determines how many bitcoins are produced, perhaps have them answerable to the government so that they are kept in check. They can stimulate the economy with more bitcoins if the economy slows down and slow it down if things are going too quickly. Maybe they can even have a charter to keep unemployment down, the economy moving and inflation low.This committee would consist of the presidents of bitcoin holding companies that are able to loan out BTC based on a committee determined interest rate. They can even print out cold storage prinouts of the bitcoins that can be a sort of "note" exchangeable for a bitcoin which can be used anywhere you go. Instead of Bitcoin we could just call these notes "Federal Reserve Notes" to make it sound official, like it is a government entity.It just may catch on. I am in it for the money.Money called Bitcoin. Sound advice. I still stand by this. I will be converting my currency with every paycheck and will reserve 1 bitcoin to buy dollars enough to pay off my mortgage.The dollar is too risky. The drama of the Bitcoin price has a whole lot of people doing some crazy things.It is interesting to watch. We have been graced by the Bitcoin gods with a second chance at some cheap coins. It is morning(ish) in China. They get to take away all of your cheap bitcoins you sold. It is doing that two line triangle convergence thing again. I pay for my web hosting site with Bitcoins.Every month I go to their site, whatever the price is at that moment, I pay it.Whether you as a consumer wish to hold dollars and switch in and out of Bitcoin for convenience sake or you are like me and have switched completely over to bitcoins, that is up to you. I figured all of the Keynesians on here spoke to him daily. Have you called Paul Krugman yet? Is he going to start using bitcoins now? So, are you bullish on bitcoins or Federal Reserve Notes?Because it sounds like you are quite gung ho about getting as many of those FRNs as you can. Oh, and please tell me you have not given Alex Jones any of your personal information via his website or through any products you may have purchased through his page. You mean get out of FRNs right? InfoWars is a false flag. Which is why it is so funny saying that my OP talking about how the dollar bubble is about to pop is considered Bearish.And actually I become very bearish about 3 days after my paycheck arrives (for some reason). I pay for my hosting service with Bitcoins. Today is my due date for the month.I will just go on the site, click "pay bill". It will give me the amount of BTC I owe based on the price at that moment and I will pay it.I do not plan on trying to play the market or time things perfectly.I have figured out that if you just move money into Bitcoin when you have it and you spend it without worrying about price you are better off. In the long run the value will do nothing but go up so worrying about 2-3% here and there is pointless.
Yep, entirely possible that they had a cold storage server that is being replaced so they transferred to a new cold storage server. Satoshi is very humble. From the latest press release from MtGox about their new servers...they may have moved wallets. It is almost  From past trends after an MtGox lag price drop, people get skittish and kinda feel things out for a few days. We will have that going into the weekend.The biggest question will be, what happens Monday morning. lol Looks like the idiots trying to pop the bubble got something else instead. Followed by a mass sell off by all. Bitcoinity is back  Ya, it sucks that it never recovered. Where is Paul Krugman when we need him? Is Bitcoin still a deflationary currency?Or will the price continue to drop like the dollar and the Bitcoin economy will flourish? There is no psychological barrier between here and $266. It is April 11 here...I just figured I could see the future. At least $185 (the price two days ago). I cannot imagine who would be worried about "losing tons of money".The price is where it was two days ago. Did someone put in an order for a new yacht yesterday who is now pissed? I agree, there are a lot of people that threw a ton of dollars on the table to get snatched up.There is a reason the top Bitcoin wallets keep getting larger while everyone else is fighting for crumbs. From everything the Keynesians tell me, Bitcoin is deflationary.So in the long run, the value will only go up. I hear penny stocks are a fun place to invest.Bitcoin is a currency. Yes, but I am helpfully pointing the bears to a place where they can put their money.Trading on margin is really the best way to show those silly bulls where they should stick their Bitcoins. (maybe on a trading platform that allows you to loan Bitcoins to bears and get paid for it) I suggest you short Bitcoin on margin at bitfinex if you feel that way...you will be very pleased as it crashes.
As Bitcoin overcomes every little thing thrown at it, it only strengthened people's resolve.So the only flaw that they could come at us with was that the price was in a bubble and that it would crash.Well...pop goes the weasel.When we return to new highs in a day or so...that will be it. What will you have to throw at Bitcoin then?Another bubble that will be recovered from shortly thereafter? Yawn.I wish I was able to buy a bit more to take advantage of this but this thing is going nowhere but up. My send is going through now...all is well on my end. Well, this is the end of Bitcoin. You may as well go sign up on BitFinex and short as much as you can.And you should be willing to pay several 100s of percent in interest when borrowing the Bitcoins you use to short. You will make it all back tenfold on margin anyway so do not worry about it.The more you pay to borrow the more you are sticking it to those silly bulls. So please pay a very high interest rate on those loans. More reason to stay out of the Federal Reserve's realm. Hmm, I assumed it was just because I did not include a transaction fee.Mine has not even registered on blockchain.info as unconfirmed yet. I sent it a few hours ago.(send was from MtGox)I also used the green address option. http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/04/thoughts-from-someone-who-assumed-bitcoin-was-a-machine-that-coverts-loose-change-to-bills This was your fault. Thank you, everyone knows how bearish I am but the OP is based solely on fact. Why protect us from being able to buy cheap coins? Strange...I too have 11 million BTCs. Yes, please sell.Perhaps invest in a nice set of Justin Bieber tickets. Except for the fact that the huge drops in price are always combined with huge MtGox lag.Unfortunately they will be fixing this today (tomorrow there) and I cannot write my trade bot to take advantage of it. Good, now if all of the articles say that the Bitcoin bubble popped, their future articles talking about a bubble will be even more silly. That is why the price is still so low.The average person is not going to put their money into it until it is super easy. Why do you want to buy Federal Reserve Notes? Have you heard something we have not?Is there a new Federal Reserve Note app coming out? Something new in the works for the FRN market?Let us in on the news. There is no psychological barrier between the current price and $266. Let me check my wallet...yep, same amount therelag did not cost me anything Just buying Federal Reserve Notes to hoard is just greedy and hurts the Federal Reserve's economy.Merchants are going to stop accepting them because nobody is spending and it will all collapse.All thanks to the hoarders. The FDIC already moved forward with this in the US and UK.A joint paper by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England dated December 10, 2012, shows that these plans have been long in the making; that they originated with the G20 Financial Stability Board in Basel, Switzerland (discussed earlier here); and that the result will be to deliver clear title to the banks of depositor funds. http://www.webofdebt.com/articles/big_brother_basel.php There is no bull or bear. Only Bitcoin or fiat.Make your choice.
There is no need to act as a community.Sell if you want, buy if you want.Unfortunately I have to pay for my hosting service this month, hopefully the price goes up a bit more so I do not have to spend as many BTC.Either way, it is better than owning fiat. Too bad it takes 3 days to transfer money from my bank account to MtGox.Otherwise I would file an extension on my taxes and use the money put aside to buy some cheap coins.Do this again in two weeks when my next paycheck gets transferred over. Grow some.Welcome to Bitcoin, hold on to your seats. Unease of holding Federal Reserve Notes that are backed only by a bunch of bankers?Nope. Right, it is only if you are intending to make money on the trade of currencies.For me, I am simply moving out of the dollar. The FinCEN even states that everything kicks in when you come back into the arms of the dollar.Federal Reserve Notes belong in the Federal Reserve. They can keep them. You can already do this on bitfinex Have fun with your dollars. Some cheap coins up for the taking if you can get in there. I guess you missed the point of the question on the Bitcoins forum.How is buying something with Bitcoins which have increased in value different from buying something with Euros after going up in value?I keep hearing about capital gains for spending your currency but have never heard of this when it comes to other currencies. It is the Gox lag. Price falls more the longer the lag time.When the lag clears up the price jumps up.I would write a trading bot to trade based upon lag time but they will be clearing that up in a day or so. Not my store, I just like the concept.If you go to Europe and exchange your dollars for Euros and the price of Euros goes up, you do not have to pay Capital gains tax on the products you buy with your Euro.The only Bitcoins I own are the ones bought with taxed $$. Interesting, I do not see why they would not do it. All they do is take your order and pay cash for whatever you purchase. It appears to have gone under the radar but, http://www.bitspend.net allows you to purchase anything on the Internet using Bitcoins.So...if you ever plan on buying anything on the Internet in the future, you may as well keep your BTC instead of losing a chunk of it in taxes. How does one predict the trend of some millionaire in China picking up a newspaper and reading about Bitcoin for the first time and having it "click"?Same thing in any other part of the world.There is nothing to predict when someone with a lot of money may start moving money today or wait until returning from a business trip next week. I believe we are getting an inside peek at the mindset of the "weak hands". I guess I could declare it. Or just give it away. Either way.So, what if I went to a store in the United States that took Euros and purchased the watch there? Same amount as in Europe.And what if it was a really nice $10,000 watch? I have a software program tracking proudon. If he ever turns into a bull I have it set to sell everything and then short Bitcoin, taking a loan out on my house to short on every exchange that allows it. Say I am going on a trip to Europe. I convert $1,000 to 800 Euros (assume 1.25Euro/dollar).A week into my trip the price of Euros jumps against the dollar. Euro jumps from 1.25/dollar to 2.50/dollar.I go to the store and purchase a watch that in the United States costs $1,000 but I only pay 400 Euro. I also spend the rest of my Euro on some great meals and entertainment.Do I need to pay Capital gains tax on the rise in value of the Euro vs the dollar ($1,000)? With the increased usage of the word "bubble" in Keynesian media stories and bear posts we are reaching the point of full saturation of bubble posts and articles.Some articles are even increasing the usage of the word "bubble" within the article to increase its usage. If this trend continues, every Kenesian news story and bear post will consist of well over 90% using just the word "bubble".It is my theory that by the time this reaches 100%, there will be no room left for the word "Bitcoin". Even the most hard core liberal will not be able to read a news story consisting only of the word "bubble" and will not be willing to read it. Governments will prop up the news articles with bail outs but it will be at that point that the bubble bubble will burst and the news stories will go back to only 90% bubble talk.I have done much research on this and even include a chart:      ^     /   \_^__  90%    /   /_/ Ahh, here is an example:
I do not know charts very well but looking at the current price pattern I would say that it is one of those converging triangle things where once the lines meet anything can happen...I am sure someone else can probably explain it better. My buddy just signed up for a MtGox account. He was put in the queue just to get a verified account. This is not a bubble.But even if it were. We would only lose a couple of days from the price.I believe the bubble talk is in a bubble though. The amount of times the word bubble is mentioned cannot be maintained. I believe all of us here at Bitcoin would agree that if the Federal Reserve were to pump Bitcoin up to $1 trillion per bitcoin, we would all be very pissed and stop doing Bitcoin stuff.Hopefully nobody from the Fed is on here right now spying and finding out our secret weakness. They would be hailed heros when they implement their plan and destroy Bitcoin.I hope that never happens. Individual. Such as?Btw. I have a lot of people on ignore. For the previous bubble the price skyrocketted from around $20 to $32 then ALL the way back down to $17.So basically, those saying that the Bitcoin bubble is going to pop are saying that it will almost double, then go back down to less than half.That would be like the price falling all the way to what it was a few days ago.Scary stuff. To just pay for the work it would probably be between 50 and 100 BTC.To do it as an X prize type of incentive, multiply that by 2 to 5.But you would have to solve the problem of fiat not being p2p. $200.90 all time high...those were the days Fiat currencies are worth less. My theory is that they add a '0' at the end of the queue.Have you ever seen a number without a zero at the end? I believe at some point, the difficulty of going back to dollars will be more hassle than it is worth.The tax implications alone would make my head spin. Best to just stick with one currency from now on. I already pay taxes on the dollars in my paycheck, no need to pay taxes again when I trade currencies into the Federal Reserve's domain. $1,000 for one Bitcoin does not pay off my mortgage. Ever used the Internet?Like that.With less laws. Platinum is being durable, amalgamable, malleable, divisible, homogeneous, rare, easily recognizable...Silver is being durable, amalgamable, malleable, divisible, homogeneous, rare, easily recognizable...Copper is being durable, amalgamable, malleable, divisible, homogeneous, rare, easily recognizable... "While gold is designed so that it cannot be hyperinflated in name, it certainly can be hyperinflated in substance. Already, there are numerous knockoffs such as platinum, silver, and copper in place." Your only risk is that the site owner disappears with your money.But when I checked there was over $600k being lent out. It appears that the site is making money so more than likely the long term gains of having a good company that makes money is better than stealing everyone's money then trying to hide out from the legal ramifications. We always knew that the price would have to go up to meet the demand.And there are plenty of huge projects that will make Bitcoin worth much more than the current price.May as well get in now before those projects are released than wait for the announcements. True capitalism creates a productive society based upon the knowledge that greed is a human trait.Other social structures try to exist by suppressing greed.Sort of like religions trying to suppress other human traits  to fit their own social structure.I prefer to allow my own humanity to thrive. I used to live in the USA. My home right now is in Afghanistan. Who knows where my home will be next year. Not likely in the USA.A world currency is perfect for me.
Bump for great work!Thank You! I was able to get on their page when I went home last night.It appears that they are planning on offering monthly fees. I believe it was $5 for a month's worth of purchases up to $350, $8 for up to $1,500 and another one above that.I would consider doing $5/month for that. I could cover all of my online purchases for most months and only us Bitcoins from here on out.Getting closer and closer to no more need for dollars at all. Loaning dollars. He is still a bit timid on buying BTC since he was all ready to do so at $93 and Coinbase only allowed him to buy 1 BTC when he wanted to buy 10. No option for buying dollars with 1 bitcoin at $160,000 to pay off my mortgage.The rest is my currency, why would I get rid of it? Perhaps it is the uncertainty of how smoothly the transfer will go.Remember, MtGox drops $30 in a few minutes based on a bit of lag. If the transfer caused a few hour/days crash...good bye rally. I live in Bitcoin land. The land where I have access to the Internet and can buy anything on the Internet with bitcoins (http://www.bitspend.net). OP, looks like the red line was a glitch.Refresh. Let us say that you moved from the US to Mexico and in the process converted all of your dollars to pesos.Now, let us say that for some reason the peso started rising against the dollar quickly. All of the sudden your pesos are able to buy more than you were able to previously and the dollar is losing value.Do you now convert all of your pesos to dollars? Or do you just keep your pesos and use them as currency? My buddy is getting 1500% return loaning money on Bitfinex for margin trading. Let us say that you moved from the US to Mexico and in the process converted all of your dollars to Pesos.Now, let us say that for some reason the Peso started rising against the dollar quickly. All of the sudden your Pesos are able to buy more than you were able to previously and the dollar is losing value.Do you now convert all of your Pesos to dollars? Or do you just keep your Pesos and use them as currency? I have done well to just take the money you have and buy at whatever price it is at that moment.I was asking the same questions as you when the price was around $47 (I was hoping it would dip into the $30s just one more time before buying). Fortunately someone said to just go ahead and buy.The next day it shot up over $50 and is still going.And do not look at it like you are investing in Bitcoin.You are shifting into a new currency. Like you just moved to Mexico and will be using the Peso from now on. Hard coded in one of the clients. The minimum fee for the new client is .0001That is less than 2 cents. I see the word "greedy" thrown around almost everywhere lately, but now bitcoin is getting greedy? I was just reading a review:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1a8idx/i_bought_groceries_with_bitcoin_a_bitspend_review/ Actually the cost is only $2 for up to $50. I am charged more than that for paying my electric bill online.At the rate Bitcoin is rising, the 4% charge would have been eaten up in a few hours of holding bitcoins instead of dollars. (if you had bought $50 worth of bitcoins at $184 6 hours ago and then bought something through bitspend at the current price $192, the fee would be moot). But it is more likely that you would have your dollars in bitcoins much longer than a couple of hours. And the largest Bitcoin wallet has surpassed the M1 of Anguilla.Not a bad thing to hold on a USB. You may as well ask if people who use dollars plan on cashing out to Yens or Rubles once they reach 1M. Thank you, I have been looking for this site since the first time I saw it. Got it, thanks.
The dollar's future:Thanks partially to this: Bitcoin's rocket engines are blowing out huge balls of fire. Is it possible to have two paired keys such that I encrypt a message with one key, then later decrypt that same message with a different key?I basically am looking to encrypt a message on a server, the server then releases the encrypted message. Then later, the key to decrypt the message will be released.But I am just trying to play it safe as far as storing or transferring the key used to encrypt the message in the first place. I would rather just immediately discard it once the message is created and hold the second key in cold storage until it is time to release it.Any thoughts? The increase in value is EXACTLY why I do not ever buy a computer knowing I could buy a faster computer at a lower price a month down the road.I am still kicking myself for paying $3,000 for a 66MHz computer back in 1995.If only I had kept that investment I would have a much faster machine today.Everyone else believes the same thing since nobody ever buys computers. No, I am reserving 1 bitcoin for my mortgage.Actually, I believe that calls for a vanity address  Bots. I remember 100k BTC walls when we were around $5. Most of the Google Searches for Bitcoin Are Coming From Russiahttp://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/13/04/3479048/most-of-the-google-searches-for-bitcoin-are-coming-from-russiaRussians most interested in Bitcoin, searches showhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9976524/Russians-most-interested-in-Bitcoin-searches-show.htmlOf the top searches for Bitcoin from Russia:February 28: 16%March 31: 41%April 2: 100% It sucks that the decentralized Internet only has one search engine: Yahoo.--Internet user (1994) Perhaps the shortened version is easier:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYJtHd28BXU   Or is it the love of bitcoin thats the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love Bitcoin is to know and love the fact that Bitcoin is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a millibit, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of Bitcoin and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of Bitcoin are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.Let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters: the man who damns Bitcoin has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.Run for your life from any man who tells you that Bitcoin is evil. That sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one anothertheir only substitute, if they abandon Bitcoin, is the muzzle of a gun.But Bitcoin demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their Bitcoin and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being richwill not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guiltand of his life, as he deserves.Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standardthe men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted Bitcointhe men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-lawmen who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victimsthen Bitcoin becomes its creators avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once theyve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the hacker. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the barometer of a societys virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsionwhen you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothingwhen you see that Bitcoin is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favorswhen you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws dont protect you against them, but protect them against youwhen you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrificeyou may know that your society is doomed. Bitcoin is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying Bitcoin, for Bitcoin is mens protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers deny Bitcoin and only allow a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Bitcoin has an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, Account overdrawn.'When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, Who is destroying the world?' You are.You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why its crumbling around you, while youre damning its life-bloodBitcoin. You look upon Bitcoin as the savages did with gold before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout mens history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the love of money being evil, which you repeat with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slavesslaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebodys mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepersas industrialists.To the glory of mankind, there was, for a brief time in history, a country of moneyand I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to early America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, mans mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human beingthe self-made manthe American industrialist.If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choosebecause it contains all the othersthe fact that they were the people who created the phrase to make money. No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantityto be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words to make money hold the essence of human morality.Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters continents. Now the looters credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the bitcoin and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide as, I think, he will.Until and unless you discover that Bitcoin is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When Bitcoin ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns....or bitcoins. Take your choicethere is no otherand your time is running out.--slight changes made to "Francisco's Money Speech" from Atlas Shrugged. So you think that Bitcoin is the root of all evil?Have you ever asked what is the root of Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a tool of exchange, which cant exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Bitcoin is the virtual shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Bitcoin is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Bitcoin is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?When you accept bitcoins in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to bitcoin. Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those bitcoins in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those bitcoins, are a token of honoryour claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of Bitcoin, Is this what you consider evil?Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motionsand youll learn that mans mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.Or do you say that bitcoin is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of mans capacity to think. Then is bitcoin made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is bitcoin made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Bitcoin is madebefore it can be looted or moochedmade by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he cant consume more than he has produced.To trade by means of bitcoin is the code of the men of good will. Bitcoin rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Bitcoin allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Bitcoin permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Bitcoin permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Bitcoin demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their lossthe recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your miserythat you must offer them values, not woundsthat the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Bitcoin demands that you sell, not your weakness to mens stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your bitcoin can find. And when men live by tradewith reason, not force, as their final arbiterit is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest abilityand the degree of a mans productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is Bitcoin. Is this what you consider evil?But bitcoin is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. Bitcoin is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causalitythe men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind.Bitcoin will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: bitcoin will not give him a code of values, if hes evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if hes evaded the choice of what to seek. Bitcoin will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his bitcoin replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his bitcoin. Is this the reason why you call it evil?Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealththe man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his bitcoin, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that bitcoin corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his bitcoin? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Bitcoin is a living power that dies without its root. Bitcoin will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil?Bitcoin is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your bitcoin by fraud? By pandering to mens vices or mens stupidity? By catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your bitcoin will not give you a moments or a satoshis worth of joy. Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then youll scream that bitcoin is evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of bitcoin?Bitcoin will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Bitcoin is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Bitcoin will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of bitcoin? Yet again, the reason there are rich people and poor people persists. It is all by choice.The poor choose poverty over the unthinkable, "greed". I have not heard of this...I like this concept. I cannot access their page at work, is this something you can sign up for on their website? You are lucky you got out when you did so you did not have to live through the crash from $195 to $175 (and back up to $188). A wise man that OP... I have not bought a computer since 1995 when I paid $3,000 for a 66MHz speed machine.I will wait until the price of computers gets more stable so I do not kick myself for not waiting to buy a faster machine at a lower price. I am thinking that the day that Bitcoins are worth $160,000/BTC the price of bread will likely be over $100/loaf.I do not see that scenario as being too far into the future.I am glad my home loan is in dollars. The U.S. debt nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013, from $5.9 trillion to $15 trillion. This increases the chance the U.S. will let the dollar's value slide, allowing it to repay the debt with cheaper money.Altogether, foreign countries own $5 trillion in U.S. debt  (as of December 2011). If China, Japan or other major holders started dumping these holdings of Treasury notes on the secondary market, this could cause a panic leading to collapse.A sudden dollar collapse would create global economic turmoil  as investors rush to other currencies, such as bitcoin, or other assets, gold or other commodities. Demand for Treasuries would plummet, driving up interest rates. Import prices would skyrocket, causing inflation. U.S. exports would be dirt cheap, boosting the economy briefly. Unfortunately, uncertainty, inflation and high interest rates would strangle possible business growth. Unemployment would worsen, sending the U.S. back into recession or even creating a depression. The only way the dollar can hold its value is because it is considered the world's "reserve currency" thanks to oil and other things are traded in dollars. But that is changing.BRICS members China and Brazil agreed on Tuesday to trade in their own currencies  the equivalent of up to $30 billion per year, moving to take almost half of their trade exchanges out of the U.S. dollar zone. Taiwan and Singapore  have both become offshore trading centres with direct clearing in renminbi, while Brazil has established a currency swap agreement with the mainland. The UK is expected to follow suit  soon with its own swap facility. Ok, so maybe you do not believe the dollar will collapse. Where do you keep your dollars? Hopefully not in a bank.Confiscating the customer deposits in Cyprus banks, it seems, was not a one-off, desperate idea of a few Eurozone troika officials scrambling to salvage their balance sheets. A joint paper by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England dated December 10, 2012, shows that these plans have been long in the making; that they originated with the G20 Financial Stability Board in Basel, Switzerland; and that the result will be to deliver clear title to the banks of depositor funds.New Zealand has a similar directive, indicating that this isnt just an emergency measure for troubled Eurozone countries. New Zealands Voxy reported on March 19th: The National Government pushing a Cyprus-style solution to bank failure in New Zealand which will see small depositors lose some of their savings to fund big bank bailouts . . . . Open Bank Resolution (OBR) is Finance Minister Bill Englishs favoured option dealing with a major bank failure. If a bank fails under OBR, all depositors will have their savings reduced overnight to fund the banks bail out.Although few depositors realize it, legally the bank owns the depositors funds  as soon as they are put in the bank.  Your deposits are about to become stock investments:"An efficient path for returning the sound operations of the G-SIFI to the private sector would be provided by exchanging or converting a sufficient amount of the unsecured debt from the original creditors of the failed company [meaning the depositors] into equity [or stock]. In the U.S., the new equity would become capital in one or more newly formed operating entities. In the U.K., the same approach could be used, or the equity could be used to recapitalize the failing financial company itselfthus, the highest layer of surviving bailed-in creditors would become the owners of the resolved firm. In either country, the new equity holders would take on the corresponding risk of being shareholders in a financial institution."No exception is indicated for insured deposits in the U.S., meaning those under $250,000, the deposits we thought were protected by FDIC insurance. This can hardly be an oversight, since it is the FDIC that is issuing the directive.tl;dr The dollar bubble is nearing its end. It is about to collapse and even if it does not, the government does not plan to bail out banks so instead banks are considering your deposits as collateral to their stock purchases (in highly risky stocks).
Use Bitcoin as a currency. Dump your old currency and use the best one.While you use that new currency, it may gain in value quickly or slowly.Either way, trusting fiat right now is risky. I believe they have several times back when the price was dropping to $2 and everyone was giving up on it.Something like...as long as someone is willing to mine bitcoins, it will keep going. If you still have fiat currency, you have an opportunity to stop using that ancient form of spending and come to a useful currency. Bitcoin is proving Paul Krugman wrong.And what is this "sell" that you speak of? Is there a central location that explains the steps it takes to convert your dollars to bitcoins for the different exchanges?That would be helpful. Fixed it for you. I will sell 1 bitcoin.I will buy dollars with a single bitcoin when I am able to pay off my $160,000 mortgage with the proceeds from that sale.That will be the last time I buy dollars with my Bitcoin currency.All of the rest will be spent or held. I did this way back when it was under $10 and we had a big swing up one day.Had 100 for sale at 100...unfortunately that one kicked in before I could take it out (I did not have 100 in my account).I have one for selling 100 at 5000, one at 10,000, and a few others up there.So sure, drive that price up  Which helps in spending because Bitcoin is inflationary. Which helps the Bitcoin economy because people will be more likely to spend their bitcoins because the value of a bitcoin keeps going down.And according to Krugman that is good because more people will spend and that helps the economy.So miners are not only helping to secure the network, they are stimulating the Bitcoin economy.So much for anyone hoarding. Here comes the Gox lag... Which could actually end up costing less than transaction fees at an exchange. And at the current price, the cost of mining is miniscule compared to what you get in return. (currently a 64% profit margin, not including the rising price after you have mined). So...it would be better for the Bitcoin economy if miners hoard their coins...in order to avoid this requirement for an inflow of capital. Correct? Or being used as currency. Spent on bitcoin purchases for goods or services. Newly mined bitcoins. Nice, thanks. Correct, and because it does not flow through MtGox, the price is not affected. Hmm, I am only able to see down to 167 on there, is there a setting to widen the chart? I am not sure of the exact price as I cannot view all of the charts at work but I would guestimate that selling 3600 BTC right now on MtGox would bring the price down near $100/BTC.Has there been any  indication on MtGox that all miners are selling 3600 bitcoins per day?Or are miners different from other users that would somehow imply that they are not like the rest of the Bitcoin community where only .6% trade on a daily basis. You claim that because X bitcoins are created, Y dollars need to be invested for those X bitcoins to stay in the system.I am asking if 3000X bitcoins require 3000Y dollars to be invested for those 3000X bitcoins to stay in the system.X being 3600 and Y being $.5 million.3000X being ~11 million and 3000Y being $2 billion The point is...why do you still have fiat?
Of all of the risk I would never consider the software doing what it is supposed to do.The biggest risk is the couple month old site closing up shop and taking everyone's money. They are being spent. Please point to the facts that would show that bitcoins are not being spent.Speculation is not the only forum on this board. Go read through MarketPlace or Project Development. You saying that miners cashing out 3600 per day equals $.5 million per day. That would be the same as saying we are propping up Bitcoin by keeping $2 billion in the system. Has $2 billion been poured into buying bitcoins to reach this price?If 100,000 miners have an extra $14 added to their electricity cost, it will not impact the bitcoin price. What will affect the price is when those 100,000 miners convert their dollars to bitcoins in order to buy an 88 BTC ASIC (which are paid for in BTC).To say that they would have spent that $14 on MtGox instead of electricity is a stretch. That is like saying that federal income taxes are keeping the price of bitcoins down by $2 trillion per year because people are paying taxes instead of buying bitcoins. Woo Hoo Barbados!I spent a day there, very beautiful country. The tour guide took me by Tiger Woods' house.Rhianna grew up there and she is the Ambassador for Culture and Youth in Barbados. I have a buddy who was trying to buy at $93 and Coinbase only allowed him to buy 1BTC.He feels like he missed the boat so he is planning on moving money to BitFinex to loan.He is frustrated with the difficulty of trying to get his dollars to any of these places. 37 cents away Do you truly believe that if all Bitcoin users were to go onto MtGox right now and sell all 11 million bitcoins, they would walk away with a combined $2 billion?  That is the only way your $.5 million per day thing works.Is that the current ask total these days? $2 billion?I plan on buying an ASIC. To do so I will need to convert dollars to bitcoins. I will purchase my ASIC and run the ASIC to get bitcoins. I will then use those bitcoins as currency or hold them. Any electricity costs I accumulate will be paid with dollars like any other utility bill (until they take bitcoins). What part of that process requires me to cash out my bitcoins? I plan on getting all 21 million. http://blockchain.info/statsHash Rate and Electricity ConsumptionDifficulty7,672,999.92Hash Rate62,554.01 GH/sElectricity Consumption *975.84 megawatt hoursElectricity Cost$146,376.39 Just over a week later and we are right around the corner ($181) from having the market cap of a mid-cap  company.Definition of 'Mid Cap' A company with a market capitalization between $2 and $10 billion, which is calculated by multiplying the number of a company''''s shares outstanding by its stock price. Mid cap is an abbreviation for the term "middle capitalization".http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midcapstock.asp It is called opportunity.BitPay saw that the masses of merchants would not understand the bitcoin client and how to create a new address for each customer, etc.So they created a service to allow a merchant to just throw a button on their website which allows them to "magically" accept Bitcoin that could then be easily transferred to their bank account in dollars.Anything that makes Bitcoin more friendly to Joe Six Pack will make the service provider money. Going so fast...knowledge of countries coming too quickly... Saying that $.5 million is paid per day follows the same mistake that people who think we actually have over $1.5 billion worth of bitcoins make.The money traded on the exchange is what determines cost. Out of almost 11 million bitcoins in existence, around 75,000 are traded daily or about .6% of all bitcoins determine the price.Trying to say that the 3600 bitcoins created daily is part of that 75000 as opposed to that 10+ million is misleading.Taking the trend of the Bitcoin economy as a whole, only about $3,500 of mined bitcoins need to be sucked up by buyers each day to simply maintain the current price.As for miners needing to pay their own bills. Most people who hold bitcoins need to pay their bills. Most people who hold bitcoins are paid in cash. Bills can easily be paid without going through the extra steps of converting bitcoins to do so. When Google was paying their CEOs in the early days with stock options, were they bringing in the amount of money per day to pay for those stock options in order to hold value?The inflation created by mining is already priced in.  What currency should  we spend on goods and services then?Follow up:Why would anyone be silly  enough to have dollars to spend right now? It would only be the people involved buying, not the company itself.I believe Bitcoin is not yet ready for prime time when it comes to big businesses holding bitcoins.No current software or services for handling private keys within departments (this year's budget mysteriously disappears from the accounting department). Though we are getting there. I give bitcoins to my neices and nephews but I still hold the private keys.Mainly so that if they ever want to spend it, they can...but if they forget about it or lose their keys I can help them out down the road.I gave my nephew one bitcoin back when it was worth $45...I wonder if he is keeping track of the price. Not a bad present.I gave him a single stock of McDonalds about 10 years ago worth $45. That stock is now worth around $98. Anyone can "take profits" by buying something with their Bitcoin (a new ASIC miner perhaps?).I take profits every month by spending less on my hosting service (paid in bitcoins) than the previous month.I am moving from hoarding dollars to holding a currency of value. Should we also compare against the amount of currency for these countries in 10 years? I am configuring all equations and handling of my website to deal in mBTC to the user.
Quickly after Eritrea will be: So it appears that the impression is that hoarders are hurting Bitcoin because we are not using it as its intended purpose, as a currency.I imagine that such an idea must be from people new to Bitcoin because we have come a long long way since only being able to use bitcoins as a currency to buy pizza or alpaca socks.My wife's clothing store was one of BitPay's first merchants, there were 3 of us on their merchant page. Now there are over 50,000 and growing.  Yep, they take BTC via BitPay. Or you can just order a vehicle online if you are not in the Kansas area:http://www.overlandparkjeepdodge.net/index.htm Is this based upon opinion or do you have facts to back up that claim?http://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-excluding-popularhttp://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitpay-processes-5-million-in-march-eclipses-silk-road/I have not used bitcoins as a currency until recent months. If I cared if someone saw my transactions I would just take steps to make them anonymous.At the moment I do not care, just as must as I am willing to put my real name out on the Internet via facebook and other sites.But if I wanted to have a private transaction (bitcoin cams or silk road etc.) I would want the ability to have some anonymity in those transactions and thus maybe buy bitcoins locally or run my coins through an anonymizing service or whichever.Just as I would start creating fake names on the Internet or block access to my identity on various websites as that information starts to get used for darker purposes (ie. government/corporate/criminal tracking). Why are people so worried about people "hoarding" bitcoins?Is it because you think that there will be no more bitcoins left to spend?Is it because you think we should all be spending all of our money?Is it the 1% thing?Do you think it is a huge conspiracy to later crash the price and destroy Bitcoin?There are almost 11 million bitcoins out there. Even if there were only 100 bitcoins (less than created in the last hour), those 100 bitcoins could be used to run a small economy with the fact that each bitcoin is 100,000,000 satoshi. And if you are so worried about that, gather up at least 100 bitcoins for that purpose.If you are worried about us not spending bitcoins, the more money that goes into the bitcoin economy, the larger the bitcoin market will be and the more incentive for someone to tap that huge market. How many technology pitches start with "X is a billion dollar a year industry...". Look at the video game market, millions are spent to get kids to come off of a few bucks to buy some game or another. Competing companies vying for the larger piece of the pie. People will spend their bitcoin. And if it turns us all into savers instead of spenders, then all the better. How much is consumer debt these days?The 1% thing? Are you worried that only a few people will have control over the whole Bitcoin economy and be able to control things like the huge corporations and banks do now? The best way to prevent that is to start hoarding yourself and get as many other people to hoard as well.Or is it all about crashing Bitcoin? The old pump and dump argument. Is everyone working together on this? Because I never got the memo. Bitcoin has hardly scratched the surface of adoption. If someone wants to dump their bitcoin, there are tons of people in line to buy at cheaper prices daily. Let them dump into our waiting wallets. In some ways, Bitcoin is less anonymous than the dollar.All of your transactions are right there for the world to see.And you mention Amazon, PayPal, etc. for the non-anonymity of the dollar.I see your third party services and return with BitMit, bitcoin-otc, bitcointalk.You can look at the address in my signature and see exactly where I have received and spent bitcoins. Can you do that with your dollars? End the Fed? Bitcoin may actually be the solution to people only buying what they need instead of just throwing their money away on random crap. I recall that I originally posted this because it had gone from $7 to $12 quickly (a 70% increase). Then settled back down to $10.Then after that all hell broke loose and it was every man for himself trying to pick away at any gains they could muster.A similar increase today would push the price up to $270 and back down to $225. It would be pure chaos. I would say that someone photoshopped those black arrows. I do not think it is part of the original chart.Good enough explanation? Parties and laws will be things that people with dollars worry about. The dollar is reaching the tipping point of its bubble.Best to get rid of them while you still can. In this article:http://rt.com/op-edge/patent-lawsuit-bitcoin-exchanges-458/It is mentioned:"in the 1990s I developed a technology and market for creating price-discovery for future box office results for movies. The entrenched monopoly in Hollywood made sure that never succeeded; breaking up the company and selling the technology to Wall St. where it is warehoused out of reach of any good it might have done establishing freer markets benefiting the public's interest."Perhaps this is something that Bitcoin can facilitate. I like how people speak of greed as if it is a bad thing.The more people who put their money into Bitcoin, the more people will start to understand Bitcoin and be willing to use their bitcoins to spend.Why would you go back to dollars once you understand how Bitcoin works? +1http://www.bittronic.comGood service with good prices. I believe they have Bitcoin-bongs for sale on Silk Road. It does have intrinsic value outside of just a currency.Coming soon. Apparently the SEC is working to have him arrested.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=159772.0His address and all of his information has been posted on the boards here as well.
Why would they have dollars in the first place if bitcoins continue to increase in value? Why have a currency that loses value? The dude is a hardcore socialist/communist. Even has the hammer and sickle tattooed on his arm. He is all about redistribution and all of that.I am not saying it is right, but at least he is helping to collapse a broken system. I have a buddy who one day just said "screw it". Instead of paying his rent that month, he took it and put it toward a cheap $800 van. He took out the back seats and made a bed out of them with storage underneath. He added a couple of solar panels on the roof and powers all of his interior stuff with that (laptop, small TV, phone, etc.).He just drives the van to state parks and goes deep into the woods and just camps out for a few weeks at a time. His wife gets disability from the military for around $1500 a month and they get food stamps so he is doing fine, his only bill is insurance on the van and his cell phone bill.He will come by the neighborhood and he has enough friends that they usually let him just park his van at their place or he finds an empty lot nearby.He said that when he travels he will either stay at Walmart parking lots or just parked on the street, blending in with all of the other vehicles.He heads north in the summer and goes south in the winter. He will do odd jobs here and there to keep himself busy and make a bit of pocket change but he has all the free time he could ever want. He is always working on some new invention with electricity or some little device. He has the time to do it.I have considered it. But for me, I was considering buying something like this:http://www.sportsmobile.com/2_eb-110s.htmlI would do it if I could just have a business online. Everyone agrees at that point to add a couple of decimal points.Though, I suspect that if BTC does reach $1 million it will coincide with bread costing $1,000. It is over...I will pay $50 a piece. Is there not some sort of exclusion for something that has been known by the public for a certain amount of time?I know when I was going to file a patent, one of the regulations was that I could not patent something that I had publicly disclosed more than a year prior. Have you seen the complaints about fees being too large?If people hoard, that means the price will go up. As the price goes up the fees gain in value. As the fees gain in value, more people will mine.Also, you are talking about 2140. We have to first deal with the problem of transaction time between Earth and Mars. I believe you meant Bitcoin(tm) trademark registered... For that to happen, more than likely the dollar will have met us somewhere in the middle by crashing.I would never cash out...I would just have more buying power with my bitcoins. Bitcoin:You have two cows that create milk at 60kmL/day.You mine the milk and hoard it while talking up how great milk is.The price of milk skyrockets and you stockpile more and more.On paper you are the richest farmer in your village.To be continued...  Yes, it will be a requirement by...umm...hmm... People think of the price based upon the total amount of bitcoins in existence (almost 11 million).The price does not go up a dollar after $11 million goes from dollars to bitcoins.MtGox trades around 75,000 bitcoins per day.It is those 75,000 bitcoins that set the price for the rest of the millions of bitcoins being used or hoarded daily.So, if on average, $75,000 moves into the bitcoin economy per day the price will go up by $1 per day.Just a few weeks ago we saw someone buy 20,000 bitcoins at once. The price was either $60 or $75. That is over a million dollars. $1 million divided by 75,000 is just over $13. Seeing the price go up by $13 is not uncommon.Of course, some of those 75,000 bitcoin trades are people selling. This means that for the price to go up a dollar there are $75,000 more in buys than sells.So, in order for the price of bitcoins to go from $140 to $1000/BTC, there would have to be about $65 million more buys than sells. If $7 million comes into bitcoin per month we will be at $1,000 by the end of the year.I think we can all fathom many ways in which that much money will be invested monthly. I was not saying that people would not use bitcoins for spending, but they would use it at the last moment. And will be less likely to spend months early in order to save a little.It is just something to think about. Hotel and travel agencies that like to have things booked months in advance may have to give better incentives if they are paid in bitcoins. We have seen this affect with people pre-ordering mining rigs paying with hundreds of bitcoins last year that are worth a whole lot more now. Graphs are great for proving what happened.I have a graph of what has happened for the past 3 months:     /    /     /^Now take that graph and throw it away.The price will either do this:_/or this:_  \Or should I have better graphs to make it more believable? Ok, so somewhere between $320 and $1.1 million. Can we hold you to that prediction? Stability fuels the rocket. So, when is Google's stock going to crash? They have been going up for several years.Just a warning to those doing any speculation, I plan on selling about 100 BTC when the price reaches $5,000/BTC. Plan accordingly. There is an ebb and flow within the media. Once a story comes out, if there is positive attention paid to something, the opposite will be true within days. Same if something negative comes out, a few days later there will be articles about the other side of the story. Ever followed politics?For every story the media gets two stories out of it this way. It was mentioned here that Cyprus is a very poor nation and that we would not see a whole lot of activity from the people of Cyprus as most of them do not even have Internet connections.On the other hand markets shift on the slightest indicators. Cyprus is an indicator of what governments are willing to do during this financial crisis. Ben Bernanke could be overheard at dinner saying "stimulate" and the DJIA could jump 200 the next day.Markets tend to try to beat the actual affects. A huge multi-million barrel oil field is discovered and the price of oil goes down. Even though not one drop of oil has yet to be pumped. I predict the price at $2,346 at some point that day.
This just further highlights the fact that people will want to pay for things later with bitcoins.And with a deflationary currency, the value over time will trend upwards.Now all of this may become less of a factor when everyone is using bitcoins and they only gain value of 2% or so per year. But we are not there yet. I am looking for some freelance work setting up some ExtJS pages.The content will be very complicated so I am not looking for people who are "willing to learn". What are they spending then? Hmm, it is a few years Did anything ever come of trying to start a credit union? I know that so many of the uninformed like to claim that nobody will spend bitcoins because "why spend when the value will go up".However ignorant that is, I am noticing that I need to adjust my spending when using bitcoins as opposed to dollars.I have been paid up on my mortgage for a couple of months now, same with my credit cards. I paid them early out of habit of "I have the money, I need to pay it anyway, so I might as well pay it now".But I pay for my web hosting service with bitcoins. I got my invoice for this month which is due next week and my first instinct was to go ahead and pay it and get it out of my way. Then I realized, a week from now my bitcoins could be worth a lot more.So the best strategy there is to pay it at the last possible moment.And then there are things like travel or things you may book months in advance to get a better price. Why would I pay for a vacation this summer hoping to get a 10% discount when, if I wait until this summer, my money could be worth a lot more than the 10% savings.It may be something we need to get used to and change our habits both as consumers and providers.Now I am sure that there will be ignorant people shouting "see! that's why Bitcoin won't work, nobody will spend their money!".That is not what I am saying at all. The alternative for these cases would be me holding cash and not gaining any wealth over time. I am talking about maximizing my spending power by holding off on spending while building wealth. But still spending nonetheless. Ahh, yep. I just divided then moved the decimal not taking into account the original value. The ratio is the same for the $212 estimate though.My hosting service adjusts the cost in BTC based on the dollar cost. Check out Bitronic.I pay $66/month for a dedicated server. Last month that was 1.4 BTC, this month it will be less than 1 BTC. I have been moving away from fiat and pay for anything I can with bitcoins.I am in a unique situation to almost completely switch over to using bitcoins for all purposes. I work on a military base in Afghanistan. That means all of my meals are taken care of and I have no bills nor living expenses.I sold off everything back home and only have a monthly payment for a storage unit and mortgage on my house (which is up for rent so the rent will take care of that).Every now and then I want things for out here, I always look first for Bitcoin websites. That is why I believe we desperately need a bitcoin site product search website.I hope that by the time I return home I will not need fiat anymore  as things progress. That site mentions that a nickname for the microBitcoin would be "Mickey"...maybe Mickey and Milli will be future children's names based upon Bitcoin.  In the near future we will likely be talking about bitcoins using the mBTC valuation for common items.What should the naming convention be when speaking of milli-bitcoins(hyphen?)?What about symbol? m฿? Ya, I dropped $200 in the casino a few months ago. Lost it all playing blackjack. I usually do pretty well.I also lost $1200 worth of Bitcoins a few days ago by selling at $99 and buying back at $120.That will teach me not to sell. Ever. Is that single digits in mBTC? Bitcoin increased 1473% in one year!$.30 to $4.72....in 2011 (1473%)$4.72 to $13.50...in 2012 (186%)So far in 2013:$13.50 to $130 (863%)For a 1473% jump for the year the price would need to reach:$212.35We are only slightly ahead of our 2011 pace. Then again, Bitcoin is becoming much more popular and the world is a lot less stable. I believe I can speak for all Bitcoin users in saying that we will abide by all government rules and regulations and will be paying all of our highly justifiable taxes to the kings of our era who so mercilessly allow us to bath in the glory of their great countries.Any IRS hero who happens to be reading this need not worry one bit about our loyalty to dutifully pleasure them with our money in our desire to reward their greatness. I believe that should clear it all up. When I gave the Bitcoin to my nephew I showed him several locations for places to use it. I also told him he could just keep it for a while since I figured it would reach $100 some time this year.I hope he has checked it out by now, he will be pleasantly surprised.  Will definitely keep them in mind when shopping for a vehicle. Though I doubt I would likely get a Jeep (though I have my eye on a Dodge Sprinter), I see that they have used vehicles that I could keep an eye on. bitcoin/gold? You would think with the openness of Bitcoin that there would be enough metrics to get a good idea for the market price based upon mining difficulty/cost of mining/daily Bitcoin transfers/MtGox daily volume.There should tend to be some link to the price of mining. There is the auto corrector if the price goes too far beyond the price of mining that more people will start mining instead of buying on an exchange.Though with the current ASIC delivery unknown, the price has sort of decoupled from the mining cost. Though you could certainly calculate the price compared to the cost of mining with GPUs to get a tidbit of information.The amount of money coming into Bitcoin would be the main indicator of market value. Though that is hard to pin down. Daily volume of the blockchain and MtGox can give some indicators. Actually, the faster the price rises the more businesses can use those earnings to hire people to develop things further.I am working on my website myself right now but I am hoping that Bitcoin reaches the point where I can pay freelancers to take over some of the work to make things more robust and more professional.The higher the price, the more development I can pay for (with the idea that I will get more return). I believe it will be over $1,000 and less than $5,000. I will buy things with my bitcoins.As for big "sells"...I will some day pay off my house with a small portion of my bitcoins. Hopefully before that happens I can find a mortgage company that will take payments in bitcoins.
Does this reading manual provide a source with lower fees? Bitcoin is more than just a currency.It has intrinsic value beyond the transfer of wealth. .5% trade fees? Pretty clear what that means everybody...     /    /   /_-Rocket ship to the moon!!! Actually the article was not that bad. He addressed some known concerns which are addressed among the community but which may not be that apparent to newcomers.We are about at the stage of a tech startup just releasing our product. We have done some internal testing but now we are exposing it to the world. There will be some growing pains and some valid criticisms. We just need to address them with a better product. We have a negative public image against those who are threatened by Bitcoin's success.I like the ones who live so deep in the world of people controlling the economy over math that they discount Bitcoin based upon the fact that they cannot find out more about Satoshi. The whole Bitcoin concept is a black hole to them without the ability to judge a system based upon the personality of its creator. It happens almost weekly.The key is that exchanges are just a convenience. But that convenience affects the price of Bitcoin by allowing people to easily move their money into Bitcoin.When it was just people on an IRC channel trading, the price was much lower.But as more exchanges pop up (which they can), the more decentralized things become.I have said this before, Bitcoin is demonstrating why patents are not as necessary as one would think. If you come up with an idea early and execute it well, people will use your product or service. You will be able to grow your business and grow that trust. As others try to copy your idea or product, they are at a disadvantage of trying to compete where you already have the advantage. It is on them to come up with new ideas and better service to take away market share from you.MtGox was out of the gate early and built that trust. It is on all other exchanges to prove themselves or offer something that MtGox does not offer (new ideas). Who, exactly, is this request directed to?There are ways to not pay fees. Check the board.I usually do not pay fees. But I only send coins every once in a while.What are you spending on that costs such huge fees? Ok guys, we may as well give it up. We have all been trying to cover up this flaw in the system so that the government does not enact this strategy.I will be the bigger man and step forward to tell the truth. This is a huge vulnerability.The US government and the Federal Reserve could wipe us all out by pouring tons and tons of money into Bitcoin.I hope they do not do that, it would be so disasterous that I cannot imagine.But we must admit this and hope that no Federal agent or someone close to the Federal Reserve reveals this to them, otherwise they may just go ahead and destroy Bitcoin by buying over and over and over.I am just glad that no government officials are reading this now. If they were, I hope they would not go to their bosses with multi-billion dollar proposals to buy everyone's bitcoins. They would likely become heros among their peers and get laid...a LOT...once it all works. It appears that it is Exante that is dealing with the large loads:"Exante, a Malta-based asset manager, set up a Bitcoin fund last year that was largely intended as a fun punt. Wealthy investors each put in $1,000 when Bitcoins were trading at $13 on the understanding they could lose the original investment. Exante predicted that public and media interest would take off when Bitcoins were trading at $100. Managing partner Gatis Eglitis  claims they are now getting 20 calls a day from large asset managers looking to invest up to $100m." Ever had to move $1 million in printed money?Me neither.But it is done daily. In armored trucks. A few men driving huge gas guzzlers all day.That money then sits in a vault, in a bank with security systems, lights, temperature control, staff, phone systems, computer systems, those workers driving to and from the bank, customers driving to and from the bank, etc...Or just stay at home, trade BTC online. Set your price based on the price at http://www.bitcoinity.comIt will go through. Just to clarify...are you saying we should sell? Since the price has already hit $147 there are no psychological barriers between here and there. Thousands of mesh solar mining rigs placed all over the country will become commonplace. Insanity. I just put my last buy in at $126 and it dropped a few seconds later to $114.Done selling, I made a $1,200 mistake selling some at $99 hoping that it would dip a few dollars after hitting the $100 psychological barrier.I will just buy when I have cash no matter the price. This is too much. It only needs just a bit more energy than that which would be able to attack it. Thank you, apparently from the home page it just freezes. lol Same here.I plan on selling 20k BTC when I finally do get in though.
Apparently someone has the following business plan:buy 1000 malware bots on the dark net for $500Set up $10,000 worth of buy orders at 30% below current MtGox price.DDOS MtGox until the price falls to your buy orders.Price returns.30% price rise$2,800 profit I have money in an exchange...it is called MtGox.Just sitting there...waiting for me to log in when it is back up to $140. I thought Coinbase was crowd funded. Buy? How? Prolexic is buying some cheap bitoins! I know this flies in the face of most people here, including myself. But I am wondering how this would fare..Set up a group of people who have large holdings and interest in Bitcoin and have them use their large holdings to stabilize the price of Bitcoin.Bitcoin may have a $1 Billion market cap but it is mainly the amount traded on MtGox that determines the price. Something that could be easily controlled with just a fraction of the full Bitcoin economy.If the group were to set huge ask and bid walls around a set number, while still raising or lowering on a regular basis as market trends indicate (much like the Fed board meeting to set interest rates), then we could have a bit more stability and we could avoid huge swings either way.Of course, if the market is too heavy either way and they underestimate the market pressure they could lose one of their walls and lose money so it would be in their interest to follow the market closely and rise and fall at a sustainable rate that the market is calling for.It could even be advertised that the rate will be going up or down at X% per day so people could plan accordingly. If a major event occurs the rate can be changed.Judging from some of the walls, a half million dollars worth on each side would probably help to lead the market and hold off on any major wall falling. I unfortunately took some money out at $99.I had set the sell of 100 BTC way back when it was at $47 just in case a super skyrocket person drove the price way up.Unfortunately I kept it around when it was in the low 90s figuring it would pop up to $99 before falling back down due to the psychological $100 barrier.But I went to sleep at $93 and woke up at $105...missed it.Fortunately I did not have 100BTC still in my MtGox account.I believe I stuck another 100BTC sell at 5000 for the same reason...plus I would be selling half a million dollars worth. I am considering hitting Berlin on a vacation this year because of the 3-4 restaurants that accept Bitcoin.But I would be willing to consider any other place in the world if it became BTC central. I believe this would be the biggest problem. Lock up your women if this unthinkable tragedy ever occurs.  It was climbing this fast from $60 to $93 (with a weekend break around $75). Which would be easier to stop? Is the sound my coffee mug made when I dropped it after seeing how fast Bitcoin's price is going up!!! It is me. I own 10 million bitcoins.Tomorrow I will sell them all.Or the more likely scenario...this is a big world with a lot of people who are just now hearing about Bitcoins and are investing (especially with the price in China and Europe jumping ahead of the US price). I took a vacation in Zimbabwe a few years ago and bought a wooden basket for 1000 Zimbabwe dollars.Before I left, knowing that I could not fit the basket on the plane I was able to sell it for 2000 Zimbabwe dollars.I made a profit of 1000 Zimbabwe dollars in a week! I had more wealth!Even though the value of Zimbabwe dollars went from $1/1000 Zimbabwe dollars to $1/10,000 Zimbabwe dollars that same week.Did I profit? I agree...a high plateau like this: Last I checked we are just past parity with Office Depot and US Airways.But all of the ones nearby are mainly banks or foreign companies. I was fortunate to at least get some in at $22/BTC this time.But after the IRS is paid...I am back in the game. In July of 2011 I took $10,000 out of my Roth IRA. I bought about 700 BTC at $14/BTC. I was hoping my money would follow the pattern and triple by the time I needed to make a balloon payment that next spring for $30,000.Instead, by that spring the price of Bitcoin was down to $2-$4/BTC.So I had to take $30k out of my 401k to pay for the balloon payment.Taking $30k out means a 10% penalty of $3000 plus you have to pay income taxes on that as well (at around 30% that's another $9,000).So that is $12,000 I owe the IRS this year. I also took a lot more out of my 401k for other things. So I owe the IRS a lot.Back in the fall, seeing a large IRS bill coming up and no extra funds sitting around I had to go with the only way I can make that kind of money...I shipped off to Afghanistan.And here I sit, making a bunch of money that will go to the IRS instead of into Bitcoin. Just make sure you can cover the taxes and penalties for next year's tax bill even if Bitcoin crashes. So your friends or family may not get this whole "Bitcoin" thing and just "don't trust it", so they will not put any money into it.Fine, their choice. But if they must keep their money in dollars, at least tell them that on https://www.bitfinex.com/ they can be getting 244% interest on their dollars.So anyone who knows about Bitcoin right now can either be making 2000%+ in Bitcoins or 244% value in dollars.That is not a bad spot to be in.Does anyone see any downside to the 244% interest? I was going to tell my family (who I told about Bitcoin when it was at $11/BTC) that at the very least if they are not investing in Bitcoin they should get 244% interest on their savings. You mean like Bitcoin Magazine? http://bitcoinmagazine.com/
True, if I factor in the amount lost by selling so much last year I am actually in the negative.  I think MtGox adds a 0 at the end of their waiting list.Have you ever seen a queue number without a 0 at the end? Darn, had a buy at $98.5 all set to go. When was this? I did not see it go below $102 on MtGox.btw, I lost the site for the live charts...MtGox live does not work for me at work or in my room. Last month I paid 1.4BTC for my hosting service. This month I will be paying closer to half a bitcoin.That, I like.  I am glad I did not stop buying when it was at $35.  Wow...with the amount of people making more with the climb in Bitcoin price, I am wondering if people are thinking the same thing as me...drop this 12 to 12 job and start a Bitcoin business When an ASIC miner is just a matter of Joe six pack buying a box at the store and plugging it in supplying his wifi and Bitcoin address the price will even out with the price and difficulty of the miner and the network will be impossible to hack/regulate. lol   oops Just curious.I come into work some days thinking, holy crap...I made more money last night than I will make all day at work. The price is only 10.3 cents per mBTC.  I also have more in my Bitcoin wallet than the net worth of California.State auditor: California's net worth at negative $127.2 billionhttp://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/03/state-auditor-california-net-worth-at-negative-127-billion.html I lost all of mine on SatoshiDICE.  Sorry Feds. Also the .55% exchange rate is pretty nice. As a small time illegal tobacco dealer I am trying to work my way up to the big time, maybe even become an illegal tobacco mob boss or something. Hopefully hit the $25-$30 billion range in illegal tobacco sales. Then I will convert to Bitcoin for all trades.By illegal tobacco it is usually selling non-FDA approved cigarettes in the back alley or distributing packets of cigarettes without a warning label. All very dangerous of course, but it is a dangerous world, such is the life of an illegal tobacco dealer.  There are many mortgage companies out there, not necessarily banks just mortgage brokers.There is no reason they could not accept bitcoins via BitPay for payment.I would switch my mortgage over to a company willing to do that. (if the rates are reasonable) I will be using mBTC for all units on my website. They have stock splits for a reason. See this thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=154954.0 If you were also deaf you could sure play some mean pinball.(when posting, instead of "new post", there is an option for "new poll") 
Wow, damn that sucks. I guess policy has changed since I first set it up.Hopefully with MtGox moving to the US they can bipass dwolla. After you have your Bitcoins, do a search on this website or google for vanitygen Download the vanitygen.exe and run it (preferably on a computer not connected to the Internet).Get your public address and private address.It is up to you on how you wish to safeguard these two addresses. The public address does not need to be safeguarded, you can use it openly. The private address needs to be kept safe. Tattoo it to the bottom of your foot, write it down, print it out, turn it into binary and make a piece of art out of it, etch it into the foundation of your house and cover it with flooring, engrave it into your ring, memorize it, etc...Send your bitcoin that you want to store for a long time to your public address.Keep some spending money in your online wallet, however much you do not mind losing. You can keep it on MtGox or wherever.None of this requires downloading the wallet for those still waiting.Did I mention you need to keep that private key safe? If you missed that...keep the private key safe, do not lose it! I will post the MtGox way just because that is the way that I know.Go to http://www.dwolla.com and sign up for an account. Link your dwolla account to your bank account. (this will take a few days)Go to http://www.mtgox.com and sign up for an account. You will have to fill out a bunch of verification information (scanned drivers license, utility bill, etc). (this will take a few days)Once your dwolla account is verified, go to dwolla and add funds from your bank account. (this will take a few days)Once funds are in your dwolla account go to MtGox and do "add funds", choose dwolla. Click on the code they provide and follow the steps.You will have funds in your MtGox account at that point after a few hours up to a day or so.From there you can trade at .56% or so. But if everyone saved and had their own safety net to fall back on then why would we need gov...ahh....  The guy has some convoluted idea of what his ideal currency would be which is different than any other definition of currency, then he goes on to explain why Bitcoin does not match his definition.Webster's dictionarycurrency: something (as coins, treasury notes, and banknotes) that is in circulation as a medium of exchange, a common article for bartering  I agree, I used to talk about this a lot early on because it was not yet viable for a business to use BTC. BitPay has helped a lot in that regard but we are still not quite up to the billion dollar company that we should be.Think of it like a dotcom startup that just went live and are making a shitload of money and have a lot of customers but they were not quite ready for such volume. We need to scramble to get things in place to join the big boys. It would be at this point that Satoshi would have sold to Microsoft or Facebook for a huge profit. But we do not have that option. I trust the few coins I have for exchanging on MtGox. I have the routine down of transferring money from my bank account to MtGox (through Dwolla).I tried CoinBase, it was fairly straightforward to buy 1 BTC but I referred a friend to that site and he is pissed because he wanted 10 BTC and was only able to buy 1 at $93 and now has to wait for that to go through until he can buy more as the price climbs.I like BitFloor but with the amount of money they owe, I do not see them making it, and thus the higher risk of them potentially owing me at some point.I do admit that the verification part of MtGox sucked when trying to get money out. When I needed money quickly last fall I had to end up taking my bitcoins out and sending them to BitPay through my wife's business to get dollars.Also, my buddy will not be able to get his MtGox account verified because we are out here in Afghanistan and have no utility bills to prove our residency.I should check out the other exchanges but have not gotten around to it since I am already able to move money in and out of MtGox fairly easily.Also, I believe you can request your $10k monthly limit get raised. It is more for your protection from being hacked than anything else. I had $1k to spend and I went on Google and typed in 'money' and clicked on Google's "Are you feeling lucky" button.That took me to MtGox which I had no clue about but I went ahead and put my money into this "Bitcoin" thing out of random chance.Then to my luck, this random thing called Bitcoin gained 10X in value.Boy was I lucky.Or there is the other scenario...I subjected myself to risk which could have ended up with me losing all of my money but having studied the underlying technology and having a good knowledge of how money works and the current political climate I understood that there was value to be found in Bitcoin so I invested my time and money into Bitcoin. It just so happened that others did the same and that such value was not stifled. I am still under the same understanding of the risk and continue to watch the climate for signs that such value is to be stifled where I can then re-invest elsewhere. I have seen this said a few times "you would be crazy to spend it when its rising so much in value".I do not understand this. Sure, at face value thinking that you have X Bitcoins today that are of value Y, why would you get rid of X Bitcoins today when tomorrow their value will be 2Y?But then how do you spend money? Do you keep fiat currency and spend that? That makes even less sense! Why keep fiat currency?If you hold Y dollars that are worth X Bitcoins that will tomorrow be worth .5X Bitcoins, why have dollars?My contention is that most of us are paid in dollars. We all have to pay for things. The best possible scenario for you would be to convert your dollars to bitcoins as quickly as possible and then  use it for spending.Otherwise, if you get paid and then wait a week to spend your fiat, then you have just lost a week worth of value gain.You would be crazy to spend dollars when having dollars to spend in the first place is crazy. Most wars have been fought over currency.They will fight. Our concept is sound, but we are still small. Ya, I guess that is a haphazard way of doing it.I was also thinking it would be great to be able to search for an item on only Bitcoin accepting online stores. Sort of like google products but for Bitcoin.I do not like paying for things with fiat. But I cannot search every bitcoin store to check to see if they have the product I need first. I have thought of something similar.A site where several people can offer up trading with price and icons for the different ways that they will accept cash (wire, bank deposit, ing p2p, dwolla, etc).It could provide tools and APIs for both seller and buyer to help them more easily trade on their own.And of course, allow for ratings and statistics on each person's trades to help people get a better feel for who is the most trustworthy.Though with FinCEN saying that any currency conversion requires a license, it could severely limit any US people doing trades. Bitcoin also does not ride a motorcycle and say "AAAAAAAAAeeeeeeee" I was curious about this myself.I assume that this is different than encoding a message that can later be decoded with a password? I am going to get myself a Dyson sphere to run my mining rig. Then I will have the best mining rig on the plant.  I allow it. And the store is charged 2-4% for that charge. Bitcoin allows for paying without that charge making products cheaper.A currency backed by the security of cryptography instead of paying for large vaults and armed guards.You can get hacked in the same way that someone can hack your password for your bank account online. There is a lot of software and services out there that will help you secure your funds with more options popping up all of the time.The inherent value of Bitcoin is its security safeguarded by more computing power than any other computer system in the world. It is built upon a cryptography (SHA256) which is used by businesses and governments to safeguard their data. It would take more energy and more time than the universe possesses to crack SHA256 and if that unlikely event ever happened, there would be a lot more to worry about than your money. And with the open source nature of Bitcoin, the cryptography can always be upgraded.Most electronic gold requires a central repository of the gold which requires payment for guarding and securing that gold. Being centralized, it can also be confiscated or regulated by the government. Bitcoin is peer to peer and thus has no central location which can be attacked.The built in protocol of Bitcoin only allows for 21 million bitcoins to ever exist. There is no way to ever create any coins beyond that.That is fine, I am just trying to educate you on the basics of Bitcoin. There are a lot of smart people out there who understand more than I could ever explain about Bitcoin and they are building infrastructures around it. It will likely be the case at some point where you will be using Bitcoin and do not even know it. Those who understand it early are able to benefit from a little bit of research and a little bit of knowledge. I just hope that when you do end up using Bitcoin, you will have a basic understanding of what it is you are using.Some stores may and have offered discounts for using Bitcoins since they save money on the transaction fees. Or it may give a business that accepts Bitcoin a market advantage against their competitors. Either way, it is up to the retail store to decide for themselves. I have seen it before, DVD froze toward the end though. I know...while taking Calculus 4 I also took Econ 101. I skipped a lot of the Econ classes because "it's just simple arithmetic" right?Not so much...I think I got a D in Econ 101. Crazy voodoo math.I later took Accounting for my Master's degree and determined not to make the same mistake I listened to the lecture on credits and debits about 20 times until it finally "clicked". After failing the first few homework/quizzes, after it clicked I finally got it and finished the course with a B.
This...a Satoshi would be like our current Bitcoin. We would just have Satoshicents, mSTS, etc.  x = y = 32 -x^2= -xy x^2 - y^2 = x^2 - xy (x + y)(x - y) = x(x - y) x + y = x32+32 = 32 64 = 32 I plan on sending one bitcoin to this address:1ELWAR1qFQbfmpMhcsTaBniFRLewrYqGo2We should all do that, it would be some good celebrating. I am still of the strong opinion that Bitcoinica was manipulating the price.I believe that they would watch for some particularly high shorts or longs that were set up on a margin. They would drive the price either way just enough to squeeze out the margin before returning, along with the rest of the market, to its previous price point.For example.Let us say that the price was $5. I put in a $1000 short at a 10:1 margin where I only have 50 cents of margin (not sure what the exact numbers would be) to work with.I watch as the price starts going down (I only put the short because I saw something to indicate it would likely go down). My payoff threshold (the price where I can start to make money at 10:1 is at $4.75. The price goes down to around $4.80, $4.75 on a slow market driven drop...then BAM...out of nowhere the price skyrockets...money is just flowing into the buy orders over and over it shoots up and up and up...it gets to $5.55 then stops. I have been short squeezed, then it all turns around. Sell orders fly in, it goes back down to the $4.70-$4.80 range...Bitcoinica now has $1,000 more of my money. The market is as it should be. And I am stuck wondering wtf just happened.We kept referring to these massive sling shots as "the manipulator". I believe in some discussions they even admitted to that as being part of their business plan.After Bitcoinica "got hacked", "the manipulator" disappeared.I had about 800 BTC when I started trading on Bitcoinica. About 3 of those wild swings clued me into what was going on even though everyone claimed I just did not understand how margins worked. I was convinced and took out about 260 of my 300 remaining BTC about a week before it was hacked.The money traded on MtGox is a sliver of the $1 billion Bitcoin market. A million dollars could move that $1 billion market to $2 billion or $.5 billion. We are still open to manipulation when price becomes the factor. Bitcoin price is a google trends predictor. Trid to sign up but I received the message: "We were not able to create your account."What are your requirements for a business? Is being registered as an LLC enough? We do not need to encourage a price gain. We do not need to encourage people to "invest in Bitcoin".Bitcoin will sell itself as people use it for its intended purpose.There is no need to try to get other people on board to buy and hold. Why would you do that knowing that it will continue to raise in value on its own merits? Do you not have more money that you will make that you want to put into Bitcoin?When there is a debit card that will allow you to spend your local currency without the need for a bank account, people will willingly buy Bitcoins for that use. When someone wants to gamble online anonymously, they will willingly buy Bitcoins for that use. When people want cheaper goods online or services online, they will buy Bitcoin for that use. Flash crashes are for those who do not understand Bitcoin.I personally already keep a limit order at increasing intervals for lower prices whenever it gets close to a stable point. But it has been so hard to keep up that that last time I was able to do that was in the $40 range.Do it for your own benefit if you must.If the price is holding steady at $95 do this:$94 buy X BTC$93 buy X*2 BTC$92 buy X*4 BTC$91 buy X*8 BTC$90 buy X*16 BTC   etc   (X could be .1 or 1 or whatever you can afford)Then again, it is not often stable. Umm ya, people will try to influence you to buy or sell.Why not make your own decisions?There are bigger forces than your few BTC you are trying to buy low and sell high. Just buy or sell based on whether you want BTC or not. The race is on. Crap...money was moving from Dwolla to MtGox as it went down...not fast enough Maybe I will finally check out Tradehill. laggg...fortunately I left an old buy set up at $74  (deleted my $77 buy just before it lagged up) The pyramid scheme finally collapsed.Satoshi is cashing it all out!!!The sky is falling!!!Oh the humanity!!! SELL SELL SELL!!!   Hmm, I wonder how many other people are excited that Dwolla is slow on the draw.A buddy of mine was trying to buy his first Bitcoins at $93 on CoinBase. The transaction would not go through.  Dwolla is back up.My funda have not cleared yet though  Holy crap what happen?From $92 to $83 and falling... I predict price slowly dropping until Dwolla returns.Anyone with a buy queued up when it comes back up will be in for some cheap BTC. Please do...still waiting on Dwolla.
Rocket is docking for a re-fuel. I am still convinced that it was Bitcoinica that was the "manipulator". Such distinct buying/selling or selling/buying went away right when Bitcoinica went away.The chart right there is probably when I put 100 BTC shorted at $2.95 and squeezed out at $2.50. It always stopped exactly below the loss point before jumping back up to where it was. So how long before Bitcoin passes $32 based on this chart? Hmm...that brings to question...how many people are watching for BTC to go over $100...and how many of those would like to cause some disruption when it happens? I sold 20 BTC at $79 thinking it would fluctuate a bit more before hitting $80. I came into work the next day and it was at $88.I bought back in. I have 2 less Bitcoin than I used to.How many Bitcoin do you want to lose?I am fortunate that I only sold 20. I took most of my BTC off of the exchange when it was at $60. Who is the bigger fool? The fool or the fool who follows him? I just bought 1 BTC and distributed them evenly to 666 people.Now I am without BTC  That is why I included Aruba and Fiji right afterwards. The last few countries were sexy...the next few are kinda lame. Niger, Cambodia, Suriname, Laos, Tajikistan. I think the country to go for would be Estonia. Or as they are calling it E-stonia as the Internet is very prevalent there. It used to be, if price was way above difficulty it would make sense to just run out to the store and buy a mining computer and lots of GPU instead of going to the exchange.Now it is a matter of waiting for a batch waiting list to make some ASICs available to order some machines that may arrive in half a year. Hmm, I think I have some money going into Dwolla today.It may become a race once Dwolla comes back up to get it to Gox as the longer Dwolla is down, the more the money gets stacked up in a queue. Thank You. This is an easy way to encourage your town officials to accept Bitcoin without the need to explain anything about Bitcoin.You can push e-gov link as a modern alternative to their old way of handling things.Hmm, my county uses Civic Plus http://civicplus.com/ I will encourage them to use e-gov link while also pressuring Civic Plus to accept Bitcoin. Imagine if you were jewish during WWII living in London. Your jewish friends and relatives have been seeing some very anti-jewish sentiment spreading and are uneasy about your own safety and start to talk about possibilities of people starting to come after jews.After hearing about jews being rounded up in Germany, would you go out and buy a gun?

I wrote this up last night before it hit $1 billion, distribute at will:With 10,960,750 bitcoins in circulation at a price of $94.50/BTC, Bitcoin has surpassed the market cap of one billion dollars.If Bitcoin was a stock, it would still be considered a small-cap company until it reaches $2 billion, but given that March 6 (just 22 days ago) Bitcoin had a $.5 billion market cap, it could be a short time before Bitcoin joins the ranks of the mid-cap companies.Some companies of note that currently hold a $1 billion market cap are Office Depot, Freddie Mac, and US Airways (http://www.forbes.com/global2000/).With Bitcoin prices holding around $4/BTC this time last year, a price of $94.50/BTC today shows a 2360% increase, if the price value were to rise as much over the course of the next 12 months, we could be seeing the price as high as $2,232 this time next year. This would surpass the revenue of the United States video game industry. Such growth will certainly pique the interest of industry leaders and investors looking to get a piece of the market and join the many venture capitalists who have started putting some serious money into Bitcoin businesses, such as CoinLab's $500,000 (http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/04/24/coinlab-attracts-500000-in-venture-capital-for-bitcoin-projects/) venture capital investment and BitPay, which has just received additional seed funds following their initial $510,000 investment (http://www.floridaventuresourcing.com/2013/03/bitpay-raises-additional-seed-funds/).If Bitcoin was a country, it would be greater than the market value of the Democratic Republic of Congo, whose M1 stands at $1,016,000,000. This, after having passed Aruba ($868,500,000) and Fiji ($794,600,000) earlier in the week (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2214rank.html). Perhaps this will inspire some small country that wishes for a currency that does not lose value to switch to Bitcoins and reap the benefits of it. The trouble these days with the Internet is the ISPs. They are the weakest link in between us and the government.To create a mesh around the ISPs but can still connect to the Internet is the way to go.I believe that Bitcoin is the key to funding such a thing. I would be fine with becoming an Internet repeater that generates Bitcoins on a pay per use type of structure.And like many who have been looking at the pirate boxes, setting up solar powered repeaters all over town (on top of light poles, tall trees, water tower, etc.) to create a full mesh would bipass the whole need for an ISP.If people can set up repeaters and get paid like people are getting paid to mine, we could reach the point where the mesh grid is more widely accessed than ISPs.
Sexual exploitation of children is not victimless. Up 300% since this post...hmm, I think he should have bought. Have we reached the point of everyone knowing and having the choice of getting themselves some Bitcoin if they wish? Like with gold. We are in a bubble. And it will likely pop mid 2013.http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/03/27/peter-schiff-market-crushing-treasury-collapse-to-hit-around-2013/ An exchange of services between consenting adults...which one is the victim? Are you claiming that the guys are getting ripped off? The rise in cost could very well be the adoption by drug lords of Bitcoin use. The billions spent per year by drug cartels could make it mainsteam.But it may have a different affect. Silk Road may be doing to the drug cartels what Bitcoin is doing to the central banks. Would you like to place a bet on this?I will randomly take the side of $1 billion cap... Ahh, I see that now...Last Price: $89.75  High: $89.499999999999999999 Did you mention it before, as in the future?If so we have not seen that post yet.What do I have for breakfast tomorrow? Do I get sick? Should I have something else? It is the only currency my company currently pays. And it is not like the miners are getting paid $324k per day. That would be like saying that a new tech company was paying a million dollars a month to their workers when they are really only paying reasonable salaries along with stock options. Miners are basically being paid stock options. The money traded on the exchanges makes up a fraction of the Bitcoin economy. If everyone were to try to sell their Bitcoins today, we would see nowhere close to $1 billion shelled out. You are probably right. I just took an old number I found when the reward was 50 and halved it. Please do not invest in Bitcoin. I still have more money to put in and would rather the price stay low while I do so.When it comes time to move into Bitcoin when it is necessary or much more convenient/cost efficient, you will at least have some understanding of how it works.Enjoy the fiat. The international transfers I saw on WU's website showed a 3 day transfer unless you do it all online. This, I believe, is what people seem to be missing. Dump her because she's a lawyer.And..redundancy is redundant Bitcoin is currently in inflationary mode.The current inflation rate of Bitcoin is around 17%, far beyond what the dollar's inflation is.And yet it is attacked for its "deflation".Keynesians should be loving Bitcoin right now.If nobody new were buying bitcoins, you would be losing 17% of your wealth by keeping your funds in bitcoins.But new people are buying...at a rate faster than inflation. Bitcoin was a major source of contention between myself and my late wife. I bought in July, 2011 at around $14/BTC. I cashed out $10k from one of my IRAs, I saw the potential in Bitcoin and knew it would be big. I traded a bit at MtGox as it went down and got up to 800BTC. Then I got on Bitcoinica as the price dropped a lot and desperate to get my money back I did a lot of shorting and a lot of losing bitcoins. I pulled everything out of there as it appeared that manipulation was a bit too precise in taking my BTC away. I had about 250 BTC left. I pretty much had to tell my wife that the whole Bitcoin thing was a wash and that there was no money there. I was constantly reminded that I "threw away 10 thousand dollars on your stupid Bitcoins".Finally last October we were buying a house and needed $5,000 toward the down payment. Bitcoin was at about $11/BTC around then. We were scraping what we could get for the $5,000. I borrowed $2,500 from my brother and finally broke down and cashed out the rest of my bitcoins for the rest.Losing a loved one you play a lot of "what if"s. Had Bitcoin jumped like this last year instead of this year I likely would not have had to go to Afghanistan to get out of our financial problems and I could have been home with my wife...But anything can happen in life.She used to also complain about my time wasted supporting Ron Paul. Even though she supported him too, she knew that any action supporting him was a waste of time because they would never let him win. Would there be a way to branch off a local currency backed by the contents of a single address?Imagine there were 100 BTC in a single BTC address. Then this community that is on an island in middle of nowhere uses this address as their currency but runs their own mining software and exchanges coins back and forth between each other spawned from this single address.Then, if ever necessary, they could all put their money back into the one address and use it as BTC.I have no idea how something like that would work, I am just thinking of how it would work if a small community shut off from the rest of the world would be able to exchange their own local currency while still being technologically tied to Bitcoin. Ya, I think anyone can come up with a symbol and because we all as humans use objects we are familiar with to create new images we are bound to get things that come from somewhere else.I am working on a symbol for my site. I will post my reasoning here before I create it so that if someone sees a similarity between it and some ancient pagan symbol of tyranny, they will know where its shapes spawned from.The symbol will be a circle (why a circle? so that if I need to hand something out at trade shows, it will fit on a neat round coin...kinda like military units hand out)At the center of the circle will be something like an explosion...like the start of a chain reaction the the beginning of a star being formed.Around that will be a bunch of arrows pointing inward toward that explosion. Basically each arrow represents an individual coming together to create something big.I will try to get the name of the website in there too...I have not figured that out yet.And I am no artist so I will likely hire someone to do the design for me. They will likely use some experience from art school or somewhere else that has traditions going back centuries.So if it turns out looking like the star of Ra the sun king or something from the Davinci code revealing that Jesus is still alive with Elvis...then that is on you to run wild with. I see Bitcoin as a commodity IPO.Think of Gold as Microsoft and Bitcoin as Google in the late 90s.  Whereas Microsoft has pretty much reached its investment plateau and will rise and fall with technology changes, early Google was still small and had a lot of room to grow. Now Google and Microsoft are more closely coupled as far as tech companies go.Bitcoin and gold will rise and fall as a commodity based upon world events and the devaluation of fiat currencies. But Bitcoin is still relatively unknown and has a lot of technology going into it to make it better. On that side of it, the price grows rapidly as would an early tech stock.Once Bitcoin has the reach and availability that gold currently has, it will more closely rise and fall with respect to fiat's fall and rise.But they will always have their own gains and losses based upon specific aspects of their own technology. A new gold mine discovered, a fad of wearing more gold in one country, adoption as a currency, etc. While Bitcoin could have major wallets hacked, exchanges regulated, mining hardware changes.Gold is not always coupled with silver for the very reason that they are two different metals with different uses and mines. But to the extent that they react to the fiat currencies, they should have similar reactions.
The Federal Reserve is currently pumping $1 billion into the Federal Reserve Note per day. Is this a reasonable amount? Moral of the story...the government can come after your dollars. Bitcoin is still untouched.Stay out of fiat if you can. $500 -> Dwolla: $.25$500 Dwolla -> MtGox: $.25$500 MtGox -> X BTC: $2.75XBTC -> International recipient XBTC: less than a penny XBTC -> MtGox $500: $2.75$500 MtGox -> Dwolla: $.25Dwolla -> $500: $.25Total cost: $6.50ATM fee if withdrawing cash: $2.00 (if not using your bank ATM)New Total: $8.50 (if not using your own bank ATM)And that is international transfer, and the recipient can cash out in their own currency and not pay extra for currency exchange. And a bigger bonus...they could just keep it in Bitcoins and spend it. Big difference there  $10* fee sends up to $500!!!*within the US I will be defaulting to BTM (or mBTC) when I get my website up and running. It will be easier to say a user has 100 BTM instead of .1 BTC. OP should get SCAMMER tag. Would you pay $81 for something that will be worth $100 in a few weeks and $1000 in a year? I said you may  be pleased.Might not too...I know I would be pleased. What you could do to lock in Bitcoins at the current price while using a credit card is this:Find something on the Internet that you think a Bitcoin user would likely want to buy in the price range of the amount of money you are wanting to spend.Post the item for sale on BitMit.Wait for someone to buy it.Get their address, go to the site where you can purchase the item. Pay for the item with your credit card and have it shipped to the person.The price is locked in, once the person receives their item you will get your bitcoins. I think I like Toga better. You will get the most bang for your buck by buying one BTC and sending it to the Bitcoin address in my signature.I will tell you how this helps afterwards. You may be pleased by the result. This alone will send the price up a couple hundred. It did not even fluctuate 10 cents.Your trolling skills suck, you have proven that you do work in the media. Go back to the teletype. Here comes the rocket. So does this mean that I sold all of my Bitcoins for no reason?I believed the OP the whole time, I was just acting like I did not. The worst that could happen is "politicians in parliament are looking into how to crack down on Bitcoin".If they had passed anything, we would have all known.Politicians have been trying to crack down on Bitcoin ever since they have caught wind of it.They do not realize that their cracking down is the exact reason why Bitcoin is winning. Bitcoin being discussed on a national program in a continent of people losing money in their bank account?BUY BUY BUY!!! It was 8 hours until you got called out on your time zone. Now it is on the 11:30PM news program? Nobody who actually works in the media has ever been on the Internet. If they were on the Internet, they would have known in 2008 and 2012 that Ron Paul existed.
Dude, you just cannot catch a break. You set your time zone in your profile. You live in Western Europe time zone. It is already "tonight". Almost 10PM. Will this be on the midnight Belgium cooking channel? I believe this secretive OP thread over some kid with 3 posts trying to get BTC at a good price. Nice, this is getting worse and worse.ten four good buddy Yep, it had about as much impact back then as any "news" story would have about some politicians talking about cracking down on Bitcoin.Everyone knows by now that the "National media" does not report news, they regurgitate shit that we all already know about online. If it is not yet on the Internet, the media does not know about it.  You mean like this:Senators seek crackdown on "Bitcoin" currencyhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/08/us-financial-bitcoins-idUSTRE7573T320110608 Dude, you are so busted. I found this archive of your post from earlier today.Nice try though. Buy at the current price like the rest of us, it will rise on its own. Bitcoin price is cheap right now. Some information from TurboTax on bitcoins.http://blog.turbotax.intuit.com/2011/07/18/bitcoins-the-taxless-currency/ Good article. I am privy to some information in my pants...none will want to believe the events once they have unfolded. Hmm, I did get a notice that this week's money has left my bank account. Maybe it will make it to MtGox in time for some good buying opportunity.Crash away (for a few hours). Someone must not have received the memo about not spending their depreciating currency.http://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address= I am actually implementing something close to this on my site.Anyone can create an account but you will have very limited access until you provide a Bitcoin address that is proven to be yours.After that, you will have more privileges. I will give a reason and a chart.Bitcoin will skyrocket.Reason: $50 was a mental barrier, we held at $47 for a week. $75 was a mental barrier, we held just under $75 for 4 days. The next mental barrier is $100, expect it to reach $93 to $99 and bounce around for a bit. (I literally put a sell order in at $99 for half of my bitcoins knowing that this will certainly happen)Chart:__/ The world is huge, full of a lot of people. As different corners of the world pick up on Bitcoin, it will lurch forward and most of us will have no idea where it is coming from. This is not your father's currency.   Is it the MtGox one where you can put anyone else's public Bitcoin address in the url and automatically get all of their bitcoins? That is why the deflationary currency, gold, was never used as money any time in history. It has always been the dollar. I showed my 73 year old mother how to exchange bitcoins on her iPhone. It was quite easy. I have considered checking out the program running this job search:https://sjobs.brassring.com/1033/ASP/TG/cim_jobdetail.asp?jobId=266229&partnerid=25037&siteid=5010&codes=in-indeedThough I do not have financial analyst experience and do not speak Dari Pashtu. But I bet they probably have a computer system that analyst works on that I could help with.I also rather spend most of my time deployed as opposed to having to endure Reston, VA. I am sure that the anarchist society in iceland had no roads. Everyone had to live on the sea and take boats to get anywhere.Because everyone knows that there would be no roads without government.
"what about the roads?!?" in 5...4...3...2... Does the ruling help or hinder the possibility of getting a debit card where you can store your BTC and spend your local currency via a debit card? For it to reach $1,000/BTC a year from today it would have to go up over 1300%!!!It has not done that since...hmm...what is $75 divided by $4 (price this time last year) * 100%? An anarcho capitalist society would not tax in the first place.And if it were to redistribute the taxes that someone forced upon them, they would redistrubute based upon what people paid in. 4 5 Profit!Error 4: unreachable statement They spelled Xanadu wrong. Hmm, it would be interesting to see the parity between the highest amount of BTC in one address and wether or not they can yet buy a country.111111 BTC * 75.6 = ~$8.4 million.Montserrat: $ 16,170,000 Edit: missed the 8 What do they taste like? What flavor is the red one? Is it cinnamon or cherry? Or strawberry perhaps?And the blue...is it like drinking blue kool-aid? Or is it blueberry?This is very important toward my decision. Do you mean gaming or gambling? And what do we do about the $246 billion we owe in interest to the federal reserve?Or the $940 billion in medicare/medicaid welfare program?Or the $882 billion in social security welfare? Awesome...pass this redistribution plan so that we can all quit our jobs. Short the dollar! I like how people throw out the word GREED like it is a bad thing.Like we are automatically supposed to start geering at the bad greedy person. Shame on them for trying to get ahead. STAY BEHIND WITH US SO WE CAN ALL BE MISERABLE...TOGETHER! When it crashed all the way to $2 people were talking about whether or not Bitcoin was a viable concept.This "crash" has people talking about being able to buy at a lower price.I say crash...I have to do my taxes and owe money so my next few fiat paychecks are going to the Federal Reserve instead of Bitcoin.Then I will be back in. So just hold the price low for a month and we are good. Krugman's solution to stimulating the economy is aliens. Imagine it this way. Jack has a poker game at his house. Each person puts in $30 and gets 30 chips. 4 players, $120 120 chips. The pot will go to the winner.After playing for a while, Jack loses all of his money equally to the other players. Now those players each have 40 chips.Jack decides he wants to keep playing. He goes into the other room, grabs 40 more chips for himself. He drops an IOU for 40 chips to the winner of the game.But now there are 160 chips in the game making each chip worth 75 cents. At the end of the game he owes the winner for a quarter of the chips and a quarter of the winnings, $30. Even though when the game started a chip was worth $1 each.When the Federal Reserve prints money they lend it out to the big banks who lend to the big corporations. They are getting money for an IOU in the same way that Jack got 40 chips in exchange for an IOU. They pay it back after the money has circulated and lost value. And they get to spend it when the value is still high, until it trickles down to the average person.The poker game would be a lot different if instead of chips they used dollar bills, or if each chip was tied to the dollar. Then Jack bringing 40 new chips to the table would mean that he would owe $40 at the end of the game. Until 1971 the dollar was tied to gold in this way. But then they went off of the gold standard and we have had more and more inflation since then. I have paid the bitcoin client programmers through my investment in Bitcoin and thus the added value to their early obtained coins.I pay for this forum whenever I see a Bitcoin business advertised that eventually leads me to use that service.I pay for mtgoxlive through my transaction fees.Even if the developers did not have Bitcoin, the very fact that they are willing to work on the code for free shows that they are getting something out of it. If they were not, they would not be developing. The key in all of this is that it is all voluntary.To justify taxes you must justify the use of force against humans. I leave that to the tax supporters. Satoshi is a human. Humans have flaws. His flaws would be exploited and tied to Bitcoin.Ron Paul had a good idea to take the country back to the Constitution and promote liberty. They went after a hiring decision from the 90s for his newsletter to discredit him, and with it his principles. Very little overhead, the largest cost would be the intermediary between individuals forking over their money and the job getting done. Probably about the percentage you would pay a contractor to arrange subcontractors to build your house bringing together electricians, plumbers, etc.The time spent by individuals could vary. You could pop in whenever there is a vote and submit your vote or not even vote, handing your voting authority over to a proxy like in stockholder votes. The nitty gritty would be handled by people who are more passionate about such things, which there are usually plenty when it comes to something that will affect them.As for reaching sufficient amount of investors, that all depends on how much people want to get done and how much it will affect them. It would likely lead to a lot more small projects while large projects would take a long time (like a football stadium).Compared to the amount of paid staff that gets paid in government whether or not a job gets done or not, the overhead is a lot smaller. I agree, but for some reason people do not support the free market and thus perpetuate the lower class.
I think it would be cool to create a piece of artwork that had the binary 1s and 0s going across using something as a 1 and something else as a 0 in such a way that it looked pretty.Just put it up on the wall and display it for the world to see.Of course, it would have worked better if I did not mention it here.  disconnect right there I have thought of such a process as well.The whole "tax" thing is always the thing that gets in the way. Requiring someone to give up their money with no choice is akin to slavery.I believe the best system would be for any new citizens to be required to "buy into" their citizenship. This money could then be distributed in the way that you are speaking of.Each citizen would then have the option of supporting whichever projects they wish to support using their money.I would also contend that the citizen would actually have the option of just taking the money and leaving, but they would still be on the hook for spending that much money if they were wanting to return to citizenship.I am getting ahead of myself though...baby steps.Coming soon. Hmm...this is just crazy enough to work...this will be HUGE! True, it is still winter after all. Most people still keep their doors closed. The banks will never lose money, they just may get the chance to have all the Federal Reserve Notes that they want.As people sell their Bitcoins to pay off mortgages or credit cards or other debts owed to banks, the banks will then have that money back. If it reaches the point where everyone uses Bitcoins and the banks have all of the FRNs, then FRNs will be just about worthless.Now more than ever, people will be able to finally understand the following scripture:"Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's"Bring me a dollar that I may see it. Whose is the name on top of the dollar bill? "Federal Reserve"I say, give to the Federal Reserve the things that are the Federal Reserve's. Tattoo of my private key on my penis.In binary. I know exactly what he is talking about. As someone who has personally watched the Davinci Code I can consider myself an expert at decifering puzzles.He mentions behind "closed doors" like the closed door of a closet, a closet which he is in. This would mean that Vladamir is gay and that he will be coming out of the closet in 2015."some serious projects are being underwritten""If these projects come to fruition" Now the part about "very important for Bitcoin things"...who is the most important person in gay society? Liberace. Vladamir is going to buy a large blinged out pink Liberace type of piano with Bitcoins."Anyone parting with his coins at current silly  prices is going to deeply regret it" No you are so silly Vladamir. I doubt a pink piano purchase will change the price of bitcoins by much. It appears that they will be able to have everyone moved over a week early. Not bad.I wonder if it is in the US if I will be able to skip the Dwolla step in transferring money. As we have always seen. Google trends follows the rise of the bitcoin price.So bitcoin price is a good predicter of google trends.Use such information wisely. Say you and 9 buddies with 1k BTC each got together to spend 10k BTC, what would you spend it on?And you are actually spending it, not just holding it and watching it rise (unless it is to wait until a certain price to pay for something).Either to help Bitcoin, help yourselves, help others, etc... BitMit is miles ahead of ebay when it comes to selling something.I love knowing that I will be able to keep my money after I get it. $5.0 to $7.0 in 2 weeks! That is a huge rise. Must be a bubble!I wonder what happened after that. I am a Satoshi millionaire. I created a MUD way back in the day. I kinda handed it off to the other admins and semi involved developer.Last I checked it is no longer running.I assume people do not play MUDs anymore.Also you cannot modify a Merc/diku/etc code and charge money. The license does not allow for making money. Too many people dropping fiat and putting it into Bitcoin. I bet .1 BTC that Rand Paul will not be president in 2016. I put in the bet when the price was around $47/BTC. So a $4.70 bet for something 3 years from now.I figure if Rand Paul wins...good deal, I am only out $4.70 and the country is on its way toward getting back on track.If he loses, BTC will likely be over $10k each and I will win a buttload of money. They are asking 88 BTC for the ASIC.This may be the first major product to peg the BTC price to. Usually prices are pegged in dollars and bitcoins go up and down based upon the exchange rate. The problem with using hardware is that it changes and it could fail due to heat or moisture or rust or...Download vanitygen and create a public and private key.Write them down or etch them into metal or stamp it into something, etc.Send your BTC to the public address and you are all set.You could even scratch the private key into a rock and bury it in your yard or whichever. Etch it into the foundation in your home. Carve it into the wall in the closet then cover with wall paper...plenty of options for just saving a string of characters Plenty of places to put your money where your mouth is:Before April 30, 2014 Bitcoin will exceed USD$100/BTC http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=439Before 1st January, 2015 Bitcoin will exceed USD$100/BTC http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1260Before 1st January, 2016 Bitcoin will exceed USD$100/BTC http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1261The MtGox price of bitcoin will reach $120 USD before the end of 2014 http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1302 
What an idiot OP was...  I am calling a flattening out between $95 and $99 for about a week followed by a break through $100 and beyond. Fiji!I actually researched Fiji when country shopping. Beautiful island, their Constitution has been rewritten a few times in the past decade due to revolutions. They have native tribes there that the early governments appeased by including provisions for them in the Constitution. Each new Constitution has moved further away from accomodating them.I believe the latest Constitution they were writing was a bit more "progressive".In the end, I decided against it because while fairly advanced, it is still fairly third world when it comes to law enforcement and protection of property rights. Like Costa Rica you would have to worry about locals robbing you all the time.Reminds me of scenes from Final Fantasy Technically an adult but not  old enough to drink. The price spike is self perpetuating. When it broke $32 all bets were off. When articles about Bitcoin passing the all time high included a blurb mentioning that the price had doubled in the past month, people with money who want it to double jumped in.The fact that it has gone up 10% per day for the past 3 days will get people who want to have 30% more money in 3 days to invest. There are a lot of people who want that.If it starts to drop, the self perpetuation will continue in the other direction.We could be investing in dog farts, if the price were going up this fast, we would have people investing. There is a bitcoin run? Should we all rush to our wallets and withdraw? Just the impression I get whenever I am in DC (near the capital, etc.) of an air of superiority over us minions coming from the lowly rest of the country that they are caring for. maybe you should go on bitcams and explain the bitcoin economy for those who come along...get some BTC out of it You almost wrote my white paper for me...coming soon Has anyone done any calculations on the Bitcoin price based upon the cost to mine?A quick check at this calculator: http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator shows that at the current difficulty, a $1,500 60GH/s mining rig will produce ฿189 or $11,921 per month.I know that those ASICs are just starting to ship out, but at this price it would be smarter to buy an ASIC than to put that $1,500 in MtGox.Once those ASICs start shipping on the level of being able to buy a PS3, the price of Bitcoin will likely more closely mirror the cost to produce as opposed to being so high above the manufacturing costs.How many ASICs are currently on order and how much will this affect the difficulty? That is key to determining the target price level. Rwanda No, I usually put a buy or sell order far from the current price in case a huge swing sends the price soaring or dropping before coming back to a reasonable price. Had I set the sell to $62 instead of $65 I would have been able to take advantage when it shot up from $47 to $62 then back down to slowly climb from $52.We have a while before it evens out again. I will definitely switch my home owner's insurance. Although my house payments are currently escrowed, I would be willing to drop the escrow and pay everything separately if I can pay the insurance with BTC.I already contacted my loan provider and, as I suspected, they are not willing to even entertain taking payments in bitcoin.And I know there is no way I will be able to pay property taxes with bitcoins.I pay a lot in home insurance since I am on the Gulf of Mexico. Luck indicates that our concious decisions to take a chance on an unproven technology did not play a role.There are plenty of people who have heard of Bitcoin that have dismissed it and missed out on this "luck". My condolences(for being so close to DC) Not quite, I put in a 100 BTC sell order at $65 back when it was in the $40s just in case of a huge jump and fall. I saw that it got to $64.9998 and that it was holding in the $60s so I dropped it. Just sayin...worry less about getting robbed and more about if the guy is a cop. And they all happened to come from the same unknown person. According to FINCen, what you are doing is now illegal unless you pay $1 million and jump through some hoops to become a licensed money exchanger. Uh oh...how long does it take for difficulty to go up?
Is there a single web page that shows the latest price for each exchange?I looked on Bitcoin Charts and it only has 3 USD exchanges. math > governments Ok, that makes things more clear. But what is meant by "value that substitutes for currency"? Use an offline computer.Run VanityGen (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25804.0)Get a public key/private key.Write them down/engrave it on a ring/tattoo it to your penis.Go to MtGox and withdraw to Bitcoin, give your public key.No hacker can get to your private key unless they had some screen recording virus going on, even then you can encrypt your vanitygen key with a password that is not displayed.Just do not lose that private key. It is worth something...almost .5 BTC/oz (for now). FinCEN has just made it so that all dollars exchanged for bitcoins can be traced to some person. Whenever I bring up Bitcoin to people most of them say something like "they'll find a way to make it illegal".I can now say, "the US government has acknowledged Bitcoin and has put regulations in place for businesses exchanging dollars for bitcoins but are perfectly fine with people using bitcoins to buy and sell things" This part gets ignored but I am a bit confused by it.Everywhere else there is a distinction between virtual currency and real currency. This line just says "currency".   It is quite vaque in that it could say "if the person accepts (Bitcoin) from one person and transmits it(Bitcoin) to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of...value (that substitutes for currency)."  Would that mean that every node on the network transferring bitcoins from one person to another is an "exchanger and a money transmitter"? Once we reach parity with Fiji we should buy it.Or Aruba.Actually, someone should show this to these nations and encourage them to change their currency so that they can start climbing past the other countries as well. That is where I keep my wallet file. It is common sense for most of us but when I first started trading I kept almost all of my BTC on my exchange accounts. Fortunately someone posted something similar about not trusting your BTC on exchanges. I pulled almost all of my BTC out of Bitcoinica soon after that. A week later they got hacked. I have confidence in MtGox and I tend to trust a portion of my BTC in my account, but with their transition to the US and with prices going up so much bad things could happen.Transfer most of your coins to an offline wallet for a while, keep your private key secure.  I showed my mom (not technically savvy) coinbase.comIt allows you to just put in your bank routing and account number, you can either verify by giving your online bank login information or my mom did not trust that so she waited a few days for a couple of small deposits to be made and verified that way.From there you can just do a transfer and you are all set.(I bought 1 bitcoin through them first just so that I knew what the process was to guide her through it) Go pee again. It was in the $30s less than a week ago Including the reference to May 2011 when he said "we'll be at $25.00 within a few months". And there it goes. I always keep a few BTC queued up for major swings around the stable price. BTC price swings a lot.Sold 3 on the upswing, top one at $52.40Waiting to see where it evens out to place my next swing orders. The price still cannot go too far beyond the cost of mining bitcoin.As mining equipment becomes easier to use for the average person, several people may just opt to buy an ASIC to stick in the corner as opposed to buying through the exchange. I just gave my nephew a bitcoin for his birthday. He is 17, perfect age for learning about Bitcoin before going into the real world.
It has gone up 2% in the past week. That is better than most yields on savings accounts for a year. I agree. There are much better ways of doing this. Rocket has been re-fueled. I did not say that I want it, I was just trying to picture such a system. Historically the price rises up until the conference starts and then drops once people realize that it is not the media event that they were hoping for. I was thinking about what would be the perfect Keynesian coin, not that I would want it to happen but just thinking.The coin would delete any stagnant balances that have been around for more than x amount of days, maybe 3 months to a year (maybe even fluctuating based upon activity).The rate of new coins created would be based upon the amount of activity on the blockchain. As the rate increases, the reward goes up, as it slows down the reward goes down.And there would always be a minimum amount of coins created.And a government would have to require people to use it.Did I miss anything? Other than a group of men manipulating things manually. The only option at this point is http://www.seasteading.org Or something better than kickstarter that makes use of Bitcoin's unique features?coming soon Sitting on the sidelines frowning about all of these rich people buying ASICs so that they could get more rich is talk of someone who will never be rich.If you want some Bitcoin purchased pizza just go to http://pizzaforcoins.com/ If I were in the states I would only order through them when buying pizza. https://sjobs.brassring.com/1033/ASP/TG/cim_jobdetail.asp?jobId=266229&partnerid=25037&siteid=5010&codes=in-indeedIndustry Job Title CTF Analyst Sr Stf Standard Job Code/Title E2485:Intelligence Analyst Sr Stf Required skills Place of performance is Reston, Virginia. Analysts should also have financial investigatory/forensic accounting experience in non-traditional arenas including drug money laundering, Sharia-compliant banking, terrorist finance, informal and formal money transfer mechanisms (hawala), trade based value transfers, and parallel reconstruction. Knowledge of emerging alternative and mobile payment methods is also desired (Bitcoin, Secondlife, etc). I understand this concept. Killing is the action of taking someone's life. It is only murder if the action is deemed illegal.So what would be the equivalent word for theft? murder is to theft as killing is to...? Is there ever a case where the government could legally steal?The definition of theft is the "illegal taking...". Considering the government may pass any law they want and make it a "legal taking", is there anything the government would ever do that you would consider theft?This question is more for those who do not believe that taxation is theft. I find it interesting that in order for one of the arguments to be debunked, we Americans have to accept the fact that the Secretary of State may pass Constitutional Amendments.Meaning that right now, John Kerry is the most powerful person in the country.As for any tax loopholes or whatever, I understand that there are a lot of people with guns. They have decided that my money does not belong to me. Because I do not have more guns than they do and I do not wish to be shot or threatened to be shot until I am in a cell constrained there by said threat of being shot, I must hand over my money. It does not matter what laws actually say. The supreme court has even determined that if something is commonplace, that trumps the wording of the law. The fact remains that those with the most guns win. We are all subject to the whims of the majority of Americans. The same people who watch Fox News and CNN and think it is news, and the people who watch American Idol and go watch Justin Bieber. I agree with the freezer thing. Very important.Especially for Bitcoin. This is a good sign. If Alex Jones goes against Bitcoin then it is working. So the wealthiest 1% are currently the only ones mining?How astute.Your choice at this very moment to not take a risk on Bitcoin is exactly why you will never be in the top 1%. The Mark Zukerberg of today is on the forum right now figuring out the next big thing for Bitcoin. And s/he is probably living off of raman and bitcoin purchased pizza.  The actual Satoshi has not yet even been born. And the time machine inventor is just a glimmer in his mother's eye. Ya, I see too many bets that have a bet on something that could happen before the bet closes. That kind of defeats the purpose. Most mobile clients do not download the entire blockchain. They keep track of your wallet based upon your spends and receives.  I have struggled with this as well. I think the main solution many sites have come up with is to hold large amounts in cold storage (printing out to paper and keeping it somewhere safe) and only keep online funds necessary for automated transactions throughout the day.Also, there is the option of making it so that every spend done by the service requires a second authentication. I think I may go this route for almost all spends done on my site. Either require a text or e-mail or something. If it is thousands of tiny transactions then it may be best to just allow for the private keys to sit on the server. If there are thousands of large transactions then you are in a bigger business than any out there right now and you could hire people to help with that.But I am also curious as to other approaches.If you look at the $12,000 BitInstant hack, that is not actually too bad since they likely move a lot more money than that. So you may just need to price small thefts like that into your plan in exchange for quick automation.
Who is this "we"? Do you have a mouse in your pocket? I wonder what next week's crash low will be. Casascius wrote a program that allows for another option.Alice and Bob set up the application, put in their public/private keys. They both receive a code. The code is sent to Ed who holds the codes until the product is received. Ed can get nothing out of the codes.Once the product is shipped, Alice confirms and Ed sends the codes to Bob where Bob can now use the codes to unlock the Bitcoin.If the product does not ship, Ed can give the codes to Alice and she can unlock the Bitcoin.There is a thread about this somewhere around here. How does one detect a fork? Some guy in his basement can create a fork with his own new code but be useless due to most transactions going with the main fork, but it would still be a fork. The total amount of BTC traded the 10 transactions after block 225446 adds up to about 145k BTC. That is over $6 million at a price of $45/BTC.I wonder how much of that $6 million ended up being double spends too.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152348.0This is no hack of some Bitcoin service, this is a hit to Bitcoin itself.How low will the price go once this gets out? Ugh...this is worse than we thought.Is this the first double spend? I think the exchanges should stick to trading bitcoins with other currency. Not hours. Would the "Cyber Christ" say: "Render unto the Federal Reserve what is the Federal Reserve's."?They can have their notes. I will have my coins. According to http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/bitcoin-value-drops-23-percent-after-software-glitch-discoveredSo MtGox is going to suspend trading when bad things happen? I sent 1.5 BTC from MtGox to a WalletBit address: Bitcoin withdraw to 1QARSgpZ2um4n9JFBhMYTxBYXZsxEhEUb6 late last night using the Green Address option on MtGox.I think it was right around the time of the bug because the price crashed soon after and as I watched blockchain.info it went from an estimated 6 minutes to confirm down to 0 and then replaced with "Unknown".The confirmation still sits at "Unknown" as of this afternoon.Will it ever go through or did my BTC get lost in the ether?  I had to send 2 more BTC this morning because of the price change, I was trying to pay for my hosting service. So does that mean that the original client has to be running when the time lock expires, in order to broadcast the transaction? Thank You. I do have the bitcoinj code so I will go that route. I agree that putting all of it into Bitcoin over such a long time period is a high risk. I will likely combine it with gold or silver and put it in a safety deposit box or have her mother do so. Has the time lock feature been implemented yet? My wife passed away and she wanted the money from selling her boutique to go to her neice when she turns 18. She is 12 now so I would like to put a portion of that money in a bitcoin address I created for her and lock it until she is 18. I understand that it is likely not in any of the clients, but does the protocol support it? Person 1: Knock KnockPerson 2: Who's there?Person 1: GPPerson 2: GP who?Person 1: No, I'm waiting for my ASIC. Looking for calling card codes to call back to the states from Afghanistan. I have wanted to do this, the local farmer in my home town that does this had a waiting list and I never made it on. Perhaps to save on shipping you should teach the cow how to use GPS and just have him walk to the destination. That will guarantee a very lean cow.  I am currently using ZapTel calling cards which gets me calls from Afghanistan to the US for about 2 cents a minute.I am trying to move as much of my spending over to Bitcoins so would rather buy calling cards with Bitcoins. I have seen wireless cards for sale but not long distance cards. On another forum I am on there is a +rep/-rep (reputation) system.After a while, you get little green dots (kinda like the little bitcoins) for a lot of +rep that people give you. You get red dots as people give you -rep.Hazek knows what I am talking about.Also, this thread would be better off in this category: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=24.0 
Update:I got the web site files on my host.  http://www.bitpools.com/index.htmlThe 1 BTC was well worth giving me a jumping off point and the look is better than what I had spent a day or so working on myself that could be better spent on the back end stuff.Note, the BitPools site is very much in alpha stage at this point. Hmm, TIPS: To Insure(ensure) Prompt Service. Might as well go all in on Bitcoin. If it fails that means that the government won, and they will take care of you in your old age.God bless socialism. True, but having a good service that filters out or rates the bad files would be worth the BTC.Here in Afghanistan we get our stolen movies from the locals for about $2 each. People would pay for convenience. Bitcoins for stolen movies would probably win over Netflix for bitcoins. Someone else will probably jump in but the odds of it happening are to the point where you would need all of the time and energy in the universe for it to happen. Maybe slightly less if you are lucky. No daylight is saved from daylight savings time no matter what they say. I have done some drop shipping, here are some lessons learned.In all likelyhood, when it comes to manufacturing of mass quanities, just about everything comes from China. I am not saying that is a bad thing, just that you need to get used to the things that come along with that.I have drop shipped electronics and gadgets. The drop shipper I went with is well known enough to the point that when you put the item on ebay, you will see four or five other listings for the exact same thing using the exact same picture. And some people who have been doing the business longer will be able to offer cheaper prices than you can get because they have purchased more inventory and thus get VIP user discounts. When it comes to electronics, quality is important. I purchased one of the things I was selling to check it out and the quality was very poor. When you sell cheap Chinese electronics, do not expect to build up a good name for yourself and I have also heard about people who have gone through the pains of customers receiving broken pieces with little response from the manufacturer, you pretty much have to price in 1 out of 10 things breaking and giving a refund.Also, with things drop shipped from China you need to remember that it takes longer to get items to their destination. Figure in a little over a week if the item is already created and ready to go out the door.I have drop shipped high fashion boots as well. My wife knew the style of a certain boot that was very expensive and was very fashionable so when she found a Chinese knock-off, she ordered a pair for herself and I listed them for sale on ebay. The boots went for around $110 on the site, the real boots go for over $400 for originals, I charged $180-$200. There were a few other websites where you could get them for a similar price but it was not as prominent as the electronics. I would get one hit every couple of months on the boots. And with those you have to deal with crazy women, many of whom like to window shop and dream about buying them and want constant attention and different pictures and assurances that they will get the boots in the picture and all sorts of other insanity. And with the boots I had, they were not sitting in a warehouse waiting to be shipped out, they were made after you placed your order. So it took 3 weeks to a month from the time of order to delivery. That is 3 weeks of someone wanting updates and assurances that their boots are on their way.With my wife's store we also dealt in costume jewelry. There is a wide range of jewelry and prices so I cannot make a guess as to the quality of the OP. But the key we found to buying clothes and jewelry is to get a small order and check it out yourself. With jewelry it is pretty much, what you see is what you get, but I know that some of her jewelry would have little things fall off or the cheap metal would break, so it is good for wearing for a couple of weeks. She only had a few customers in her store that would bring the jewelry back after a week and demand an exchange. Shop around and you may find a decent company. For clothing, that is an art. My wife had it down as far as knowing which would be good quality and which would not (ie. something that would become see through, bad material, too small). Remember, the Chinese women are tiny. American women are, on average, larger.  She sold a lot of sun dresses because they can fit several sizes.And some companies have good quality of one product and poor quality of another. Finding the niche of the good items is the key.But drop shipping is easy when it comes to shipping things off. And I do wish I had found a company that took BTC. Tell him to wait.At least until I can buy more BTC. Give me a few more months at least.He should be ok with that right? No need to rush things. Just a quick note to say that OP does good work. He just finished my page and it looks better than I had envisioned in my mind.I will post a link to the page when I get home and can put the files on my server.He was able to do the front end, GUI, work while I am still working on the back end dynamic content portion of the page. He was able to do the creative visual stuff that I have neither the talent nor the experience to make work.  If we limit only libertarians to Bitcoin then we will not get very far.Following Ron Paul, he brought in many liberals and others who were against the Federal Reserve because they understood how bad the Fed actually is and what they are doing.Some people may believe that Bitcoin will make government programs more efficient so that we can have more government. Who knows.While libertarians can use Bitcoin as a tool to free ourselves from government control. It can also be used as a tool by many other ideological beliefs. Kim Jung Un could adopt Bitcoin for North Korea tomorrow and revel in dictatorial power as NK's GDP skyrockets and he uses the power to oppress his people even more and build a buttload of nukes. Ahh, gotcha.So, try to use many addresses so that the community will not come after you.I wonder how long it will take before we just split all of the large bitcoin wallets amongst ourselves. It will solve the hoarding thing. And those rich bastards do not really deserve it anyway.This is great fun. We are like the government of Bitcoin, passing down regulations when we do not like the way someone uses our system.Who should we go after next? I cannot wait to start banning more companies from using Bitcoin.Should we -really- be accepting transactions from Silk Road? They are giving us a bad rep.And what about a patch to stop BitPay from using Bitcoin. They are just exploiting the early weakness of Bitcoin being too difficult for merchants to implement as a payment service.This is great.  So I should be able to start CPU mining again and make some money? Yes, let us focus on Satoshi Dice and make them change their ways so that we can ignore this "flaw".Meanwhile, to drive the price down so someone can buy a bunch of BTC, they can flood the blockchain with tiny transactions and make it "bothersome" for miners.I am not a miner and have not been following them, but has there been some huge uproar from the miners saying that they are super bothered by all of the tiny transactions? There are ASIC machines coming out that can do 60 MH/s, are they going to be worthless because of so much "dust"?I have not seen a huge exodus of miners fed up with the amount of traffic. Anyone who has any sort of debt is essentially taking out a loan to buy BTC if you choose to buy bitcoins instead of paying down that debt. I agree with the many suggestions to go create your own alt coin and not to use Bitcoin.Do you often spend time on forums of technology that you do not wish to ever use to tell them why their technology is flawed?Does Litecoin have a forum? Have you critiqued them yet? I do not blame the guy for protecting his bottom line, which is people buying gold from him. Whether he has convinced himself that gold is the only option or he is purposefully ignoring everything else for his own gain is up to him. We all do similar things with all of the alt coins out there.  So if someone wants their 1 Satoshi they can just send it as a free transaction. Once it is of a sufficient age they will be sent.Problem solved. Maybe everyone should stop using Bitcoin to help out the miners at this early point of Bitcoin's evolution.We can start using it again once we have enough transactions where this problem will not exist.
Within libertarian groups I tend to see two types. The conspiracy, Alex Jones, the government is doing all sorts of bad things group. And the, government sucks and cannot do anything right group.The conspiracy group is anti government because they feel that the government is crafting all of these bad things on purpose and making our lives miserable for some reason or another.The other group knows that government is not so much about making things happen as it is about stealing your money with the promise that they will make things happen while being completely incompetent in the knowledge of how to do so.While on the other side you have the two groups that believe that the government is very competent and that if only they had the funding for whichever project, then they would make ice cream cakes fly from their fingertips for all the children of the world. And that all bad guys who do not like us would respect us the more we use the government to kill them. Such confidence in the CIA would imply that they have some stellar capabilities.My faith in the ability of any government agency to do something smart is near zero.And I work with/for such agencies...I see the incompetence daily. I wrote a quick little C++ program once to test the Martingale strategy in roulette though I did not know it was the Martingale method, just thought of it on my own.It came out as would be expected. It would do well for a while and then hit that odd streak of hitting all red or black many times in a row pushing my bet up over a million dollars before changing back to the other color.This lead me to the conclusion that it is like playing the anti-lottery. Where you bet millions of dollars in the hopes of winning a dollar. The odds are in your favor that you will win a dollar almost every time. But, just like the lottery, eventually the numbers could hit. And instead of winning a dollar you lose your millions.  You may want to see what he said most recently about Bitcoin:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150408.0"Its a fad and just because  people are accepting it today, something could happen, there could be a scandal. I dont know that I would feel comfortable if I took my life savings and converted it into bitcoins. Well see where it is in 10-20 years."He is still on the gold bug side of saying that the major flaw behind Bitcoin being that it is not backed by anything.I would tell him not to think of Bitcoin as an investment but a means of exchange. That Bitcoin is not meant to be something you put your life savings in and wait 10-20 years, it is useful for dropping your fiat dollars so that you can use it for simple transactions with no credit card fees.Tell him that many Bitcoin users hold gold for long term and Bitcoin for every day spending.His best interest is to let his listeners know that gold is the place to be because he owns a gold selling business. Play to his anti-fiat side as opposed to trying to push Bitcoin's "store of value".edit: I did not notice that the show had already started and that Tom Woods would be the host. Good luck  I sent an e-bay item to Brazil. The tracking showed "delivered" but the buyer claimed he never received it. He filed a claim with ebay and they refunded his money. I showed them the tracking number and that it showed "delivered" but that was not good enough for them, they said that they needed to see that it was delivered to the right person.So I started a whole process with the USPS to go through their international shipping and through all of that...in the end, there were way too many steps for me to go through and life got more important than spending my days on the phone. So the guy likely got some free stuff. Such is life. That was in 2011 dude...when miners were willing to mine for $50 block rewards.Before SatoshiDICE where transasction fees are paid to miners. I hope to go somewhere on vacation this summer and would like to be able to pay using BTC.Either a cruise or some sort of foreign travel. This is a good point. I like BitPay and it is great for a business but you have a great service that could be very useful for individuals.There are plenty of people that send and receive money on PayPal that are not businesses.Then again, I can see some legal gray area if you just start exchanging people's Bitcoins for local currencies. Because then you become an exchange and all the legal BS that goes along with it.As a payment service, it works well.I know I would transfer my BTC from MtGox to BitPay for the quick BTC to dollar turn around.  Sweet, I ran across some of your videos while studying for a few of my certs. Consider how a 100 million dollar sale would affect Bitcoin vs Microsoft.Microsoft currently has about 8 Billion shares at about $28/share.Bitcoin has about 11 million bitcoins at about $45/bitcoin.A 100 million dollar buy/sell for Microsoft would create a fluctuation in price of 10 cents.A 100 million dollar buy/sell for Bitcoin would create a fluctuation in price of $22.Now consider that only around 2% of the total amount of Bitcoins is traded daily (could be similar for Microsoft). The amount needed to fluctuate that much is closer to $2 million.(A quick check shows Microsoft up 16 cents for the day) MtGox is giving a good example of why patents and copyrights are not as necessary as one would think.Come out of the gate early, with a new idea that is useful and in demand and you will build a level of trust and a user base where you can dominate for a while.Is MtGox the best exchange out there? That is debateable. It is up to the other exchanges to provide something better and more useful to attract those customers who flock to MtGox. And it is up to MtGox to stay ahead of the curve.No monopoly can live without government interference. Other exchanges will start to grab more market share.Look at Internet Explorer. When I first started doing any web development, I had to conform to Internet Explorer's standards because 95% of web browser use was in IE. Now they are at less than 40%.With new technology there tend to be a limited amount of companies providing services. The same thing happened with the Internet and web pages. Pets.com jumped out of the gate as the place to go on the Internet for your pet needs. Now it is not so centralized. Nice...and your hosting services appear to be cheaper than namecheap. I am not in the service. They did give me dog tags the last time I came out here but not this time.Perhaps engraving the cross around my neck could work. And if someone stole it from me I could immediately rush to a computer and move my BTC.Though out here I would probably die from a missile or mortar round... You are welcome.Pay it forward. I sold about 500,000 BTC, it has not gone through yet. I just burned my house down in hopes that I can get money from the insurance company to pay the loan sharks that are going to take a leg for each week that I do not pay.PANIC PANIC PANIC!!! I was wondering about this myself. I am in Afghanistan and have to consider these things. pawned them for $3 to buy some bitcents Again, that is why I say that the risk is BitFinex itself. From what I understand it is run by a guy in France as a side job. While I have every bit of faith in his intentions and applaud his initiative, if everything tanks, he will likely not be able to cover anything overly huge.But yes, if I was someone who were holding on to dollars, a chunk of it would be in BitFinex getting a 100%+ return. This looks quite cool. It sounds like an innovative approach.
Well, the Fed prints out billions of dollars and gives it to their banker buddies before inflation hits. Then those buddies use that money for investments before inflation hits. Then as it trickles down to you and me the money is inflated.As for the way Bitcoin was created in order to award early adopters, it allowed people who may have otherwise just tried it out to have a large stake and incentive to make Bitcoin succeed. The risk was also higher early on to put in any time or money because it was an unproven technology.To go the opposite way of awarding latecomers and not awarding early adopters would have had people waiting to adopt Bitcoin until the incentive was there, which would have led to Bitcoins early demise. Methinks it was an article on Reason. Like the dollar? Google had the same problem early on. Its early adopters could have sold all of their shares at any point and dropped the price drastically. Very cool. Two of the main things I spend money on in the same week moving to Bitcoin.I e-mailed my mortgage broker to ask if they will take payments in bitcoin just for the trifecta. Edit: Response from my mortgage company. No Bitcoin support...darn. I was able to get on the site last night at home and saw that lending of dollars has over 100% annual return while Bitcoin lending yields 4%.Even if you do not like Bitcoin or want to play the market, getting a 100% return is a pretty decent place to keep your money.Though the risk factor is BitFinex itself at that point. Surely, if it were a bank with a track record, 100% returns on loans would be filled quickly. How much does it cost to produce a single Bitcoin. Then what is the cost of distribution and then the cost of retail. 2 and 3 would require that several people who have "no" connection whatsoever who are trusted members of the community, well known by several respected people, including one who is a stickler for security, all conspiring together to pull this off. To try to state that it is a scam is to be labeled a tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist. Niice Hence the reason behind creating several virtual personas. reserved for "I told you so"  Bitcoin will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants; bitcoin will not give him a code of values, if he's evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if he's evaded the choice of what to seek. Bitcoin will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his bitcoin replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his bitcoin.Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth  the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his bitcoin, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that bitcoin corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his bitcoin? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Bitcoin is a living power that dies without its root. Bitcoin will not serve that mind that cannot match it.When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns  or bitcoins. Take your choice  there is no other  and your time is running out. At this point, most of us realize that the actual Bitcoin network will not get hacked and our public/private keys are a safe way of holding value.But I could see a social engineering attack focussed on this by those who would want to bring it down.Let us say that the Fed or the US-gov or some in power want to bring down Bitcoin. Considering the Fed is dumping tens of billions of dollars into the economy a month, a few million dollars to take down Bitcoin would be a drop in the bucket.A single agent with a few million dollars would be all they would need. The agent would work to build trust among key members of the Bitcoin community, using his accumulating Bitcoin wallet to get his hands in a few things. He would create several virtual personas which would also try to build trust. His outward approach would be that of security, focussing on ensuring people that Bitcoin is secure and that he is all about making sure his wallet is uber secure. He would go to Bitcoin conferences, make sure to be friendly to people and invest in various projects so that anyone questioning him will be met with a "I met him, he's a really good guy. I trust him.". All about building trust and making it known that he has a secure public address which he flaunts, showing people the amount in his vanity address, tieing it to himself.Then comes the "attack". Having built up a large amount of BTC in his well known public address, he all of the sudden gets "attacked". All of his bitcoins are taken by a "hacker" and moved to a dummy address with something hackerish like "HACKEDBITCOINS1337LOLZ...". He assures people that there is no way anyone had his private address, he created the vanity address on an offline machine, then burned the machine and put it in a vat of acid then kept the only written copy in a finger print secured safe which was then put into a safe deposit box which has not been tampered with. He claims that this has to be a hack on Bitcoin itself. Then he starts pulling out his other virtual personas who have similar attacks happening. All BTC being sent to the same dead address. At the same time, he uses the money he has built up in BTC to dump bitcoins fast and hard plunging the price a good percentage which sends people into panic mode dumping their BTC. Everything is put into depicting the myth that Bitcoin itself can be hacked and that the vulnerability is unknown and nobody can stop it. A few more "people" continue to claim lost coins, more coins going to the dummy address. Bitcoin becomes considered unsafe as a store of value and with the vulnerability unknown, it is considered an inherent flaw in the whole p2p currency concept.A few hold outs are skeptical, calling to question various things and still not believing it. They are considered conspiracy theorists and quacks. People move on to trying to figure out a way to make gold more like Bitcoin or just start encouraging people to use gold instead saying that they knew all along that gold was a better choice. Any time someone brings up a p2p encrypted currency concept from there on out, Bitcoin is used as an example of why they should not do it.I just put this out there as a warning. Just to make people aware if something similar happens, that everything may not be as it seems. We are, after all, going up against something that holds a lot of power. Power is not ceded easily. We will reach the point where a small nation could potentially have an annual GDP of 10-100 BTC.21 million will be plenty. Half of that will be plenty. Pirate's scam took us from around $12-$13 to around $8-$9 for a short bit. Tom Skerritt could not have said it better. OP, I did something similar to what you are planning.In early July 2011 I took $10,000 out of my 401k to buy bitcoins at a mere $14.5/BTC. I had confidence in the whole Bitcoin technology and everything that it stood for.I watched as my investment dropped. I was able to make a few more bitcoin buying and selling on MtGox getting my total Bitcoin stash over 750. Then I learned about Bitcoinica which allowed you to trade on a 10:1 margin as well as allowing shorting. So I moved about 600 of my BTC over to Bitcoinica and started trading at a 10:1 margin. Almost every time I dumped a large trade in the market went the opposite direction and I lost my leveraged funds. After becoming suspicious with only about 150 BTC remaining I moved it back to MtGox and then into a private address for safe keeping. At this point the price was around $4/BTC, basically a value of around $1,000 remaining.I had a reason for jumping in with my 401k. I had a $30,000 balloon payment on the lot of land next to my house due that next April. I figured that BTC would triple by then at least. Instead I was short, I had to cash out more from my 401k while I had to pay $3k in penalties and taxes on the original withdrawal.Along with other factors, I took out so much from my 401k that I owe the IRS a lot of money this year. And the only way I could do that is to work in Afghanistan where I get paid very well. Now my life is hell.Bitcoin was not the only reason, my wife and I made some poor financial choices including a failed business. But just tread carefully. You are young and you should be ok with just $6k.But you have been warned enough so I will address your original question:If you have a credit card with a decent limit, a good way to get BTC for credit is to sell something in demand at cost on BitMit and have it shipped to the buyer while paying for it with your card. There are some wholesale companies out there that allow drop shipping, if you find a decent one you could even make a few bitcents. OP, please put a link to http://www.namecheap.com in your post so that those wanting to switch over can connect from here. That will show them the large amount of traffic they are getting from switching over to Bitcoin.I will be moving all of my domains over from godaddy and hostmonster.I cannot access their site at work, how is their hosting service? Do they allow java and JVM? I was about to sign up for rimuhosting.com which allows this with shell access but I asked them if they supported payments with Bitcoin and they said "We do not have any plans to accept bitcoin as payment method at the moment.". The more things that I usually pay for with $ that now accept BTC the better.  Since I cannot view it at work I was going to check it out at home. From the reading I did on here I like the idea of being able to loan BTC and trade on margin.But I do tread carefully as I was burned by Bitcoinica. Though I was fortunate to get most of my BTC out a few weeks before it went away. And I had a sinking suspicion that those running Bitcoinica were behind the "manipulator" factor (the few large trades I did on a 10:1 margin were swung in the complete opposite direction just enough to kick me off my limit before swinging back to where the market was pushing). Looks pretty decent. I will definitely check it out when I get home.
When I was doing the estimating it was 6% traded on Gox about a year ago.This is the reason that the price can move so quickly one way or the other. This "small" volume compared to all Bitcoins determines the dollar value.You do not need to invest $1 per actual Bitcoin for the value to go up $1 in price. When Bitcoinica opened its doors, $/BTC was at $8. Within a few months and with more adoption of its use the price plunged to $2/BTC. The price leveled out at around $4-5 before Bitcoinica died.There are a lot of people who want to make a profit with Bitcoin and are currently doing so by buying and holding. But would another shorting site like Bitcoinica produce a drop in price as people try to profit from the price going down? I believe Bitcoin should be useful for people of all sexual preferences. I own things because I have them in my possession. I possess things, which is to own them.If I possess(own) an apple in my pocket. Then your "From" would require that it is taken from me. If I did not possess such a thing, then there would be no reason to take it and there would be no reason for the "From", it would just simply be possessed by the person who needs it and require neither "From" nor "to". The person who needs it would magically be nourished by the apple in my pocket.Taking "From" and giving "to" requires ownership so obviously Marx believed things are owned. Otherwise the statement would be "Created by each according to his ability. Consumed by each according to his needs." We will be the new elites.Then what will happen? Some crazy alien shit. The 21 Million myth has been completely blown away by the OP.If one Satoshi is worth $1 million each. Then you can trade the value of that Satoshi in dollars now and leave Bitcoin behind.And as long as they can keep printing dollars, then Bitcoin will last forever!!!Awesome. There is a private investigator on this forum that provides his services for a decent BTC price that has had some decent feedback.What is your full name? US coins are  illegal to melt.No our politicians are not bought and paid for. I was wondering if there is a website or a way to sell some information for BTC anonymously.I have a friend who had a DUI and there are some common legal misconceptions relating to the penalties that I was able to get past with a bit of research. And most likely people in such a situation would be willing to pay a few bucks for said information.I would like to post the documents and stuff I was able to put together but would rather not have to go through any gray areas of providing legal advice or have pissed off people who have more to gain by keeping the myths in place focussing any attention on me. The price where it is now is bitter sweet. Sweet in that I like to watch the value of my current BTC rise.Bitter in that I want to buy more...but want to buy at a lower price. No phones allowed...but going down a rabbit hole of how I could send Bitcoins at my work would be useless with the restrictions. If I really have to send BTC while at work I can go outside and send it via smartphone.I am supposed to only be doing work at work anyway, which I always follow  Then why does it need to come "From" anyone? And how can you give anything "to" anyone? I saw that purple down arrow and sold all of my bitcoins. Going long on fiat.Thank you for this analysis. My main problem from your quote is how this part is done. Create a Bittorrent porn clip and put the site name on the chick's boobs for the money shot. I am working on a website and while the idea of handing off the authorization portion to a third party seems tempting I can think of two things that would hold me back.One, I am giving away a portion of my site's security to a third party with only the hope that they will not abuse it. I may as well have all BTC transactions handled by MtGox and content controlled by Wikipedia. While I do not believe Google's business model would last if they abused the access of websites, I still do not like the idea of handing such control over to someone else.Second, as a user I tend to avoid sites or apps that require access to my Facebook or other accounts. I may trust Facebook or Google to keep my information secure and private but I do not trust XYZ site to use that information the way I originally intended.I may consider giving users options of security. With the highest security being the use of their private key to sign something for each login and perhaps the lowest being a Google or other third party auth. I could see this for people at work wanting to send come BTC. My work filter blocks about 80% of Bitcoin sites including blockchain.org. And I cannot install anything on my PC without going through my sys admin. The only fair system of voting is one where 100% of people agree on where their money is spent.Otherwise you need systems for robbing people and the tyrannical side of government grows from there. Bitcoin is a small market. A single large investor can swing the price one way or another rather easily.The small amount of the market that is traded on the exchanges is what sets the price. And that is a small percentage of the $400million BTC economy. My technical analysis is never wrong. Here is another:_/\_----^_/Buy or sell based upon that and you are all set for big money.
I am deployed to Afghanistan and people here use Amazon almost exclusively. I believe because the shipping is free and gets here in one or two weeks.Does BitcoinStore send to APOs? And how would the shipping be? I work with a lot of geeks with expendable money. The rally ended at 33.2 followed by a huge crash to $33.Run for the exits, the end is near. Getting a third mortgage based upon this information. Thank you. this I have one of these. I was considering using it for creating addresses.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackDogIt has fingerprint protection for access. Forever is a long time. You can grab the private key for any of the addresses before then. Ok, so MtGox has proven itself to be fairly secure with our funds since June 2011.And now a company is buying the US accounts to help secure them and this is supposed to be an advance? I would like to get there. It is harder for people at this point than it was for others already there. I went to a bar once where they had an ATM there and they would only accept cash (no cards). So when you went to pay your bill you would go to the ATM and get cash, then give it to the bartender. I assume it was because the bar did not want to claim all of the money they made at the bar.I have also owned a bar and would not really see the point in cash paying customers converting their cash to bitcoins. It would be of little benefit to me as a bar owner other than the novelty factor of getting a few geeks to come in and try it out to promote Bitcoin.What would make this ideal would be an actual ATM that accepted ATM/debit cards which would then convert it to Bitcoin (if necessary for legal reasons it could spit out cash to then be fed into the cash to bitcoin portion. That way you could say that you charge 3% for cards but take bitcoins for no extra charge. They would then have the incentive to want to save 3% and go through the process to get the BTC. This is actually a very good idea. Perhaps just have a central site which can plug into an API on the various sites with their rating systems for those that are currently using them, then a pluggable API for sites that do not want to use their own system.So you could have a central location that would have something like:bitcointalk.orgElwar: *** (2414 posts)BTCJamElwar100: 95%BitMitMagnoliaBoutiq: 2+XYZsiteE1war: XXXXX Stability actually fuels the rocket. It should go without saying that we will all be complying with all local laws and taxing enforcement.I think I speak for everyone in the community in saying that Bitcoin will not be used for tax evasion purposes.I think they would all also agree that our government watchdogs that may read this forum are to be considered heros, perhaps on the level of gods if I may be so bold. I will certainly move all of my domains to namecheap if they accept Bitcoins. The fact that there are so many people hoping for a downturn or a bubble burst so that they can buy Bitcoin cheaper means that there would not be a very big downturn.When the price went down to $4/BTC a lot of it was from people making money on Bitcoinica shorting to make money. At that point, people were hoping the price would go up so that they could short more. Plus there were so many hacks that sentiment was not very healthy on Bitcoin making it at all.I would expect lower prices if shorting were popular again. But Bitcoin has also proven itself fairly well in the past 6 months or so. So Bitcoin is prone to crashes!?!? Several in one month!!!That is worse than the stock market. Time to dump Bitcoins and buy into something that does not crash. What happen?  My casual observation has been that when the stock market is way down, the Bitcoin price is also down.I do not think it is an either or type of thing. If people have money for stocks they have money for bitcoins. Most likely scenario.That is why I will only buy back in when I am paid at least $1 per BTC. Buy and use bitcoins to for any purchases is the best strategy.
The correction from its fall from $31.90 I am willing to pay 10% interest on a loan toward the future value of one of my $100m bitcoins.First come first served. If the government has deemed raw milk is bad for you and has thus done the honorable thing and protected us from such a danger, then why question it?We should be coming up with ways to use Bitcoin to reward politicians who pass more laws to protect us from ourselves. So Bitcoins are a good investment at $5 but not at $27? What makes them good at $5?Even if it were true that it is only good for gambling and drugs, the worldwide drug trade has a yearly revenue of over $300 billion. Even if all Bitcoins were distributed and Bitcoins were used in only 1% of the drug trade, Bitcoin would need to be worth over $100/BTC just for that small sliver of commerce.When did you buy in? Was it at $5? Or did you buy in high according to your valuation of Bitcoin? Most people are not sitting on buttloads of cash.When a majority of Americans are deep in debt and live paycheck to paycheck, selling for some reason or another is inevitable.Especially in a recession. Nice. I will try first before showing her. sweet Just checked my charge again. $37.30 to be exact.But 7% would make sense in that our sales tax is 7%.So by taking cash they have no paper trail. With a credit card they eat the CC fee and charge you sales tax.I have noticed a few more gas stations charging based upon credit card or cash. I went Kayaking the other day and rented a kayak. The charge was $35. But they said "if you're going to use a credit card we charge extra". I used my credit card and they charged $37.50. I could care less if other people use Bitcoin. They will eventually, it is just a matter of when will the technology make it as simple as paypal to switch over. Until then, I am content in buying Bitcoin cheap while it still takes a bit of effort to get set up initially.But I care about my family and want them to benefit as well. If I can show my mom how to get Bitcoin so that after that initial transaction she knows how to easily transfer money from her bank account, then she will be able to do so at her leisure from then on and enjoy the benefits that come along with it.She used to not understand text messaging on her cell phone (she called it a "tex mex"). Now she is on her iPhone almost constantly. Well, actually I was just going to drop it off at CarMax and get a check but she wanted it. I told her she could just have it but she insists on paying for it.  Apparently a currency is only worth something if you can buy food with it. USD just lost 20% of its value in the past week.btw...welcome to the forums, enjoy learning about Bitcoins Not when the closest branch for my bank is hundreds of miles away from where she lives. Keeping cash reserves in a currency losing value to buy that pizza just cost you double the cost of the pizza. http://pizzaforcoins.com Ok, it is not all that spectacular since I am selling my truck to my mother but...I told her that if she is going to buy it she has to pay me in bitcoins. This is mainly to help her learn how to convert her dollars to bitcoins to help her get her feet wet.Plus the usefulness of Bitcoin comes into play here. I will be out of the country with no access to a bank. She cannot send me a check. She would have to either go to my bank and deposit into my account or attempt some sort of wire transfer or come up with some other difficult way to pay me (or expensive using PayPal). You could run the full economy of a small country with a couple hundred BTC.People hoarding would have no affect on your ability to make a purchase using Bitcoin. Blogspot is ranked higher than Wordpress on Alexa.
Gold is so old school...Manganese is the new commodity. Get it now while you still can. Great job guys.I will certainly try this the next time I need to fill my Etisalat phone with minutes. Oh Fudge. I did notice that there was delivery to armed forces in different parts of the world but was wondering if that meant it sends to APO addresses. Well, it looks like it went way up.It is February, I just bought $3k worth and am waiting on Dwolla for another $2k.As per my luck, a crash after I purchase it over $25. This is quite cool.Well done. Yifu Guo is the greatest American Hero. A great reward for the first few out there but that return will drop once that single machine is multiplied by hundreds/thousands.Awesome stuff though. I had someone purchase a pair of boots from me on BitMit when the price was $14/BTC.I failed to mention in my ad that these particular boots usually take about 3 weeks to arrive (on e-bay I can list the estimated shipping and processing time).Of course this person was not pleased when the boots did not arrive after a week or so and the price had jumped so high.As I failed to mention the long wait time in the ad I have told him that he will be re-imbursed the difference in price between when he made the purchase and when he receives the boots.Though on the other end, I recall a friend who went to another country for vacation where there was high inflation. They would charge extra for credit card purchases because by the time the card company paid them, the value would be down by too much.I did read an article stating that when different currencies are exchanged, people tend to want to keep the more valueable and will give away the less valueable currency. Like getting dollars and giving local currency as change. If the choice is between giving away dollars or bitcoins, giving away dollars will be the likely result. Would there be any demand for a bitcoin splitting service?By a splitting service I mean, you send X amount to one address and it gets split to different percentages to W Y and Z.An example use I can think of is a small business owner who has a weekly budget with a few employees in one division or set of employees, they sendthe weekly payment to a single address and each person gets their set percentage. Like a bar owner pays 20BTC to the waitresses each week. They have 5 waitresses, 2 get paid 25% each, 2 get paid 20% each, 1 gets paid 10%, the owner sends 20BTC to the "waitress address" and each waitress gets her allotted payment. Arggh...posted a long post and lost it.Basically it would mainly be up to the title agency (lawyer)/government representative. They would have to verify the purchase.Foreign purchase would be helped by not needing to convert your currency and get a paper check. The question is...how much would Bitcoin turn that evil government to good? I second the suggestion of calling a denomination of Bitcoin a scat.We have discussed the fractions many times, I believe consensus has been fairly reached in different polls. My wife's store used to give a 5% discount for cash.We looked up our CC agreements and it said we could not charge extra for using cards.American Express charges the most, if we could have charged more for Amex we would have.People were usually willing to pull out cash when we told them about the discount. I memorize each letter and number and associate it with something I can remember.taking a few numbers from my private address: 8Sp57Athat subset I remember that when I was 8 years old I broke my arm, the 'S' I think about Superman, the 'p' stands for taking a piss, 57 for 57 Chevy that my dad rebuilt, the A is for Al's restaurant on Happy Days...just a simple way of remembering it all no problem  Good overview. The bigger Bitcoin grows, the more people will know only a sliver of what it has to offer. I hid the following in the blockchain:80085you are all transporting porn now Bitfloor allows for ING P2P as well as direct deposit into several major banks. I guess I do not think of it as e-money, just as money. So e-cash is just as odd to me. I started working on a system where your login is tied to a Bitcoin address for verification.You provide an empty address and you are not authenticated until there are BTC in the address.It still requires a login and password. I could not figure out a good way to use BTC for that.
There are other ways to get dollars for Bitcoins.Why all the fuss over one exchange to get your cash? With the large amount of Chinese characters are Bitcoin addresses a lot shorter or do they just write them using our letters and numbers? $31.5 As much as I know about Bitcoin I would have never gotten that answer.For the amount of spaces they had I would have guessed MONEY I have been tatooing the blockchain on my ass so if we ever get hit by an EMP we're good. Just find me and I'll let you know how many BTC you have. The last time the price was in this range it would go haywire whenever the price hit $20.Stable stable stable...$20...rollercoaster ride...stable stable stable...$20...insanity It is used in many illegal things for a reason. And the more things become illegal, the more illegal things will be using Bitcoin.Imagine the extreme scenario. A 1984 type of environment or jews under Hitler's Germany. Imagine trying to buy a bible or a book that is not authorized by the dictatorship. Or imagine trying to buy a loaf of bread beyond what you are allowed to buy even though your family is starving because of rationing. You would not use a credit card or use your bank account for such a thing. The regime would be able to track your purchase and punish you. The best way to do so would be to use Bitcoins. You could do so anonymously and not be tracked by the oppressive government.As it is now, there are only a few things that the regime has deemed illegal to purchase such as drugs and gambling. Same thing, you use Bitcoins because you cannot be traced. They have an advantage in that aspect beyond all other payment systems. As governments become more oppressive, Bitcoin will fill that role. There is an advantage to using it for such things and thus the market is responding. Once there is a large enough advantage to using Bitcoins in our day to day purchases, it will fill that role. Here is an idea that I just thought of.Start an investment in Bitcoins where you promise to pay people a certain percent each week say 5-10%. As people start investing, just use those new investments to pay people that 5-10%. Eventually it will become popular as so many people are getting such a steady and good return on their investment. The money will keep flowing in more and more and you will get more and more Bitcoins.Many people will be happy and you will be rich.Or another idea on how to get a lot of Bitcoins would be to get a large boat and sail it on the high seas and attack other boats, board them and steal all of their Bitcoins as you go port to port and have adventures and swashbuckling. No mention of bitcoin because it is all in jibberish. Just people I could think of off the top of my who had an idea or principles that were attacked not on the beliefs but on the person's character. Most Daily Paul folks are very gold bug oriented so their hostility toward Bitcoins comes from that angle as opposed to those who see the dollar as a valid currency.Getting past the "I want something I can hold in my hand" mentality is a big hurdle.The best approach for that is the fact that if the government gets so bad that you have to jump ship, they are likely searching your bags on your way out taking any gold you may have on you. But with Bitcoin you can just memorize your key or put it on a piece of paper and you are all set.Then the "what if there is no electricity" crowd pokes their heads in... Pirate lol...oops So Bitfloor still takes ING p2p deposits? I was on their site and could not find it.I am currently at work so I cannot access the page but could someone show me where I go to do this? In the future kids will be too busy flying cars and eating space cheese to worry about breaking an encryption algorithm. I always answer 'ahoy' as Graham Bell wanted.Do not deviate from the proper phone answering words! A 1,000 increase  in the value of a "shave and a haircut" (with regard to the dollar). A shave and a hair cut used to cost 2 bits ($.25).Now you could get the same for $25.00.That is a 1,000 times increase.1 BTC is currently $14/BTC.Why is it unreasonable that it too could not have a 1,000 times increase?You focus too much on the value of 1BTC.They could have just as easily called 100BTC "one bitcoin". or .001 "one bitcoin".In your scenario of the richest man buying all of the Bitcoin of the world...What would happen if Bill Gates advertised that he was buying all of the Bitcoin of the world? Would you sell your 1 Bitcoin to him for $14/BTC or would you hold out for more? How much would you sell it for if he had all Bitcoin except for your 1 BTC? Would you still only take $14? Or would a couple of million dollars be worth it? It would be easy to pay the $30/year subscription for meetups that are losing their subscriptions. You get an instant e-mail list of a bunch of liberty supporting folks.I am a member of my local Ron Paul meetup. They mainly just send out e-mails now about every other thing that the government is doing wrong. I believe that Satoshi staying anonymous is the best thing for Bitcoin and likely best for Satoshi.Sometimes when someone has a great idea and you cannot beat the idea, it is easier to attack the character of the person who had the idea."You use Bitcoin? You do know that the creator is a huge racist/homophobe/anti-semite/pervert/<insert your slander here> don't you?"MLK - womanizerMohammad - pedophileRon Paul - racistThomas Jefferson - slave owneretc...
Casascius came up with the concept of creating a holographic sticker that could have the private key imprinted on it and the coin holder would need to strip off the sticker in order to retrieve the actual bitcoin value.It is not like he just stamped out a bunch of brass coins and sold them as "physical bitcoins".And it was not really a business venture meant to me hugely profitable, more as a way to help bitcoin in general. He's on a lot of things related to bitcoin because he is involved in many things. 1: Knock Knock2: Who's there?1: CP2: CP who?1: You'll never be able to mine Bitcoins that way! If ASICs are being sold at a pace by 2015 where every Bitcoin miner is using them, then the ASIC companies will have enough money to re-tool the mining rigs and start selling upgraded versions a lot faster than they are now. They will have vetted out most of their processes by then and have staff to push it through. A fun read for the children:The adventures of Johnathan Gulliblehttp://www.bastiatinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/jonathangulliblecomm.pdf I do not have my cell phone with me but I had two that I checked constantly.One was a Bitcoin price app and another had Bitcoin news. Basically an rss feed from somewhere. Capitalism.I do not entirely agree on this point though I understand your description.Capitalism - an economic system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations, especially as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth. I do not see Bitcoin as an ecnomic system. Bitcoin is more accurately, capital itself. Also when considering mining pools where many individuals cooperatively produce wealth it goes against the definition. Bitcoins could just as easily be used by a communist country that forces people to pay Bitcoin in order to stay out of jail.You could change it to just say "property: that which a person owns; the possession or possessions of a particular owner". Bitcoin could just as easily become public property as it is private property. GUESS: $30A repeat of June 2011 will occur with the repeated crash after a one day spike. Is it pure  Bitcoin or is it mixed in with other currencies? Imagine a program that uses processor cycles and pays people for the use of those cycles in Bitcoins. It does not pay each of its users in Bitcoin every time but it creates a sort of "lottery" ever few minutes of who will get the Bitcoin and those who provide the most processor cycles is the most likely to win this "lottery".With such a system, more and more people will be willing to put their processing power toward winning this lottery and thus expanding the processing power of this program. As Bitcoins become more valuable more and more people will start putting more and more processing power toward running this program.It will then reach a point where it overtakes all other computer programs in processing power growing continuously larger by the day.The name of this program?Bitcoin. Half go to the miners. Half go to Satoshi. This was his plan all along. We all fell for it! I had a Palm Pre that had a linux OS running on it. That was several years ago. How is another linux phone a big advance? The latin translation for fiat  is: "Let it be done." It is the present subjunctive of "facere" -- to do. That it why it was used to mean an order or decree in former times.But it does not necessarily have to require government to decree that "it be done".When a new block is solved and 25 BTC are distributed, you could say that the Bitcoin protocol itself is saying "let it be done". Thus issuing currency via fiat.The question is, are people willing to accept the decree of a protocol of equations and numbers as opposed to by government decree.Then there is the idea that all 21 million BTC have already been created, they just have not yet been distributed. $12.75 So what stops someone from putting out such an offer and then not paying the cash?It still comes down to the trust factor.I am interested if you come up with an escrow function.I do see this as something that would be good to have several Bitcoin escrow companies that compete and provide the trust needed. SELL SELL SELL!!! Umm...Wichita Kansas is to Bitcoin what Silicon Valley is to the computer industry.Buy property there quick because it will all soon cost a lot of BTC! Ya but...what happened with the bill? I know Bitfloor used to allow a free deposit of cash into their bank account but I do not see it on their website anymore. Banks are holding those homes because selling them will result in a loss on their books.If the bank has a loan on a house valued at 300k and the owner forecloses, their books show that they now have a 300k asset.With the drop in the market that house may now be valued at 100k or less.If banks dropped all of their foreclosure homes, their earnings reports would show huge losses and scare off investors making their stocks plunge. So keeping the properties at their inflated value is to their advantage even if the house crumbles into a heap of wood.It is a flaw of only appraising a home's value at the time of purchase. If there were yearly appraisals these homes would be dumped left and right. I would have done worse than him before my 6 months in Toastmasters where I learned how to speak in front of crowds and they taught me to not use "um", "ahh", "you know", etc...But I would still likely be nervous in front of an audience trying to explain everything there is about Bitcoin. I have seen some great speakers speak on all aspects of the technology from the economic perspective to the technological. I would have had a hard time describing the blockchain portion of it up until a few months ago after diving into the code of it, and I would still only be able to give a general idea of it with difficulty if someone wanted more detail on the cryptology portion of it.But in all actuality, I could easily consider myself a "Bitcoin expert" in front of a group of people who have heard nothing about it and want to learn about it.Face it, most of us are geeks that have some good knowledge but are not comfortable in the area of communicating. Especially in front of a large audience that ended up being somewhat hostile toward the end.If I were to do something like that I would have a speech prepared and limit the questions and say "we can discuss that further afterwards" often.
What would bring Bitcoin to your grandpa, dad or the kid with the ice cream would be a debit card that can instantly convert your Bitcoin account to the local currency.And if that same card can be fueled by direct deposit of your grandpa's SS check which is then converted to Bitcoin until he needs to spend it. AWESOME!!!so...um, what does this mean? Quite cool. I will definitely use this. The price will drop back down under $4 when people cash out to buy Christmas presents like last year. I much prefer keeping my private key written down than backing up my wallet.I found it difficult to import my private key when I needed to spend money from that address. I could only do it from the command line and only had access to my phone and tablet at the time. I had to install the client and download the blockchain to my work computer which took a while.I wish there was a way to import on the Bitcoin App. Best time to buy is when you start to see questions such as "is this the end of Bitcoin?" Mon dieux!  About Payward, Inc.Well-funded, experienced team with prior successful startups/exits under our belt, highly security-conscious, out to save the world.  Just four guys now but we've been at it for the last 16 months, and getting close to launch.  Services include an exchange/market (FOREX) for arbitrary currencies, including Bitcoin and Ripple, an ewallet and merchant services for arbitrary currencies, including Bitcoin and Ripple. So it gives the private key. Is there a web service for uploading the private key to use the BTC?I am thinking about giving out some of these for Christmas. Bitcoins are also not a bit. There has been discussion here about this. password is BBBBB or BBBBTCon an android tablet or I would try it myself It would be quite nice to be able to go to a travel website and pay for a full vacation in Bitcoin. They could even give you a voucher for several restaurants while you are there.Maybe even a vacation to some place like Berlin and highlight all of the places you can go and only spend Bitcoin. Easy way for an MMORPG to make money using BTC: Sell computer generated missiles to users for BTC. User uses the missile to blow something up. Sell more missiles and more things that just got blown up.Rinse, repeat. Awesome!I sent an e-mail to PayPal asking them to start accepting Bitcoin and their response was:Thank you for contacting PayPal.In response to your query we thank you for your input and will pass along your message about Accept Bitcoins Beotchez!! to our development department.Remaining at your disposal for any further assistance.Please note that if you have any further queries relating to this request you will have to submit another request via our web form.Yours sincerely, Michael Congrats.I love Dark Side of the Moon. Happy Halving Day!!! Not a bad prediction for halving day price of $12.30 I heard that due to the shift in the electromagnetic pull from the halving of the blockchain reward you can actually stand an egg on its end.We should all do that and gaze in wonder at the power of physics and electricity! bump
 Strippers can get in the game by tattooing a QR code on their ass for the BTC love...same with prostitutes... Mine are the first bits. I would like to be able to pay bills in Bitcoin.It is my hope that I can eventually just have all of my $ paychecks converted to BTC and shift my money to different "accounts" to be spent in different ways as a way of budgeting.If you could integrate some simple budgeting software it would be excellent. I hope this whole Ponzi thing goes away so that people will be more likely to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon and I can make money.Then jump out of the market before it all crashes. I was thinking about giving Bitcoins out for Christmas to my family in a way that is as easy for them to spend or keep as possible.What would be the best way? Those who believe that Rand Paul is more socially conservative than Romney or just about any sitting Republican are quite ill informed.He is likely more socially liberal than most Democrats. They are hitting those who they believe would understand the steps to go ahead and get a large amount of BTC.They went after Bit-Pay and BitInstant. They will go after you if you advertise having a lot of BTC. <rss version="2.0"><channel><generator>NFE/1.0</generator><title>Bitcoin News</title><link>http://news.google.com/news?gl=us&pz=1&ned=us&hl=en&q=site:http://news.ycombinator.com/+bitcoin</link><language>en</language><webMaster>news-feedback@google.com</webMaster><copyright>&copy;2012 Google</copyright><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2012 21:33:42 GMT</pubDate><lastBuildDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2012 21:33:42 GMT</lastBuildDate><image><title>site:http://news.ycombinator.com/ bitcoin - Google News</title><url>https://ssl.gstatic.com/news/img/logo/en_us/news.gif</url><link>http://news.google.com/news?gl=us&pz=1&ned=us&hl=en&q=site:http://news.ycombinator.com/+bitcoin</link></image><description>Google News</description></channel></rss> I was looking through Freelancer (http://www.freelancer.com/) and they have a ton of jobs.Perhaps someone could create a site where you take the listings from freelancer and post them and display how much you will pay in BTC for the job. Then you submit the job on freelancer with the equivalent dollar price. Once it is complete, you pay the Bitcoin person in BTC minus your cut.Some vetting and performance measures would be needed for new people applying for projects but using a single company name on freelancer would give more credibility towards the bids. I believe that it is good to get the word out there on things you are working on. If you bring something up and someone else is already working on it or finished with it, then you need to decide if your solution is better/different or can compete.It is also good to get a feel for enthusiasm behind projects and gauge what type of user base you may have once it is released. This could impact how much work you put into it. Of if there is no interest, perhaps put more effort into something that will get more use.Keep up the good work. Sorry to hear this. I was just going to the page to check on the status of the Bitcoin card.  I tried to go to the BitInstant website and got:Website currently unavailableThe website you are trying to access is currently unavailable. Please try again at a later time.If you are the site owner, here is a help resource to help resolve the issueby CloudFlare, their DDoS checker... You also have to incorporate 1337 into something.You have failed at your first hacker attempt.Unlike me who is 1337.see how it is done? That is what I have always thought as well. But with the amount of absentee ballots being used, they are under the same position. The NRA is a club for hunters.The Gun Owners of America actually work to protect our 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.GOA rated Mitt Romney with a D-GOA rated Barack Obama with an F The interesting thing about Colorado is that the establishments selling the MJ will be state government facilities.So the Feds would literally be attacking the states.This should be interesting.On the conservative side, do you defend states rights and say that those dispensaries should be able to sell pot?On the liberal side, do you defend statism and say that the Federal government should be able to shut those shops down? The part about "Some of them are wrong, some are misleading"All issues listed are true for both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. Which are wrong or misleading? Nah, I just threw that in there describing Mitt Romney's stances to piss off all of those Republicans who voted for him.(many Republicans do not know that he passed same sex marriage when he was governor by executive fiat) Begins today.http://www.facebook.com/RandPaulJustinAmash2016
Anyone who prepares for zombies with guns is not only a threat to themselves but a threat to me as well.Everyone knows that you have to cut a zombie's head off, so by shooting them and them staying alive to end up biting you and turning you into a zombie only adds to my effort in cutting off heads.So please, buy a machete or an axe. Save us both the hassle. I agree. Grouping ourselves based upon melanin is idiotic. I see it done on both sides. I did.I wrote in Ron Paul. So you are saying that there is a place where all of the US liberals could go to obtain their utopias instead of transforming this country? (not that there is much left to transform, our Constitution is TP). For Romney or Obama? The original social attack against marijuana came because Mexican workers would bring their strange plant with them from south of the border and with it being common among them and uncommon among Americans it was used as a way to attack Mexicans without outwardly attacking them.Then in the 60s hippy generation Richard Nixon was doing everything he could do to prevent those "damned hippies" from holding their protests. He kept running into 1st Amendment issues and could not stop them.Then he realized that marijuana was very popular among hippies and was an integral part of their protests. So he attacked and outlawed marijuana in the hopes of being able to send in police to break up these hippy gatherings.And the rest was history. Way to go America. You just elected a guy who:Passed socialized health care forcing people to get insurance at the point of a gun.Top financial supporters were Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, and supported the bank bailout.Increased spending while in office.Supports the war in Afghanistan.Supports same sex marriageIs anti-gun rights.Supports the NDAA (allows military to arrest US citizens without a warrant, trial or lawyer) also allows Internet censorshipOpposed Bush's tax cuts.Supported "Cap and Tax" as a way to fight global warming.-----------------Please change that first line to "re-elected" if Obama wins.  There was a better challenger to Obama...that would have been Ron Paul and the rest of the world would have been even more pleased with him as he pulled all troops from all foreign countries.At least with Obama the war in Iran will not be as large scale.And Romney was threatening China even before he won. Just what we need, a war with a country where they WANT large scale depopulation. If Bitcoin becomes a religion then schools would not be able to allow anything Bitcoin related to be mentioned.Wording would have to be changed in order to allow anything Bitcoin related at school.See "Holiday parties" or "Winter break"...

Your friend is a liar. Kick his ass. I could see a place surviving by only accepting Bitcoin if they had an easy cash->BTC exchange right there. Kinda like "there's an ATM outside".I went to a bar that only accepted cash but they had a little device in the corner where you swipe your card and "withdraw" cash via the bartender giving you cash from the drawer. Then you pay it right back.Most likely this is to get around the 2-3% charge as well as avoid a paper trail for the IRS. I hoarded my large Bitcoin purchase for over a year. I had a few electronic copies of my private address as well as a piece of paper in my house with it written down.Then I was short on funds for a downpayment on a house.I was able to stop hoarding and put those BTC toward cash for my house.If I had not hoarded and spent on Alpaca socks I would have warm feet...out on the street. My thoughts for the reason behind this concept would be a way to allow for a POS transaction by transferring BTC to a bank account where you have a debit card and putting only enough money into the account to  cover the transaction.For example, you are at a restaurant and get your tab, you figure out your tip and pull out your phone and transfer BTC to cash to cover the meal. By the time the waitress comes to pick up the check the cash has been deposited and your meal gets paid for.If more time is needed you could transfer a larger amount before the meal to guarantee the transaction goes through by the time you need it. Customer A has 5 BTC and wants cash for it (assume a $10/BTC current rate). He goes to Company B's website and puts in his information and which account he wants filled then sends 5BTC.Company B employee at Wells Fargo sees that a transaction has gone through for 5 BTC. He takes $50 minus a 1% fee of 50 cents depositing $49.50 in Customer A's Wells Fargo account. Like I said, the commission could be small if volume is high enough and you were just paying one employee per bank.Or even if needed, have a monthly membership fee for the use with maximum amount of transactions. That way you can have customer information as needed. All good information.If this could be done with high enough volume, a company could set up an API for other companies to sell their services and charge for instant BTC to bank cash.I do see the difficulties with it though. From what I have seen, electronic transfers and such take time and are reversible and sometimes come with fees. This makes it difficult to get a quick transfer from BTC to cash.What if someone formed a company where they just had an employee sitting at the bank all day, someone requests BTC for cash in their bank account. The employee goes to the teller with a stack of cash and deposits it into the account once the BTC has gone through. The customer gets the funds instantly into their account because it was cash, and no reverse can take place.This could be done initially at a few major banks used by the most customers.The company's main cost would be paying the employee an hourly wage which, if volume is high enough, would come out to a small portion of the day's transactions allowing for low exchange rates.Sure, you could only get instant transactions during business hours but some people may like such a service.But would this be legal. Someone hanging out at the bank making cash deposits to several different accounts throughout the day... Overstock.com CEO not only supports Ron Paul but instead of going with the flow of the typical American sheep is enlightened enough to understand that throwing his vote away for one of the two monopoly party candidates is just an exercise in servitude. While others would deride him for "throwing away his vote" by voting for someone who will obviously not win, he wears it proudly.Ron Paul's main campaign issue is an end to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the world banks have their hand in just about every aspect of world economic and monetary policy.Bitcoin also goes against the central control of the Federal Reserve and those banks.It would be a natural thing for someone who supports Ron Paul to also support Bitcoin.Considering overstock.com caters to hundreds of thousands of consumers and offers a wide range of products. Their accepting of Bitcoin would be huge.There is also the fact that Patrick Byrne and overstock.com have been fighting Goldmann Sach's Merryl Lynch and others in a lawsuit for quite some time:http://www.overstock.com/50257/static.html
Why is everyone ignoring the obvious BitInstant card?BTC to local currency in the form of a debit card transparent to the merchant. During an interview, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne declared that he would be writing in Ron Paul for the election. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDs6KfuIIwU"The Company will hold a conference call .... on Monday, October 29, 2012 at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time.... Please email questions to Kevin Moon at kmoon@overstock.com prior to the conference call. It may be a good idea to ask them to start accepting Bitcoin at overstock.com This is THE Manifesto against the Fed.http://www.amazon.com/The-Revolution-Manifesto-Ron-Paul/dp/0446537519 He pulls out his BitInstant card and swipes it in the credit card machine.He leaves and eats the snacks.While driving (and eating snacks) he sees that Best Buy is having a sale on TVs. He pulls out his phone (while driving) and transfers some Bitcoin to his BitInstant card.He walks into Best Buy and buys a new TV.When he gets home, after setting up the new TV he checks his ING account and see that his paycheck has been deposited. He does a p2p transfer to BitFloor of his paycheck and sets up an auto-exchange from USD to BTC at a desired price.He sets up an auto transfer to send some spending money to his phone and BitInstant card account. It could be like NCI long distance: http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/nci-long-distance/1355242 Physical with GPS linked to every person would be perfect. Maybe instead of a distributed list we give the printing authority to a centralized entity who can print as much as they want (but let the government choose their chairman for the sake of oversight). obvious troll is obvious It appears that there is more than one genius on this board. toucheWe would be more popular than PayPal within the week if we did that. The only thing keeping Bitcoin from becoming used by everyone in the world is the long addresses. We need to shorten them to make it easier for the public.Since people are able to remember their phone numbers, we should make the address only 10 characters long and only consist of numbers and add two numbers for country codes.And the private address is way too long. Just make it an 8 character max with upper and lower case letters like a password.And people should be allowed to have easy addresses like 1234567890 or 1111111111.Implement this and I guarantee every single person in the world will start using Bitcoin tomorrow.No need to branch off a new branch of the Blockchain for my genius idea. Just change all of Bitcoin to comply with this new strategy.Ok, I am sure I will get some troll in here saying stuff like "10 numbers is too hard".Just to head that off right away, I agree. Maybe some addresses can be less. At least one number though.Or maybe even just have everyone use their first name for their public address and last name for their private address.Make it that easy and it will be a huge hit over night. Only if it is human bone. You can deposit USD into a bank account and get Bitcoins from several exchanges. Any suggestions on a good hosting service that can run Jetty?I am currently using hostmonster but they do not provide enough memory to run jetty.I'm currently paying $8/month and would like to stick around that price or better. SWEET!  Strangely enough, I was thinking about just what your friend said.Many people are nationalists. They are gung ho for their country and everything created around that concept.I could easily see the scenario where I may be out talking about Bitcoin and some meat head speaking up and saying to everyone and to myself "Here in America, we use DOLLARS"...uhh...derr... Pics or none of this is true. x = y-x2= -xyx2 - y2 = x2 - xy(x + y)(x - y) = x(x - y)x + x = y2 + 2 = 5  Waa!?!? I spent like 5 hours on that masterpiece!  Can't wait until the price climbs thanks to another great banking plan. Hope this one doesn't fail for personal reasons like the other one...it was so close. I have seen postings in several different sections asking for someone who can code in Java, C++ or whichever.It would be nice if they were all in the same section. That was 8 weeks ago...
Here is mine:ANONYMOUS ADS!!!!! Interesting approach. I will look into that approach a bit more. I already have a transparent way for everyone to vote and have their votes counted. I have been working on the back end to this project and am in the very early stages of getting the front end set up.The tl;dr of it is to have a way of pooling your Bitcoins with people who hold a common goal in mind and "voting" with your bitcoins for the best idea. The idea that gets enough funding moves forward and those who voted to support it can move forward together and plan further goals. While those who did not "vote" for it may later buy in to gain access to future planning.The key to the whole thing is a system I have set up where you will set aside Bitcoins in an address that you own but you have dedicated toward funding various projects. The site will keep track of your pledges and available funds and have a running tally for any project and allow people to submit proposals.Each proposal can be in any form of voting structure. It can request one person/one vote or one person many votes, a vote total for passing, an amount of BTC per vote, a structure for the people who will be handling the funds or an escrow service, a cost for "membership" for anyone after the vote who may want to be admitted and how the fees are distributed to the members (again, no funds to be held centrally). Along with many other adaptations as time goes on.I would work toward making the front end very communication friendly so that people working toward the same goal can have plenty of opportunity to interact and hash things out to keep the total amount of voting to a minimum, probably charging a small fee per proposal to fund the site.I would also likely include the ability to do small voting tallies for things that do not involve funding such as putting someone in charge or other minor things that do not require funding, this would involve a vote using a small amount of BTC like mBTC or uBTC. This would also probably be customizable and included in the proposals.I have been hardening the back-end to make sure that security is built in from the bottom up so I have not been doing much on the web interface yet. But I would hope that this would be of enough interest to people that I could get it going and hopefully have some successful projects. Umm...my garbage service is private. $10 a month. Great service. Glenn Beck: Goonswarm is a CIA frontFIFY I am a java developer with over 15 years of experience including network/IT and project management experience as well.I have been looking to expand my abilities into the Bitcoin realm and would be willing to take extra hours outside of work now that I am wrapping up my Master's degree in IT management.Put me in as available for 10-20 hours per week at a rate of 4BTC/hour. The jews were doing nothing wrong in 1930s Germany. Read an article about it a long time ago.Went to the website and downloaded the client to start mining.Client wouldn't install. Could not figure out mining.Left it to others and their "2 cents per Bitcoin" technology.Read another article a few months later. Holy crap, Bitcoins are worth $2 per Bitcoin.Tried loading the client again. Mining did not work, screwed up my laptop.Left it to others and their "2 dollars per Bitcoin" technology.Read another article in June 2011. Bitcoin went from $10 to $30! Holy crap, this is it...!Cashed out $10k from IRA, got in just in time at $16/BTC before it climbs through the roof!Bitcoinica...Zhoutgouned...Working on figuring out how to use this technology to get back my initial investment. I believe the are calling 1/100 BTC a bitcent. 1/1000 is a mBTC. Perhaps we should strap a raspberri pi computer to squirrels with a USB wireless thumbdrive so that when you are in the park and you see one of these cute squirrels with a computer attached to their back you can "love them" by sending it some BTC.Just have someone plug the computer in for a couple of hours a day to charge.It will be easy to catch the squirrels to do this daily because they will be slowed down by the machine attached to them.Then the squirrel will feel more important because it is not just a little rodent gathering food, he is an animal with some processing power. He will feel very special among his squirrel friends for this.Or perhaps we can brand a QR code on some baby seals to make them feel loved. It will crash. Pirate was the only thing keeping this BTC thing going. Umm, I guess he is saying that you can get a walmart money card, which can be funded by ACH. So, whenever you want to spend money you just:Transfer your BTC to an exchange that offers ACH withdrawal.Trade your BTC for $ on the exchange.Request a withdrawal to your walmart money card ACH account.Wait a few days (or same day for just $3 per $200)Swipe your card.And if you are not willing to do this for every transaction, you are apparently ignorant. I will invest in these just so that I can get in while they are cheap and then sell them when demand raises the price through the roof. I think it will be something to do with unencrypting Bitcoin so it's easier to read. His name is Casascius. He lives on the high seas. From the impression I got from the device, it will only interact with the Bitcoin network at the merchant nodes. One Bitcoin could be transferred back and forth among hundreds of these cards and then when it finally hits a merchant node it will register on the blockchain.Kinda like using a casascius coin. You do not pay transaction fees for each exchange. Anyone currently holding a clearance cannot, or are strongly advised against revealing such in a public forum. Many will list it on their resume but they are told they should not do so.Having a clearance means that you get to do what other companies have outsourced but get paid like people did before their jobs were outsourced.As for what those agencies would likely be doing as far as Bitcoins go...they would likely be paying more attention to the actual code and checking for flaws or ways to use it to track what they need to track.There was another thread which posted a job listing down here at MacDill AFB which was seeking an analyst with some financial background as well as knowledge of Bitcoin and Second Life currency. It also wanted someone who spoke some Arab language. This means that they would like to see how those in the middle east are moving money around. Or maybe they have already determined it and need to track it.I do not work directly for any of the agencies you listed. Someone once posted a calculator which would allow you to post the price and rate that you are making a purchase or sale of Bitcoin and it would give you the price at which you would need to sell or buy to at least break even.That is sorta handy. My hope is that Bitcoin will go lower for the next few months when I can finally buy again starting around February when I should have some more money again to buy.So...buy now...it'll probably go way up.Then in February another downtrend will begin. Ironic that this thread would pop up from over a year ago.I just sold all of my Bitcoin last week for $2k. I initially invested $10k.I got in at $16 with about 625 BTC. With some decent trading I got it up to about 750 as it fell and fell...I was close to 800 at around $5 and decided to try to salvage anything I could by jumping in with Bitcoinica.I got Zhoutghouned several times to the point that I was down to around 200 BTC. After seeing a manipulative trend on Bitcoinica I moved almost all of my BTC out of Bitcoinica about a month before it died.I just bought a pool house last week as an investment for $52k, cashed out my BTC to help with the down-payment.As for Costa Rica...it got too expensive to buy there.
 Interesting, I have never heard of this.  Somalia I always see it mentioned but have never seen it in real life, but where do these investors come from that fund some of the new services coming out?I understand the concept, you have an idea and you pitch it to "someone" and you get a bite and start rolling with it. But is it a matter of knowing a business banker who lets you pitch your business plan in exchange for a business loan? Or is is going to conferences and handing out your card with a minute pitch allowing for a further non-disclosure agreement presentation?Or is it just going through friends and friends' rich investor friends? Getting the word out there.Or do you just set up a basic concept website and start to get traffic and the investors seek you out?I mean, I have invested in a business myself. I dropped $50k into a bar and became 1/3rd silent partner but that came about just because a friend of mine said that his friend who owned a bar needed someone to buy him out. Is that how this tends to happen? Just put the word out?Not asking for specifics, but just an overall idea of how it all goes down. A long September and there's reason to believe maybe this year will be better than the last.  Hmm, a currency that allows someone to track everyone's transactions throughout the whole life of a currency? No NWO here... The current moving Bitcoin economy could probably survive using a single Bitcoin. From one oppressive government to another...at least he is used to hating his government, he'll fit in well here ctrl-f   bitcoinNo Results Ok, with Bitfloor gone....what is the cheapest one now? Bitfloor used to allow free funding of your account using ING Direct's person to person feature.Do any other exchanges accept that? I usually recommend people keep gold for long term investments and pick up Bitcoin as a commodity IPO. High reward potential but still some risk. And I tell them to get ready to start using it as a daily currency once the BitInstant credit card comes out. 1. Sit down at computer2. Buy 10 Bitcoins with Visa card3. Transfer 10 Bitcoins to new account4. Call Visa "My Visa card was stolen"5. Get money back for 10 Bitcoins.6. Profit I named my child 1Lisa2xasj8sl28AlksSj6Sfw6sLKjs2LLsdfj2Then tattooed the private key to the bottom of her foot as a baby.When she is old enough to understand, she will get the coins. Hmm, I was going to buy some december Bitcoins for my family members for Christmas. May as well buy them now since they are only $13.70.Who knows what the price may be by then.If I bought them september Bitcoins they would be like "oh...how long have these things been sitting around?". Do we still use "Visa" cards or "American Express"?Those are so old school...Oh ya...and remember the "Federal Reserve Note"? trolled by a drunk I cannot wait until the new product that our competitor, the Federal Reserve, comes out with to compete.It should be awesome! We can all get very paranoid and do everything we can at the software level to secure our wallets and everything else related to security.But if someone manipulates your hardware, you would likely never know.Are there any ways to counter something like this occurring? Someone at Intel could stick a private key reader into the chip and everyone who uses that chip from then on would be screwed.Or someone could add a chip to the computers as they sit in a huge server room. Or even someone at UPS or FedEx.I only have indirect knowledge of such attacks but am wondering if others have considered this. It would be beneficial for someone to come in behind Bitcoin and offer up a small reward based project that can utilize older mining machines which are of less use because people have moved on to faster machines.There will likely be a bunch of GPU machines out there that will be outdated when it comes to mining. Just as CPU mining reverted to being people's regular computers.
There is a project out there called Internet that uses a lot of CPU. The September announcement is related to this post: I had also heard it was from a popular game or cartoon character. In my country, you do not mine bitcoins...bitcoins mine YOU! I was thinking something more automated and web based.Like a regular exchange where you could log in and get the current exchange rate.The rate would be based upon your preferences such as high level of trust, speed, or rate.People who are willing to trade can set up automatic rate changes to move with the price automatically instead of needing to be on chat saying "I'll give you X for Y".You just set up your exchange abilities (Dwolla, direct deposit, Wells-Fargo, ING, etc) and the rate you are willing to trade and let the server take care of changes in price and all of the rest.It would be just like logging into MtGox but your money could be traded by several different people. You would rate your experience afterwards to let people know how trustworthy someone is. After posting a message about exchanging BTC and getting several PMs from people willing to exchange, it would seem reasonable that a centralized placewith ratings on all of these people willing to trade would be very useful.I know there are IRC sites and a subforum here.But it would be good to be able to go to a website where people could build up their ratings, get verified by the site owner, allow each user to come up with theirown methods of currency transfer and let the user search based on what they feel is most important (trust rating, speed, exchange rate, etc).Plus there would be know way for the exchange to get hacked because everyone would have their own wallets and their own money transfer methods.Sure, there would be a few scammers that would make out with someone's BTC, but you would choose what level of risk you are willing to put up with.Thoughts? So, I am closing on a house Wednesday. I need to withdraw some BTC to dollars (about $2k).I was set to go with bit-pay but they are out of commission.I have an MtGox and dwolla account. If I were to withdraw tomorrow from MtGox to Dwolla, how long would it take to get to my bank account as available funds?Or, is there another quicker method?I know a few people have PMed me that they will buy but I do not trust someone not to do a reverse on me. I downloaded a new client Friday, it went through about 75% of the blockchain download at a decent rate.Then it slowed down with about 20,000 blocks remaining, then eventually froze.I restarted the client and it would go again then slow down again to a halt.I am now at about 9,500 after restarting it off and on over the weekend and it is at the point of giving me one er second or so.I am on a Win7 laptop 4GB Ram, quad 2.5GHZ with plenty hard drive space.Can I just download the chain all at once, then run it through?I am not showing anything out of the ordinary in the task manager performance. Best process that was suggested was to give each voter an address (or two...yes/no) to vote to.Then post an encrypted file listing all of the addresses being used. Keep the password private until after the vote.Reveal the password and all of the addresses can be tallied. Buy half in a way that is as under the radar as possible...do some p2p buys with cash, hit the smaller exchanges, do some trading on mtGox catching any downward pressure.Then take another million and jump on mtGox with it. Create a huge million dollar bid wall and spread the word that you are buying a buttload.You will get a good rally going with your first $400k then start to remove some of your bids with the rest of the $500k as the market takes over the rally.

You can buy fiat with BTC here: http://www.mtgox.com I would be willing to do this and plan on getting as close to this soon.But only after BitInstant comes out with their Visa card and billpay.Then I will have every paycheck converted automatically to Bitcoins and go from there.Not all that exciting though. Hrm...analyst position.And a 48 hour work week at MacDill? That sucks. They are probably required to work on Saturday.
I have not planned on selling but need some cash in a few days.What are the steps to getting cash from Bitcoins? I have about 200 I need to cash out. 42 So will I be able to heat my coffee with a laser? The key there is making Bitcoin comply with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). A hammer can do that!?! I have one of those in the garage!They sell those at family friendly places such as Walmart and Home Depot! We need some laws to deal with this! Combine this with paying for traffic linking two wifi sites and you could avoid the need for ISPs. Oooh...the hints are falling from the sky as things start to become clear.It is in relation to this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93502.msg1034137#msg1034137 Who is "we" and what are the requirements to be part of "the community"?

That might be illegal.""Uhh... really? no.""And where will you get the money to do it?""Uhhh... haven't figured that out yet.""And if I want to participate, what should I do?""Uhh... I dunno, we don't really have a process for that yet..." The wording from the bottom:However, all these considerations did not deter me from the path of duty; the moment I understood the will of my Heavenly Father, I felt a determination to go at all hazards, believing that He would support me by His almighty power, and endow me with every qualification that I needed. (In Orson F. Whitney, Life of Heber C. Kimball, 3d ed., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967, pp. 1034.) Quote was followed by (sic) Best thing for these folks (or anyone for that matter) to do is keep your Bitcoins safe by sending them to my wallet. Then just send me an e-mail letting me know how much was deposited for safe keeping.My wallet is secure. Honest.Address in the sig. Better safe than sorry! I jumped in July of 2011 as it was coming down from $17.I had played around with it and joined the board about a year earlier. Tried to run the mining software on my laptop and it crashed so I stopped trying.

If you get this through, could you then please use some of the lessons learned to go ahead and put onto Blu Ray: Gigli? My mom used to talk about people sending a "Tex Mex". The adverts you show should ask people to donate so that they do not need to see advertisements.Make the text blink in and out so that they see it and donate. We have one of those Wasp scanners here at work for inventory management.The gal that does all of that was pretty excited to see the scanner come in. Apparently it does a lot. The announcement will be made some time between September 4th and September 30th. September annoucement:Bitcoin IPO!
I have not seen Bitcoin used for any criminal acts such as taxation and the initiation of force.That currency lies in government power. Here is the annoucement:youtube.com/rickroll Good to know. I have gone to my banker several times to have them override an overdraft fee. Usually it is their fault for holding up my money for a deposit too large.They say the same thing every time...we let it go through because 'what if it was your mortgage'. At $100 it just means a different number in the Bitcoin wallet than when a previous purchase went through. Bought and spent in the same manner. I was thinking about this. This would be the last step of where I would use a bank once BitInstant has debit card and billpay.I would just have my direct deposit go straight to a bill account and a spending account.I would even write up some budgetting software for my wallet so that my family spending could be trickled out throughout the month (keeping the wife from spending all of the paycheck on a shopping spree). I tried to do it once where I sent so much money to a checking account every day but the bank stopped it because of too many transfers in one month, plus if more was spent than was in the account the bank would charge a fee and let the spending go through. It is September in Bangkok.So...what is it? So you are selling a radio that plays social media jazz??? Would you feel comfortable having a multisig/encrypted wallet somewhere on the Internet where you are required to enter a password any time you need to put money on your card?With a bitcoin debit card the only way I could see someone stealing $700 is if you are about to purchase something worth $700, you transfer the BTC to your card and then someone who cloned it swipes the card before you. Sweet. So I will be able to have a BitInstant credit card for day to day spending of my BTC, and a BitInstant bill pay for paying my bills.And if I wanted to I could get my pay check in paper form and cash it at Walmart only to turn around and deposit that cash at Walmart to BitInstant turning it into Bitcoins.Why use a bank anymore? Are there any services now or upcoming that will offer a bill pay service?I am thinking something like, I fill in a form with address and account number with the date and amount to send. Then I get the amount of BTC into the BTC address by that date and it gets sent out as a check.I would be willing to pay 1% for that. With over $3k in bills every month that would be an easy $30 per month per person for a company to set up. Look at the fringes of our current system that are outside of our socialized medicine.Look at the price and prevalence of Lasik eye surgery. It is a surgery not covered by insurance and yet the price gets cheaper, the technology improves significantly and it is offered all over the place.Imagine the same for every other medical treatment. Government monopoly on airwaves. I can choose another garbage company, and another TV/Internet company. When I lived in Texas I could choose between electric companies. Unfortunately here there is only one. My water and sewage companies are local co-ops. Run by committee chairmen voted by members(anyone who uses their service). I do not see why another water company could not come in and compete. This one has just been around for so long that there is not much demand for another one. I ran for water chair last year but lost by 4 votes. It is a very small company. Where I live, no utility I use is publicly run. All private. Water, sewer, TV/Internet, electric. My garbage service is also private. I used to live somewhere that had a private fire department that was better than any other fire department in the state. My local fire company used to be private until the county passed a law to take all of the private companies over.The reason it is so hard for people to imagine roads as private entities is because they have not experienced them themselves. It will likely be like how we all pay sales taxes on our Internet transactions when the transaction is with a company in the same state.I do that every time. Diligently.  Competing phone companies often share the same line. They 'lease' time for their customers.Same could be done for roads. Speech I gave at a local tea party event:--------------------------------------I consider myself fairly libertarian in my thinking and don't see all that much that couldn't be privatized or left to the free market. From time to time I will bring this up to people and inevitably I get the response..."what about the roads?"What about the roads...What about the roads is so great? Sure, they get you from point A to point B, but they get you there in the most inconvenient way possible. It's like dealing with the DMV on a daily basis.What about the roads is so great...is it the long waits at red lights? Is it the amount of time wasted sitting in traffic? Is it the fact that roads are so dangerous? According to the CDC, accidents on our roads are the leading cause of death for US teens accounting for 1 in 3 deaths in this age group. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports over six and a half million car accidents per year. A Federal Highway Administration study showed that 34% of serious accidents had contributing factors relating to the roadway. People are literally dying in the streets and yet we put up with it because the government owns the roads.Let me ask a question...has anyone here ever been in a car accident? Been stuck in traffic? Waited too long at a red light?Why do we put up with this?The blame gets shifted to cell phone use or drunk driving. More laws to fix bad government. The real question should be, why do we put up with a road system that hasn't changed in the past 100 years?For 50 years we lived under a government mandated phone monopoly where we were stuck with the home telephone where we pick up the handset, dial the number and talk to the person on the other end. And we were fine with this. We didn't want anyone to mess with it because it worked. But competition was allowed in and we had more choices. The telephone system got better. Now hardly anyone uses the old system, there are so many better choices out there. The same could happen for the roads.The next time you are stuck in traffic, you are at a red light or have the unfortunate thing happen, where you are in a car accident I want you to just give this some thought. To just imagine...Imagine...Imagine being able to get to work with no hassle and no delays.Imagine being able to get in your car in the morning and have your car drive you to work on the smart road while you catch up on that last bit of sleep or eat your breakfast or read a paper.Imagine driving in an electric car that is charged by the road with wireless induction.Imagine a world without the need for foreign oil.All of this is possible, the technology is there.But we are stuck in the belief that what our government has provided for us in the way of roads is the best solution.It is time we accept alternatives, it's time that we stop accepting the same old roads as a given and allow the free market to offer us more.What about the roads?I agree, What about the roads!----------------------------------------------------- The original roads were not government created.We were stuck with government controlled phones between 1934 and 1984 too. 50 years of a single company controlling the phone systems.If roads were privatized, we would go from the single choice long distance we had back in the 80s to the advances we have today. Perpetuating the government road system is a detriment to transportation advancement and a shame that we are stuck with it. Now you know of some created by private industry:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_highways_in_the_United_States How 20th century of them...lol
My statement (Dont use things that come from freedom if you do not support freedom) makes sense.Your statement (Dont use things that come from socialism if you do not support socialism) doesn't make sense. Kindly stop using the free market... Thanks Being the loyal servant citizen that I am, I report any earning that I make in Bitcoins to my tax man. I also never carry federal reserve notes as they have trace amounts of cocaine on them and I am not willing to violate the law when it comes to possessing an illegal substance. I never bet in any office gambling pools and I make sure to inform the police if I see such legal activity going on so as not to be in collusion with such an offense.Being the loyal servant that I am, I am wondering about the various new ways of converting BTC to dollars.One being the BitInstant Visa card. You can put BTC in your account and when you make a purchase they convert it to dollars for you. So, what happens if the price of Bitcoins went up between the time I purchased them to the time I swipe my Visa card? BitInstant is the one who converts it from BTC to dollars and pays the merchant. So, do I pay taxes for the extra value gained in the transaction? Does the fact that I converted my dollars to BTC when I could buy 1 steak for 1 BTC then when I go to make my purchase, the value is 2 steaks for 1 BTC. Do I have to now pay taxes on the value of the extra steak? If that were the case, when I make $20 and it can then be used to buy 2 steaks, but then after some time I can now only purchase 1 steak...I cannot take a tax hit for that transaction. So, being the loyal citizen, who pays the taxes for gained value of the BTC?Or in another case. The OpenPay scenario. You have BTC in your wallet. You go to a store and swipe your card. You pay BTC for your product and it goes into the credit card network. The merchant then decides if he wants the BTC or wants it converted to dollars. Who gets taxed there?It is pretty straightforward when going from dollars to BTC to dollars. It is even clear for a miner to calculate gained capital minus production costs of selling BTC for dollars. But what about BTC for goods?I am a loyal servant to my great leader Obama and would never do anything illegal (just to make that clear to any of the fine custodians of this great nation which may be reading this right now). So this may be something that would need to be addressed.I am not saying that I approve of such careless proposals, but Ron Paul's competing currencies law would probably clear this all up. But I support our current governments laws and would never imply that they should not be followed to the T. Googletrends! Google trend thread revisited! The Bitcoin price is a good indicator of how the google search traffic will be.Use it at your own discression! It is QUICK BITCOINS BTCPANTRY.COMBasically saying that you can make some quick BTC if you sell some baked goods. Close, but the BitInstant will allow BTC to cash at the swipe of the card. Not a few days before. All of my messages fly coach. Bitcoin is like giving guns to every human in the world.On the upside, it empowers people.On the downside, it empowers people. Courier New Not too shabby. I also noticed on Bitfloor's website that they allow ING person 2 person transfers for free.I have an ING account. That would be very convenient. With so many different ways to exchange $ for BTC these days, I would like to catch up and find out what is the cheapest for, say $2,000, twice a month.That would be $2k in a bank account.And what would be the steps to go from that $2k in my account to BTC in my wallet?Thanks. It turns your bitcoin wallet into a bank.That is well worth it in my book.  Says the agent. On second thought, I am not sure this is all that great for paying bills. I forgot to take into account exchange fees. Adding just 1% to the monthly bills is no problem considering the value of Bitcoin will likely go up more than 12% per year. But adding a few more percent just to convert $ to BTC then back to $ would likely not be worth it. I am salivating right now. This goes beyond just helping to get bitcoins out there. It is a very useful card as well.The way I see it is this. Right now I have a weekly budget. I have my direct deposit go into one account, then it moves a week's worth of spending money to another checking account. My wife and I use the spending card for our day to day spending while the main account is used for bills.Now, with this, I set up a Dwolla instant transfer every day I get paid. It goes to MtGox and gets converted to BTC. I then set up a weekly transfer to my BitInstant card for my weekly spending budget.One question I have is...can I use this card to pay for bills online? Many of my bills accept a debit card for automatic payments.If I could get all of my bills paid with this I could have all of my money converted to Bitcoins through my direct deposit of my paycheck. The only reason to have a bank account would be to send my direct deposit from work to Dwolla. Say I am shorting 10 BTC at 10:1 at the price of $9/BTC.At $9.5 I am forced to liquidate.If the price jumps up to $9.4 then returns to $9 I am still sitting at the same 10 BTC.If the price jumps up to $9.6 then returns to $9 I have zero BTC.Who gets those 10 BTC when it jumps up to $9.6 then back? Well, that is one ponzi scheme that will NEVER fail...right...I cannot wait to start receiving my checks in 30 years!
My dad receives a check every month from a ponzi he contributed to all of his life, so I know that it is possible to keep paying out on a ponzi scheme. The price was rising slowly based on more than just the ponzi scheme. There are a lot of advances and the block reward is dropping in half. This means that we are outpacing the 50% inflation at the current rate. When the inflation rate is cut in half and we continue at this rate, that means a 25% increase in value yearly at least.Pirate dropped about 10k BTC last month and the price dropped from $9 to $8. He dropped 100k BTC over the weekend. It was bound to fall. He can only drop it that much 4 more times. Hmm, last I checked Pirate has over 400k BTC, the most of anyone else.His strategy is to buy high and sell low.So...if you want to be rich like Pirate...buy high and sell low!I am buying up a buttload right now hoping for a drop so I can sell sell sell!!!PROFIT! Do not forget to have enough funds to push the market either way to make people who are leveraged lose their money. Then return the BTC to the market price.AKA The Manipulator I did this once. Went to that bar in Orlando that accepts Bitcoin. Bought a beer and some nachos and paid in Bitcoin. What they did not know is that I overclocked my CPU at home to 66MHz and executed the 51% attack perfectly.By the time I walked out, the Bitcoin I had used to buy the beer was back in my wallet and nobody was the wiser.Though when I got home, my overclocked computer was fried. Lost all of my favorite gifs and clean Win3.1 install. One hundred MILLION dollars!!!! Ahahahahaha!!! Some day I plan on popping open one of my old math text books and running through the SHA-256 math formula and solve it for 'x'. Where 'x' is the private key of Pirate's BTC address.Should be close to the difficulty of solving the Pythagorean theorem and such. Maybe with a few more symbols and numbers. Like E=mc^2 I got a pre-release of Bitcoin 2 over the weekend.Man that thing is fast! And the graphics...WOW!!!It is well worth at least $600 each. Stand by for my review on my Bitcoin release blog... No ceilings in my world! I have thought about this and can see it legitimately working. The key is having enough large BTC holders taking part or a few people with a large holding in BTC.What would basically happen is that a price would be chosen. Say, $10/BTC. Then this group sets up a bid and sell wall at $9.50 and $10.50.As one wall gets hit, the money is transferred to the other wall. As that gets hit it builds up the other. Being spread apart by $1,  profit is able to keep it going. At any time, the group can decide to bump up the price a small bit at a time. They decide on $10.50. They bring up the wall from $9.50 to $10 and raise the wall from $10.50 to $11.The key is that the walls are large enough that they do not get stuck with all of their money on one side or another as a huge rally or crash occurs.It would be like a Federal Reserve Board determining the price. But they would still have to react to market sentiment because their walls would be affected. I sent 23 million BTC to that address. Looking forward to some big returns! Is this Miss Bitcoin Savings & Trust? Looks like Pirate cashed out a big chunk. It means that some dumbass cannot spell.QUICKITCOINSBTCPANTRY.COM Also: http://www.ronpaulforums.com/showthread.php?289898-What-is-with-the-bitcoin-obsession&p=4572139&viewfull=1#post4572139 I wish the price dropped to $1.But wait about 6 months when I have some big money coming in to buy a buttload of BTC.Right now I am broke so the only price that matters is if it jumps over $50k/BTC. Then I sell. Thanks. I think this is where I need to focus first.I tend to do everything command line so it can be difficult. I set up a tomcat web.xml once by hand and recall that it was a bitch.But I would rather do it that way and understand what everything is configured to than just letting Eclipse fill everything in for me. Black Monday with a drop and a roller coaster throughout the week.I could see it falling to around 8 or 9.It will likely go back to stability once it is cleared up in a week or two. This is not really a BTC specific question but I am frustrated and ultimately will be using this for BTC.I am looking for the best way to be able to write a Java server instance that can be called from a website and return JSON strings.I am running Ubuntu and JDK 1.6.I have tried a few things I found on the Internet. Jax-ws, JSON-RPC 2.0...The Jax-ws I tried had a hello world example that I just could not get running. I could run it with the example war in tomcat 7 but when I tried to compile it with the source it just would not work. I got the JSON-RPC Server compiled to get a jar as well as the required JSON-RPC Base but could find absolutely nothing on how I am supposed to install or run it.All I want is to get to the point of a simple "hello world" where I send a simple string and return "hello world" in JSON format. From there I can expand upon it.I have worked on the client side with JSON and java apps at work but have not implemented a server.Any help would be appreciated. Well, it was definitely not a ponzi scheme.To prove this, I am taking off where pirate40 left off but I will offer 10% per week!Just send me all of your bitcoins. Your BTC will be safe with me.No need to disclose how I am able to give such high returns, that is for me to know and you to find out in a few weeks  (or as long as the money rolls in at a +10% rate).
I am sure that many who had the idea of credit cards early on were facing the same question.Why put so much effort into getting people to put away cash and carry some card with a bunch of numbers on it only to be required to find certain diners clubs that accept that card? Then you have to sign something saying you agree to the payment. Then you have to later get a bill for the amount you spent that month and then you need to write a check out to that company in order to pay off your "balance".Far too complicated for the average joe who would much rather just cash his check and pay for things with money. I am working on an application where there may, at times, require a small level of trust built up between the various users. Would it be worth it to require real names, ala Facebook, when using the service and interacting with others online to enhance that trust. Or is the culture ofInternet anonymity too much to the point where few people would want to sign up?I prefer to stay pseudo-anonymous on most sites I go to. Sure you could find out who I am easily with a google search, but I prefer presenting my "Internet self" to those who do not know me personally. And tend to feel more at ease as an avatar on the web.And I do know that by requiring a "real name" could just end up with a bunch of people making up fake personas with real world names. But that is easy to pull the veil off of and forever expose the liar behind the fake name than trying to find out if some anonymous person going by "pirate40" should be trusted or not.Thoughts? Input? Shh...Some people around here like to cling onto the belief that Satoshi is some living breathing person who swept in, created Bitcoin, then ascended into the ether.They probably also believe in the great spaghetti monster and Santa Claus.  There are already services out there for this. The company I work for just had a team come in and do this, providing a decent report of vulnerabilities. Rather than look into the Bitcoin community for this, look into experts who do this for a living every day. Back in early July 2011 I bought in with $10k at around $14.20. That was down from $17 so I thought I got a bargain.It has been a long rough year since.In my attempt to try to "get my money back", I got Zhoutgouned for most of it around the $4 mark.Wish I had my original amount still in BTC. As they say, you haven't lost money until you cash out at a loss. The quote is: "The Bitcoin Project will be making a major announcement in September that should contribute some stability"I do not see any game changer here. I will also be making a major announcement in September that may be kinda exciting.Or it may not. My exit strategy is moving all of my BTC from my MtGox account to an off site wallet.I know that once the pirate thing hits there will likely be a drop in price but in the long term it will rise.I wish I had more money sooner to put into BTC. I had no money when it was $2/BTC. I still have no money to put in at $14/BTC. I hope the price is not too high when I do have money. Likely, though you would have to do a lot of the leg work yourself to get the cheapest rate (running your own bitcoin transaction server, setting up your card...).More than likely there will be services out there that set things up for you and it will be close to the rate of a prepaid card. Most likely having multisig all finished and vetted for release.We all know about multisig but it will likely be a significant enough update to warrant an announcement to those who have not been following. According to these charts the price will be going higher:___/ Tell them it is like sending text messages but instead of sending words, you are sending money.Or if they know nothing of technology just tell them that because of all of the expenses and debt they built up, we are jumping ship to a new money without all of the baggage. Be sure to mention that even though they "paid into social security" (paid taxes) all of their lives. They are now "getting it back" (receiving welfare) but in money that nobody wants. https://www.payza.com/for the actual link  I have had nothing but good experiences with the BBB. I had some problems with AT&T and when I contacted the BBB, AT&T worked with me to make it right. Same with Verizon.Some companies take their BBB rating seriously. He needs to set it up to create an address for each new donor and allow for the donor to supply their identifiable information along with that address. And refund anything over an equivalent maximum in dollars.I was thinking about this one though.It would be great if someone were to start running now for US House/Senate or whichever where they would need a lot of money to win, focusing on 2014 or 2016. But for every donation he receives, he converts that money to Bitcoin to be spent the year that he campaigns.Imagine someone accumulating $100k when the price was at $2/BTC. And imagine if the price in 2016 was $200/BTC. He would have a $10 million war chest going into the election. And he can pledge to pay for all advertising/campaign material in bitcoins. Paul Ryan = More of the same You could go with the model of Angie's List where the consumer pays to find out the rating of different companies. For my purposes I am not really interested in knowing about more than a few BTC. This is not yet another "I want to know who has a lot of Bitcoin" poll.This is more for the general Bitcoin enthusiast or forum participant. I am curious to know about those who are just starting out or the typical bitcoin supporter how much they may have available.The reason being, I am working on a site where you will be sending bitcoins (not necessarily spending them, just showing that you have them) and I need to know how small of an amount will be the cutoff for the typical user.Personally, I followed Bitcoin on and off for about a year before getting any. I want to know if that is typical. At $2/BTC:"OH NO, CUTTING MINING IN HALF WILL CAUSE EVERYONE TO STOP MINING!"At $4/BTC:"OH NO, CUTTING MINING IN HALF ISN'T WORTH IT!"At $8/BTC:"WE CAN'T AFFORD CUTTING OUR MINING PROFIT IN HALF!"At $11.50/BTC:"TOO MANY PEOPLE USING BITCOIN! MINING WILL STOP IF WE KEEP HALVING THE REWARD!"
So I assume that means that parsing the full blockchain is the way to go. I cannot rely on a third party. I am looking to check an address to see if it is empty and if not empty, check to see how many bitcoins the address contains.Would I be able to do this with a call from bitcoinj or would I need to add up transactions through the blockchain or what? You can use the same website that they use to track dollars that have been used for bad things.You DO check that site every transaction you make right? RIGHT??!? tick tick tick...  Ok, thanks. It is an empty wallet I installed just to confirm that I would be able to import this address and use it.I am taking my BTC off of MtGox and wanted to make sure it is secure and wanted to confirm with my own eyes that the address is working correctly for me to spend in the future. Bitcoin certification would be handy. I can imagine soon some companies will want to hire Bitcoin programmers for their project and the will want to know that they are getting somebody competent.Though I am no fan whatsoever of certifications to prove that you are competent in something, this seems to be popular among employers. Ok, I was able to import this into my wallet and confirm the balance.Not trusting my work computer or just about any computer...now that I have seen this work I can delete my wallet.dat correct? Or is there a way to get that address out of there? Just to be sure. I created the vanity address in my sig using the vanity generator.It gave me that address and then private address.I wrote down/copied in multiple places the private address.I have not put that address into a wallet but have had a few BTC sent to the public address.Before I send more BTC to the address, I just want to confirm that as long as I have that private address, I will be able to eventually import it into a wallet and spend those BTC.Is this correct?Thanks. It is legit. I sold 2 BTC for 1 million each. I would have asked for more but that would have been greedy. Looks great. Good job! Umm, bit-pay takes Bitcoins and turns them into cash. Bitcoin would need to be at about $5,000 to $10,000 for me to live off of my current Bitcoin at my current lifestyle.I definitely need more bitcoins. With my company I can choose a percentage of different accounts that I want my paycheck to go into.Right now it is 100% into my checking account, but it would be great if I could specify 10% going into an account that converts it into a Bitcoin address for me.Sure I can do this manually by transferring a certain amount each pay period to Dwolla and then to MtGox and then purchase BTC. But it would seem reasonable that a Bitcoin company would do well providing such a service. Most merchants have a smartphone with a QR scanner...https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YZ-pqo0cLcE It could be considered more like an e-mail. Bitcoin will go the way of the dodo bird once we can teleport gold atoms back and forth.http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112534053/photons-teleported-60-miles-by-chinese-researchers/ I looked into this initially merely because it was an argument used against pushing for a return to the gold standard as a currency many years ago because "The US doesn't produce gold as quickly as other countries so going back to the gold standard would be worse than staying with the dollar."So I figured I would see how Bitcoin compares in that regard to gold.Certainly Bitcoin is a currency of the individual but if a government can be tempted to embrace it based upon the fact that it would give it more power within the world, it should be highlighted. Such a collective approach could also be used against those government officials whom would see fit to try to inhibit Bitcoin's use. True, having 40% of the Bitcoin economy hit by an overarching government would have a significant affect. If the whole world were to change their currency tomorrow and had the choice between gold or Bitcoin, Americans would be well served if Bitcoin was chosen. The reason being, we are richer in Bitcoin compared to the rest of the world than we are in gold compared to the rest of the world.In tons of gold, the United States holds 8,133 out of a total 30,623 with the closest holder being Germany with 3,396. That is 26.5% of the world's gold controlled by the United States. (according to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_reserve)In number of Bitcoin hosts, the United States has 6005 out of a total 14,727 with the closest holder being Germany with 1096. That is 40.7% of the world's Bitcoin nodes controlled by the United States. (according to: http://bitcoinstatus.rowit.co.uk/)If tomorrow the whole world switched over to Bitcoin, we would hold over 40% of the world's wealth. This would solidify our presence on top of the world stage for a long time to come.Even without switching over tomorrow, the eventuality of Bitcoin becoming a dominant world currency presents the challenge to all nations to get a larger piece of the pie before other countries catch on and get priced out of existence.And yes, I do realize that the number of nodes does not necessarily mean that the amount of Bitcoins is evenly distributed between all nodes, but it gives a good statistical indicator in a currency where anonymity does not allow for knowledge of who owns what amount of bitcoin.So, at the moment, it would benefit all Americans to start pushing Bitcoin as a viable currency and start pushing that 40% higher before other countries catch on and tip the scale in their favor. And at current prices, that would not be very difficult to do. Communal property leads to species going extinct.
Since time immemorial and pre-industrial, 'greed' has been the accusation hurled at the rich by the concrete-bound illiterates who were unable to conceive of the source of wealth or of the motivation of those who produce it. - Ayn Rand Ok, I have taken the title of this thread to heart and stopped programming my web app.The app would have made it possible to use Bitcoin at any retailer online and also all POS transactions. It would also allow texting and cell phone service anywhere via the blockchain for one Satoshi per month. I was just finishing up the code that piggybacked the mining GPU to help tell the future through a complex algorithm that could tell you what was going to happen the next day based upon a solved block.I just did a rm -f /* on my server and have quit my job as a software engineer telling my boss that the work we are doing is pointless because it is not secure. He agreed and quit, all the way up the ladder everyone is quitting and the company is shuttering their doors.Thank You. Advice heeded. So you're saying there's a chance... Safes have time controls where only certain times of day you can open it.Same could be done for a wallet. Laser etching it into a diamond that you then make into a wedding ring would be the ultimate sign of love.The ring could then be passed down generation by generation. I can see some beings or humans in the future unearthing these metal pieces with long strings of numbers and letters trying to figure out what it is. That is how much a flux capacitor requires. I would love such an option. It is not likely to be implemented though. 1.21 gigawatts I put all of my money into Carrotica and someone stole all of their carrots. Who do we sue? Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which can be transferred all over the world. This is done by computers all over the world that are running software to "mine" bitcoins and provide the infrastructure for the currency. One of the major questions of anyone who wants to know about Bitcoin is "where can I use it?". And you get the chicken and egg thing of only a few people accept them because only a few people use them, etc...What if someone came up with a browser plugin that could detect the page of major retailers checkout page and add an option of "Pay With Bitcoin".You click on the "Pay With Bitcoin" button and the plugin reads the page to gather the order product IDs and quantity and anything else dealing with that website. Then it takes you to another page where you fill in your shipping information and anything else needed by the retailer. Then you get a price in Bitcoin and you pay for the items.On the other end, the company or trusted user receives the bitcoin and uses their credit card or other payment option to pay for the items and fills in the customer's shipping information.On the back end, the person is getting bitcoin so they are paid up front. They could either charge a slight fee for the convenience, or they can just rely on the fact that their credit card company will give them cash back or airline miles or points or whichever. Perhaps with some companies, they give discounts for customers who purchase large quantities or give discounts for using their store brand card. It may not be a whole lot but if someone were able to be the buyer for walmart.com and get $100k per month in purchases, that would be several plane tickets or $1k cash back or whichever.The plugin would only need to detect various websites and then redirect to pages where someone keeps track of the checkout code of that company's website.Could something like this work? Seems like something that would fall in well with bit-pay. No one owns bitcoin?Do the miners not own the BTC they receive for their work? Do I not own the BTC in my wallet? Then money will become a tool of exchange for the machines. It is easier with paper money.90% of all dollars have trace amounts of cocainehttp://articles.cnn.com/2009-08-14/health/cocaine.traces.money_1_cocaine-dollar-bills-paper-bills?_s=PM:HEALTHSo if anyone ever says "If you haven't done anything wrong you shouldn't be worried", remind them that they have possessed and distributed cocaine. Possibly giving cocaine to children.Following zero tolerance, anyone in position of FRNs should be arrested for drug possession. Ok, I was looking at having a list of voter addresses that would then send to either address 1Yes1lksd8sdf986ad5ffasd57a9 or 1No1dfs6as5f4asd3a4h587dfa. Before the vote, everyone would know how many voters there are, a list of all of the addresses, and you could verify that your address is on the list.Then when it is time to vote you combine your wallet into a single address and send a mBTC or whichever to the address you support.At that point, everyone can watch the tally as it comes through, they can verify that the right addresses are sending to the final addresses. Any address not in the list would be refunded. And any amount above the agreed upon vote amount would be refunded. The address with the most BTC wins.I was trying to avoid the use of individual addresses because I did not want the man in the middle being able to play any role once the stage has been set for voting. I can see how pre-publishing a hash of the list could work, while also having the added benefit of not having a final result until after the vote is over as to not influence those who have not yet voted. I was thinking the same thing. When 1 Bitcoin is $100 people may become intimidated that they have to spend SO much just to get one Bitcoin.But if we move from the millibitcoin to the use of the term "mill" or "mili", then it will be like saying "cent" which is 1/100th of a dollar. You don't say centdollars or c$.With Bitcoin at $100, if you had one it would be worth 1000 m or 10m per dollar. I am. William DerBerg BITCOIN FTW!!!'nuff said.Leaving 10 seconds for some sweet lovin...
This is all about the 1% keeping the 99% down!OCCUPY BITCOIN!!! With a better understanding of this, I am wondering about this solution:Before the Bitcoins are sent out, a Bitcoin user could send the amount (minus fee) in his wallet to the address he wants to use (within that wallet) to combine all of his BTC into one.Then, if he sends from that wallet, it would come from that specific address.Is this correct? So sending one Satoshi with no fees would take... Any new developments on this one? Specifically why I broke the second half into its own post:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93145.msg1028350#msg1028350 Youtube video of you holding up or saying your BTC and telling your birth date.This would not be proof enough to be exact but it could differentiate a 16 year old from a 50 year old. Atlas Shrugged part 2 coming out in 80 days.Demand it at your local theater:http://www.atlasshruggedmovie.com/demand I am quite pleased with Bitmit. It is growing so much each day, great job.I sold my first item on there last week and received my bitcoin.For the ladies:https://www.bitmit.net/en/trade/i/2816-high-fashion-mesh-socks/descriptionWomen use Bitcoin too! It shows that you can purchase a $25,000 car which is a replica of the Project X vehicle.But everywhere else on the page it shows how Wikispeed's strength is in its agile development and the fact that the car gets better each week.So, will the $25k car be the same as the Project X vehicle or will it be an updated version based upon all of the new development? Ok, that clears it up quite well.I suppose that I was able to see the exact transaction because I was using an address that I had not sent anything from before, and was the only address in use in my wallet (was using an Android Bitcoin Wallet app). Ok, then it is the concept of "change" that I am not understanding.If you have 20 BTC in address ABC123, why not just send 10 BTC to XYZ111? Instead of sending 20 and getting 10 back? I asked here earlier if a Bitcoin sender could tell a receiver what address that it will be coming from. I was told that the user would not know the address it was coming from. Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=89093.msg982559But I ran a test transaction. I have address: 1KFxTa9tLiM9YayFkdtZ1QvoJs4f7aQhjTand I sent to address:1ELWAR1qFQbfmpMhcsTaBniFRLewrYqGo2It shows up here as 1KFxTa9tLiM9YayFkdtZ1QvoJs4f7aQhjT to 1ELWAR1qFQbfmpMhcsTaBniFRLewrYqGo2http://blockchain.info/address/1ELWAR1qFQbfmpMhcsTaBniFRLewrYqGo2So, if I have the address 1KFxTa9tLiM9YayFkdtZ1QvoJs4f7aQhjT and I told the receiver to associate a transaction from that address with my information, would the receiver not be able to verify that any amount sent from that address is from that user?I am thinking about this not only for merchant transactions but for a voting system I am developing where only people within a group can vote by sending BTC to a single address. The site would verify the source address as someone in that group and everyone would be able to view the vote counts via the blockchain to a "Yes" or "No" address. The reason you would want to know the source address is so that someone does not just pop up several addresses and send in false votes.Any clarification would be helpful, I am digging deeper into the mechanisms of how things work and how to put it to use.EDIT: Ok, I understand now. Clarification needed in my last post. According to the TV, Iran is the devil.I am surprised you are allowed to be on this website.I call for a ban! Bitcoin Wallet for Android Or you could say..."If bread ends up costing $100 per loaf, how the hell do we cash out if we choose to?" Speaking of...I set up the Android Bitcoin app on my touch pad and was looking for the file last night. I searched the directory for wallet and found nothing.Also, if I just write down the PrivKey I should be able to load that up at some point in the future to send BTC right? Not to be underestimated At last...finally we have hamsters in the air.I have told people my whole life that this would one day happen...they did not believe me.Who is laughing now jerks! I just got my Raspberry Pi yesterday.I did not actually purchase the power chord with it. Is that something I can buy at Radio Shack or will I need to order it?I was considering using it as a streaming device for my TV. Everyone bringing their own laptops would certainly be helpful.The training would basically be...how to set up a Bitcoin wallet and get some bitcoins (the exchange part being useful for them getting their first Bitcoins).From there you could show people some websites of places that they can spend their bitcoins.You could have a separate training session for Bitcoin merchants, showing them how to set up Bitcoin payments on their webpage or using bit-pay for POS transactions or other ways of accepting BTC.If they bring their laptops, they can set up their wallet securely right there. Or you could have a computer there and show them how to create a wallet and put it on disk or thumb drive, then let them keep the disk (letting them know that they should transfer the BTC to a new wallet when they get home).You could also show the basic steps on how to get BTC through MtGox or Bitinstant or others.There is much to learn, most likely the basics will be a good start.The exchange would be key. It could also help with funding.
This. You may want to get started now. Nightly Bitcoin training and exchange. It would only boost the bitcoin market if the retailer were large enough. My wife's shop offering 30% off for using Bitcoins would get 1, maybe 2 people to buy with Bitcoins based on such a sale.The key to such a strategy would be knowing that there would be an influx of consumers by doing such a promotion. This is currently not the case.If you were to get a pool of Bitcoin users to start pledging a certain amount of BTC, then once they have accumulated enough BTC pledged then certain retailers may bid to be the retailer of choice. Then those pledged spenders spend their pledged money at that retailer.If you could get a couple thousand BTC pledged and spend it all at one place, then it could make some headlines. This is a decent idea. It would be more like joining a club. You join clubs for certain benefits, you vote on fees, dues and rules and what to do with those fees.It would be interesting if such a club/country were to grow to the point where it can pay for its own military and go in and protect its "citizens" from tyranny. A virtual world fighting against oppressive nations...interesting to think about.I have always considered the best method of "taxation" as an up front fee from new members. That way you have a full understanding of costs as well as a full understanding of the current rules. If the rules change then you are not forced to pay more into it and you are coming in knowing how rules are made and changed. And if you do not like such a system, you are not forced to join. I have always said that if I were to mint gold or silver coins for distribution I would just offer advertising on part of the coin to pay for the minting costs. That way, people could get the coins at the cost of the metal.It would not work so well with this application as the paper is going to be thrown away and will not be widely circulated. Fortunately there has not been that huge of a fluctuation over the span of a month for quite a while. But the price fluctuations would not be too big of a deal as most of the money spent will be within days or weeks or receiving it in your account. As most people live paycheck to paycheck. Or is it the love of money thats the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. Its the person who would sell his soul for a bitcent, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of moneyand he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.Let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one anothertheir only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.But money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being richwill not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guiltand of his life, as he deserves.Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standardthe men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted moneythe men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-lawmen who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victimsthen money becomes its creators avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once theyve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a societys virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsionwhen you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothingwhen you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favorswhen you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws dont protect you against them, but protect them against youwhen you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrificeyou may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that is does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is mens protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers deny bitcoin and only allow a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Bitcoin has an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, Account overdrawn.'When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, Who is destroying the world?' You are.You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why its crumbling around you, while youre damning its life-bloodmoney. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout mens history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you repeat with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slavesslaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebodys mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepersas industrialists.To the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a country of moneyand I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, mans mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human beingthe self-made manthe American industrialist.If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choosebecause it contains all the othersthe fact that they were the people who created the phrase to make money. No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantityto be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words to make money hold the essence of human morality.Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters continents. Now the looters credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide as, I think, he will.Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and gunsor bitcoins. Take your choicethere is no otherand your time is running out.--slight changes made to "Francisco's Money Speech" from Atlas Shrugged. So you think that money is the root of all evil?Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which cant exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the virtual shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those bitcoins in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those bitcoins, are a token of honoryour claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money, Is this what you consider evil?Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motionsand youll learn that mans mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.Or do you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of mans capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is madebefore it can be looted or moochedmade by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he cant consume more than he has produced.To trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their lossthe recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your miserythat you must offer them values, not woundsthat the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to mens stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by tradewith reason, not force, as their final arbiterit is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest abilityand the degree of a mans productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider evil?But money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causalitythe men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind.Money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if hes evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if hes evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his money. Is this the reason why you call it evil?Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealththe man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil?Money is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your money by fraud? By pandering to mens vices or mens stupidity? By catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your money will not give you a moments or a satoshis worth of joy. Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then youll scream that money is evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of money?Money will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Money is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money? Does anyone know how companies handle direct deposit for employees? What software they use and how it is processed?The ultimate bump to Bitcoin would be if people start direct depositing their paychecks into their BTC wallets. This, in conjunction with some sort of BTC bill-pay would be great.I am curious about if charge-backs are possible with company direct deposits, or what they would have to go through to make that happen.We are certainly not at the point where companies would be willing to pay in BTC, but we could allow for the transition in the mean time. I think the Federal Reserve should be the central authority for the blockchain. Perhaps your DNA sequence could be used.Add an extra digit to distinguish between twins/triplets/etc (1 for first born,2 for second...) Dollar cost averaging.Spend the same amount of dollars over the full length of time in increments. Perhaps, $100 per day for 40 days. This is like the telephone game.Once you get that Bitcoin back it will be nothing like the one you sent out. Which point? I was addressing his opinion that profiteering is immoral.And I pointed out that others believe it is moral, and the reasoning behind it.The fact that fees are high for some Bitcoin services after such a short period is understandable.After the invention of the telephone, AT&T had a monopoly on telephone technology for 20 years and could charge whatever fee they wanted. At the end of that 20 year monopoly, prices dropped dramatically and choices skyrocketed as competition moved in.A company that creates a new service should expect to do well for a while (at least a few months!), otherwise...why create the service? lol...by "pushing the government over the cliff" they mean that they would get out of the way of those who are currently destroying it, like allowing a child to touch the hot stove instead of interfering. Some would say that it is best for the child to learn his lesson and get burned, others would rather the child not get burned and point out the danger instead. It gets tiring telling the child over and over that it will really hurt if he touches it.  I hate all banks. Not the institutions themselves, or the people who work there. Just the buildings themselves. The actual bank.My hatred has found difficulty since online banks have come into play. I have not actually seen the servers which house these online banks, but I do believe that I would hate that server just as much.I destroyed all piggy banks I saw as a child. Ayn Rand had force initiated against her. She was forced to pay into medicare and social security. Once force has been initiated against you, you have the moral right to both defend yourself and punish, or be justly compensated by, the aggressor. And if you read Atlas Shrugged, the fall of the country to be re-built by those who actually produce was a major point. There are many in the libertarian community that believe that pushing the government over the cliff sooner is the better strategy as opposed to the long slow crash. Letting the socialist movement take its course leads to the same thing each time, it is up to us to prepare for that fall so that we may come out on top afterwards.I, for one, do not support sitting back as liberals and socialists steal from the productive and distribute it among themselves. I am all for getting as much of that stolen loot into the hands of libertarians who will then go on to use that money to fight the very theft that is occurring. To sit idly by and allow the looters to prosper and grow at the expense of the productive is akin to the extermination of productivity.Bitcoin provides one small piece in fighting the thieves. Those who use FRNs are getting wealth stolen every day, most people do not even realize it. A few services that are transparently showing you the fees that you are charged is nothing compared to what the Federal Reserve does. And you have the choice of using those services or not.Again, how often did Karl Marx purchase a product at a free market rate? Did he pay more for a sandwich because the owner's child needed money for the hospital? Did he distribute the money he earned equally to those who needed it the most? Did he live every day of his life strictly confined to the principles of his communist manifesto? Or was he a hypocrite? Or is it not hypocritical to work toward an ideal while still dealing with the imperfect world you are fighting against? And Karl Marx most likely bought a sandwich and earned money by producing a good or service. Was he a hypocrite?Or did he pay more for goods if the person's need was greater? How do you limit a single ID to a single person? You can call it a cooperative if you like. I could see it working for things such as retailers making a bulk purchase from a wholesaler so that they get a lower price with a combined rate. I have belonged to an electric cooperative as opposed to a private or public company. I also currently get my water through a private cooperative. Each customer is also a voting member, we elect a commission each year who then decides who will be the director in charge of day to day operations. Most local services could be provided that way.
Yes, the free market and individuals making individual choices is ideal. But most libertarians understand the concept of trying to organize individualists is like herding cats. Collectivists are able to form groups and combine efforts, but they tend to fail as the planning is centralized and  stifles individuality.What I look at is taking all of those individuals who all have the same goal but do not have the power to combine their efforts toward the same goal.When it comes to a group of people spending their money in a combined effort, this should be easily done voluntarily. Like the example of a group of people putting their money together to buy a park. Something that would otherwise be reserved for someone with a lot of money.Ideally, there would be a group of people with a similar goal that would pledge a certain amount of money. Many ideas would be put forth toward achieving that goal. Members of the group would vote with their money toward the achievement of that goal. If not enough money is voted toward the goal then it fails and other proposals are put forth. If only 80% of the group votes with their money toward the goal but 80% is sufficient, then it goes forward. A new group is formed of those 80% stakeholders and the other 20% has the choice of contributing and having further say or moving on. The proposals put forth could include the organizational rules such as this software would provide, a leader to oversee the spending, a voting method for how to deal with future decisions, dues if necessary and whatever else may be desired. The key being that everyone agrees to how things are set up and nobody is forced to do anything. All while providing a way to combine efforts. I can code, not very well versed in the nuances of C# but started out with C/C++ with some .NET and now mainly work in Java.My focus has been mainly around finding the "perfect" voting system. For me the perfect voting system means that only those people who want something, pay for it and get it.  This gets a bit tricky with things like defense or something that gets paid for and benefits those who do not pay for it, but with moving money around it can be done. At the very least, a voting system that everyone agrees on upfront would be good as well. I was actually coming on here to get some coding advice to get started on something very similar.My plan, however, was to start small. Instead of looking at how a government would work, look to something like a club.Members pay dues, they vote on things and money flows to one thing or another. This is all done voluntarily and no force is used.If such a thing can be done at the small level, it can eventually be ramped up to a small local "government". Imagine a community that already has some government services but would like to better manage their resources. The community can take donations and start improving their community through the use of this organizational software. They may raise enough money to hire a private fire company that serves the members of their club/community. Same with detectives, police, schooling, etc. It does not necessarily need to replace the current government but it may reach the point where enough people in the community are covered by the voluntary government that they vote in the majority to end the services that they are already receiving.I like your implementation of using a blockchain to hold the treasury. My idea was to have everyone hold their dues/fees in a single wallet and vote by moving their funding to the treasury, if the vote does not pass, the funds are returned. Each organization would be able to determine the voting structure and the dues and what happens if dues are not paid.Would love to see your write up, my approach was going to require a centralized location for holding the funds which would require a lot of trust. Is there a way to have P2P e-mail?Basically pay people in BTC to run servers on their computers holding encrypted e-mails with portals which allow people to connect to their e-mail.The e-mail can include a one line ad on the bottom of the e-mail which advertisers pay BTC to have.Thoughts? I cannot wait until this becomes live and I can pay for gas with my Bitcoin card.I know nothing about the credit card system but will gladly contribute my java programming skills, at the very least to help with bug testing. Just remember, any contract with a minor is null and void. Are there any cell phone plans out there where you can pay with Bitcoins?If not, would anyone be interested in such a plan?All anonymous, you buy the phone yourself then get turned on to the cell phone plan paying with Bitcoins. $250,000 in transactions, good to see that your hard work is getting some funding rolling. With the PayPal credit card this is close to the point of being able to keep all of your money in Bitcoins then transfer it to the card when needed.A good step, but the fees will keep it in the realm of a niche market.I understand that PayPal fees suck, which is why Bitcoin is necessary. Hopefully the time will come when transfers will be cheap and quick. What is this thing -> $ <- in your title??? When I saw the title of this thread I figured you were going on a trip and trying to get every location you go to to accept Bitcoin. So that people could then follow your lead and visit the same places. I do think that giving the user the idea that this payment method is more secure, reliable and easy would help sell it.Some thesaurus terms for secure:assured, at ease, balanced, carefree, cinch, conclusive, confident, determined, easy, established, firm, hopeful, in the bag, locked on, nailed down, on ice, reassured, reliable, resolute, sanguine, self-assured, self-confident, settled, shoo-in, solid, sound, stable, steadfast, steady, strong, sure, sure thing, tried and true, unanxious, undoubtful, well-founded reliable:   candid, careful, certain, conscientious, constant, decent, decisive, definite, dependable, determined, devoted, faithful, firm, good, high-principled, honest, honorable, impeccable, incorrupt, loyal, okay, positive, predictable, proved, reputable, respectable, responsible, righteous, safe, sincere, solid, sound, stable, staunch, steadfast, steady, sterling, strong, sure, there, tried, tried-and-true, true, true-blue, true-hearted, trusty, unequivocal, unfailing, unimpeachable, upright, veracious easy:child's play, cinch*, clean, easy as pie, effortless, elementary, facile, incomplex, intelligible, light, lucid, manageable, mild, no problem, no sweat, not difficult, picnic, piece of cake, plain, quiet, self-explanatory, simple as ABC, smooth, snap*, straightforward, transparent, uncomplicated, uninvolved, unmistakable, untroublesome, walkover  Perhaps call it "Secure Open Pay"?secureopenpay.com This would actually make for a very easy way to exchange BTC for cash if you provided an option for "cash back".Buy a pack of gum and ask for $20 cash back. They get the cost of the gum and $20 worth of BTC and you get the gum and cash. Ok, thank you for the clarification. I need to do a bit more research on how things work at that level. Ok, then this is where my understanding of Bitcoin has a hole in it.When you download your wallet you get an address. You use that address to tell people where to send money to get it to you.Does that address not correspond to what you then send to someone else? I have seen one guy in my area accept BTC on craigslist.I thought briefly that it would be a good idea to offer something very cheap and put in the ad that you only accept Bitcoin. But then drop the ad after enough people have figured out how to use Bitcoin.Kinda wrong but it would get exposure. I understand why this is done, you generate a new address for every order that goes through so that you can track that order.But am I missing something here or could you not just have the customer input their own address into a field such as when they fill out their address. Then give them the same address that you use for all customers. Then you can track each order based upon the source address as opposed to generating a bunch of new addresses.Is this feasible? Or start a competing company that is better. It is called the non-initiation of force.If two people's ideals conflict. The moral person will be the one who does not initiate force upon the other.You could love communism and I could love liberty. As soon as you see me make money and attempt to take that money, then you have committed the immoral act.If I see you spread your wealth equally among your commune and I come in and force you to keep it all and not give it away, then that is the point of immorality.And if everyone lived their lives with the goal of being self reliant, then there would be no one that would need society to take care of.And to stifle one's self reliance is an act of stifling one's ability to live. You are basically attacking life and embracing death with every shot at anyone trying to get ahead. And in many ways, a lot of people just yearn for death and an end to human existence. That is their choice. That is something for you to deal with on your own, if you do not like life then embrace death on your own instead of trying to take everyone else down with you.As for Ayn Rand...better to attack the person than the philosophy right?And I do see how one's own well-being is dependent on the well-being of others. All boats rise with the tide. So if one person is able to make a buttload on a Bitcoin service and I start my own service and that person's buttload of Bitcoins gets others to use Bitcoin then I benefit. It would also encourage others to start their own Bitcoin businesses in order to prosper as well. And with that comes competition and better/cheaper services. So yes, someone making huge profits does contribute to my well-being.Greed does not isolate, it leads us all to prosperity.To not be greedy would mean that we do not work for reward. If you do not work for reward you will avoid work. If nobody works, we all die.
You mention that you will see an alias of the local users on the network and be able to scroll through and pay the right one.Imagine I am at Joe's Pizza Place and he has his alias set up as JoesPizzaPlace.Punk ass kid at the restaurant changes his alias to JoesPizzaPIace, or Joe'sPizzaPlace or J0ESPIZZAPLACE.What is to prevent people from sending BTC to the wrong alias? Ok good, because I would not want my vote to be considered as me thinking that "An IOU" is the worst and Bitcoin is best. It would be a good experiment to find a small community where all of the merchants and the citizens could be given the tools and perhaps a few starter Bitcoins as a trial run and let Bitcoins take hold as their currency of choice.The key would be that it has to be small enough where almost everyone in the community can be converted, they would likely need to be young and perhaps tech savvy, and they would have to do a fair amount of in-town spending of their money.There are plenty of small redneck towns but they would likely reject anything new. Perhaps a small college community would be a good start, or something along those lines.I was thinking along the lines of giving everyone a Bitcoincard once it comes out along with like 2 Bitcoins each to get things started. I chose "An IOU" as the best and Bitcoin as the worst.I hope that is reflected in the results correctly. Is this an age verification or an non-American verification quiz? That would make sense considering it would be much easier to convince a merchant to switch over if you could just say "download X software and you can start getting 0-1% transaction fees on certain transactions".And it would certainly be useful for consumers by saying "download X software and start converting your dollars to Bitcoins to avoid needing to deal with banks and credit card companies". In theory...would this allow a merchant to pay 0 fees? An individual's primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well-beingit is for his life and his self-interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code."I swearby my life and my love of itthat I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine." -Ayn Rand I do not believe that Bitcoin is yet ready for government level use. It is not yet ready for a large business.Companies/governments need to have staff that spends money. Right now those large businesses have processes in place for how to track all of the money going through the system and how to keep people accountable for spending (two signatures on checks, receipts, ledgers, etc.).Imagine someone in accounting having a Bitcoin wallet on their desktop. Not only would the accountant be able to copy that wallet and take it home for later use (or skipping the country), but so would IT and possibly anyone else on the corporate network.I am not saying that Bitcoin is not able to be used in such an environment. Just that the processes and software/services have not been properly vetted yet to do so. old thread is old The article mentions that this is just a "new record". Meaning that they have done it before, just faster this time.So the fact that they have cracked it before and Bitcoin was still considered secure would lead me to believe that this time it should not cause much of a ripple. Ya, I have no idea... I like the idea of being able to use any card for the transaction. That would help with implementation by saying "want to skip the bank and credit card companies? run this app".I was wondering if there would be a way to set up the software so that you just check for that card on the OpenPay network before checking the other (debit/credit) networks. That way you would not need to choose "OpenPay" when paying and it would be seamless for the user. And it would be compatible with all merchant machines that way.Also, where is that initial .01 BTC sent from and whom to? From the merchant to the customer BTC client?  Basically, Fujitsu just bought Bitcoin. Good concept. Could the PIN portion of it not be solved by using multisig?Merchant sends a message to send .42 BTC to XYZ address. The client receives the request and attempts the transaction. The multisig transaction is attempted and awaits the second sig method before it finalizes the transaction.Some side suggestions of other ideas I had that would apply here.I had previously suggested something similar to a domain name server but for Bitcoin addresses. Instead of saying "Send the BTC to 1X8JS8SXM42A9W4AJOWQ4262PEW" you would say "Send the BTC to elwarsspendingwallet2012". You could take this concept and have a number DNS setup.And secondly, the concept of award points. A merchant accepting BTC could pay 1% of each transaction toward a reward program that is tied to the spending address. This would be geared toward people who do not use Bitcoin but would be willing to use it in order to get better rewards than the other cards. I can no longer mine Bitcoins on my computer's CPU in the background.For this, I hold the GPU miners responsible. Please stop GPU mining. My wife's store accepts Visa.She has a card swiper connected to her laptop. She logs into a webpage that has the credit card transaction set up. She swipes their card and it fills in all of the card information. She types in the price and submits it. It then prints out a receipt.Will your system work with this?(though she can already accept Bitcoin payments via her smartphone, but just curious) Entirely valid points.Anyone who has used a credit card or debit card has had to make the decision on which card to use and which bank/company to use.Some people make that decision based upon reward points.If it was not true, they would not exist. If it really does make as much as you say it does, it will be inundated by competition and the prices will have to be reduced.As for your toll bridge. Had it been privatized, those tolls would have decreased. Last time I uncoupled the Heisenberg Compensators I got sent back to 1958 in my Delorian.
But would you use the same address for spending if you knew that over time you could get an ounce of silver or a gold coin for using that address at certain merchant websites? Because I may need more Bitcoins or more dollars as any given point. Could you not use one wallet as your spending address and transfer money to that wallet when you want to spend BTC and get rewards? Why would I want to rely upon other people's needs for BTC or dollars to determine my own ratio of BTC to dollars? Some people say (I use that like Fox News to avoid libel) that Bitcoinica purposefully fluctuated the price with large amounts of buys or sells in order to knock people out of their highly leveraged trades.Say there are 1000 people on Bitcoinica leveraged at 10:1 at 4.9 with enough Bitcoin to cover a drop of .2 BTC while there are 200 people leveraged at 10:1 to short at 4.9 with enough to cover a rise of .2. Bitcoinica jumps on MtGox and sells a buttload of BTC making the price drop to 4.6. All 1000 people just lost their positions and got Zhouted. Those 200 people start to get excited but what always happened? It shoots right back up. Bam, it is now at 5.0 and now Bitcoinica has 200 people leveraged at 10:1 at 4.9 to short while the price is at 5.0...another little bump up...bam, they get Zhouted.Bitcoinica now has everyone's coins that they originally received with no payouts. They can now take those BTC and put it back into MtGox to put toward some even larger swings in price for the next victims.Sure, not everyone was hedged at 10:1 and may have had more of a swing covered. Some may have even jumped off during one of the crazy swings at the right time and made a bit of money. But all they had to do was keep an eye on how much of a swing was necessary to make the most people lose leverage and strike when the timing was right.Some people called these swings "the manipulator".Am I against the concept of Bitcoinica and leveraged shorts/longs? No. I agree that it is healthy. How have those big swings been since Bitcoinica went away? Ok, thank you for clarifying the disconnect. I understand the multiple receive addresses.Why would a consumer use different addresses to buy the same thing? Then I have completely misunderstood much of how a Bitcoin transaction works.I was under the impression that I download the BTC client and obtain an address. With that address I can send or receive Bitcoins. If I send Bitcoins, I thought that the blockchain showed how many BTC were transferred from my address to the receiving address.Is this not how it works? Does my address change at some point? Ron Paul supporters are putting on a Ron Paul festival the weekend before the RNC convention.They are getting things set up to start accepting payment for tickets.Please send them a note, http://www.paulfestival.org/contact-us/send-a-note and ask them to accept payment in Bitcoins.This would be a ripe crowd for getting people to use Bitcoins. I hope to go. You mean like on my Casio when I would type 07734 then turn it upside down? The video says that it can send text and pictures.The screen does not appear to be set up for pictures of any significance, and...how would you get the picture? There mere fact that Bitcoin price vs the dollar is not declining, no less increasing while the inflation rate of BTC is up around 50% shows that there is a healthy amount of people buying BTC.In December when that inflation rate drops to 25% and the same amount or more of interest continues, that other 25% will likely be the rate at which it climbs. I was pushing 850 after a start with 700 doing some trading on MtGox.Then I started trading on Bitcoinica.I am now at 180 in my MtGox account. My goal was to get to 1000 then just let that ride into my retirement. I appreciate you highlighting that possible flaw to me. I have over 7 years of experience modeling and simulating large networks so I would certainly run this through some simulations before pushing forward with a retail version.I would imagine that running a simulation would show the optimum size of the files and the quality of video/length of time necessary for it to work. A 5 year track record would help. Looks like a lot of people here have fallen into the MSM's trap.Other people have been shot today. This is no different. Interesting. Though they appear to be more of a centralized repository. But it could definitely help in getting things disseminated. The point of the gadget that is connected to their TV would be that they are made to be an upload point. They cannot refuse to upload as you can now on Bittorrent (unless you do some work with your firewall, etc.).The point is also to not have a central server. The originator merely names his file and puts it in a directory to be accessed by the torrent connection. Then he sends Bitcoins from his address to the main address. The clients would then allow files with that name to be downloaded. It could certainly have some super user nodes that are dedicated just for this, it would need some known hosts when it first connects anyhow before discovering others. Interesting, I cannot download the client at work, but is that a bittorrent program that is streaming different TV channels? Thanks.I too watch Netflix (need to add that as a competitor) for a lot of movies or TV shows, but sometimes you just want to sit down and watch TV, and I know that my parents prefer to just watch TV than having to deal with choosing what videos they want to watch. There is a huge population of people who watch TV "on schedule". You also get the water cooler affect of people talking about something that happened on TV last night or the anticipation of a show that may be coming on soon (I watched Hatfields and McCoys mainly because of chatter from people at work).As for the technology. I was thinking along the lines of a small amount of files, perhaps in 5 minute increments, maybe smaller if there is the opportunity for almost live TV (the actual live show starting 30-60 seconds before the loaded file). And each player would not need to play at the same rate. If you get your show 2-3 minutes after someone else, it will not be that big of a deal. Stock ads could fill time to catch up or delay those times when a connection is having trouble.The key to the torrent will be that as the popularity of it grows, the faster the connection will be. Everyone will be an upload point so the connection will mainly be between neighbors while only one file has to come down the pike into that neighborhood.But it definitely does need to take into account storage space and how long a file lasts on the system. I have ordered my Raspberry Pi and have started working a rudimentary video portion of it just to see if it is feasible. reserved for clarification
I have had this idea for a while and tinkered around a bit with the coding part, but I am working on my Master's thesis which requires an explanation of a business idea that could be helped with the use of IT advances which we have learned about. So any any critiques and input would be much appreciated.1.    Describe the product or service, and describe customers for the product.Idea: A device you plug into your TV set which gives you a free TV channel streamed from the Internet providing original content running 24/7. The hardware would be something like the Raspberry Pi, a miniature computer that can hook up to the Internet and has HDMI output to the TV.The software would be a combination of a video player and Bittorrent. Basically, the shows would be sent out to all of the mini-computers over the Bittorrent network a few minutes before the show starts. Then the computer would start to show the video at the right time. The Bittorrent network would be open so new shows or video could be loaded from anywhere.Where Bitcoin comes in is in telling the video player which video to show. A single address would be used as the central payment location for getting shows on the air. If a company wants their show to play, they will send BTC to that address. The video player will then look for a video with the name ABC_BTC_address_to_XYZ_BTC_address.mpg, based upon the transaction in the blockchain, and play that.This allows the company at XYZ address to get money in order to expand the network and finance programs and everything else necessary to run a TV channel. The individual shows can pay for themselves through advertisements in their video or get people to fund the program or even have a separate website set up where people vote with Bitcoins for the TV show that they want to watch next.There are many other possibilities including multiple channels which can be changed with your cell phone or subscription services, etc. But the basic concept is the decentralized distribution of the TV channel.The goal would be to make this so cheap and simple that you can plug it into your TV and enter your wireless router password and you are all set with a new TV channel. Something so simple that your grandma can plug in, but in reality, the content will likely not be something your grandma would be interested in initially.Because of the decentralized nature of the channel, the content can go beyond what TV networks are allowed to display, whether it is criticism of government in countries that are highly regulated or other uncensored type of material. Though instead of devolving into a porn channel, the central TV channel company would likely try to fund appropriate shows which would encourage more viewers.Initially, being a new technology, the content would likely be geared toward those who like technology so a lot of content such as TechTV and other such content would probably be prominent and shift as the viewer base changes. But the main channel would likely shift toward generic viewership as added channels accessed through a smart phone are accessed by more technically savvy viewers.2.    How does it add value? Where does it fit in the value chain?The added value is the ability to plug in a device into your TV and be able to watch TV shows with no subscription fees. The decentralized nature of it allows for content which would otherwise be suppressed, thus providing information to people that a regular network TV show may be restricted from showing either by the government or their corporate owner which may have their own agenda.This fits in the value chain as entertainment and a free distribution of information to a larger amount of people who do not necessarily have to be tech savvy in order to view it.3.    Describe the competitive landscape of the industry. Briefly explain the current state and then predict how it will evolve.There is certainly competition in the outskirts of the technology. You could just connect your computer via HDMI to your TV and watch Bittorrent videos right now. But you have to go out and search for those videos then wait for them to load and then view it. This requires effort as opposed to being able to sit down on your couch and just turn on the TV and just watch. It also requires a bit of technical savvy which is not as widespread.There are also currently devices out there which allow you to hook up to your TV and has loaded content such as the Roku box or the Boxxi Box or any number of other devices which can store video on the device which you can then search through and find a video to watch. Again, this requires a small amount of effort and does not allow you the ability to just sit back and watch content, most of these devices also restrict the content to a few approved feeds with limited amount of content. There is also the upcoming prominence of integrated applications into the TV. These, again, tend to be searchable videos where you have to expend the effort to find content. Though down the road, this technology could be integrated into a TV set to provide for even easier use.Finally there are the current cable TV providers and network TV. With network TV, you are provided with the same ease of use of this technology. You plug in an antenna and you are able to watch TV shows with no effort. But network stations must pay for the airwaves which requires more commercials and content that tends to revolve around an agenda that is decided at the corporate level, whether well intended or not. They are also under the regulations of governments which wish to regulate what can and cannot go over its air waves. As for cable TV, there is the price of the subscription and similar restrictions to content as network channels.The technology of TV will certainly evolve into more Internet based content and become more of a hybrid of television and Internet but this technology will be a step forward in the process, initially providing easy Internet based content to the average viewer and finally multiple channels which could overcome or compete with the amount of content offered by cable companies with a low cost of distribution.4.    What other firms will compete in this space? How will you differentiate your firm from others?There have been some studies done on P2P TV and some tests. This will be differentiated by the ability to be very decentralized through the use of Bitcoin.(more research needed here)5.    How do the prospects for success evaluate in terms of Michael Porters five forces model and Sun Tzus philosophy?Of the five forces model, this is where this technology stands:Marketing Entry: Though the cost of entry for competitors would be small, this technology is a highly differentiated product which would have time to scale as others work to catch up.Threat of product/service substitution. There are other products which could adapt their technology to try to substitute the technology such as the box hook-ups and integrated TV hardware but most competitors will be tied to a large corporate structure which would take away from the decentralized nature of the technology.Bargaining power of buyers. The buyer has the power in that if they do not like the content, they will discontinue viewing the content which will then turn off the content producers from paying to have their content (and advertising) viewed. But there is no small group that could form to block the operations from moving forward.Bargaining power of suppliers. The suppliers would be both the suppliers of the technology itself and the content providers. The technology is so simplistic that it could be produced in any number of electronics manufacturing plants, and the content providers are so decentralized that if a small block were to refuse to offer content, then someone else will be there to take their place.Rivalry among current competitors.Current TV networks and cable networks have had a hold on this industry for so long that they will not go away silently. There has not been much evidence of them trying to block components from offering video from the Internet to the TV but this is not to say that they may not end up trying to get regulations passed in order to stop this technology from being connected to a television. To this end, the technology itself could be open sourced and the software could be open sourced to the point that anyone could have access while the content continues to be made available.6.    You do not need to submit any financial models or time-to-market predictions (you can submit these if you want as an appendix).Financial models: initial small investment in time to get the software working correctly followed by trial runs on basic hardware, distributed at a low cost for testing. Initial content could be freely added content from vbloggers or as an alternative to YouTube at a very low cost. Followed by a final product which would require an initial investment to buy in bulk and initiate distribution and advertising with an initial investment into content to get the ball rolling.Time to market of a working retail product would be just over a year.-------------------Please poke holes in this, critique it, etc.  this is my very first attempt at getting my thoughts put together so there is much more to do.Thanks I understand that the merchant pays the same regardless of points. But the key here is that he pays.Sure, you could give a discount for using Bitcoin. My wife gives discounts at her retail store for using cash.But with a reward point type of marketing for Bitcoin, it would be the reward company pushing consumers toward using Bitcoin because it would give them a profit. It is almost like every merchant that uses Bitcoin is paying 1% to get people to use Bitcoin.Sure, it is smarter to get something at a slightly lower price at the point of sale. But by the time someone goes to buy something, they already have Bitcoins or not.If I went to a website and saw $98 with Visa or $100 with Amex, it would mean little to me if I did not have a Visa card.But if I saw an ad saying "Get a free vacation by using your Visa card for puchases", I would be willing to start using Visa.One interesting twist would be offering gold and silver as incentives for using Bitcoins.That would blow people's minds. Can it take a bullet? This verse seems prophetic about Bitcoin:Revelations 42:8-12"For he who shall hold the key shall enter the crypt. And all possessions shall be transacted upon by this act. The beast shall break the chains and rise up from the mount. And every bit shall be paid through a number set upon your person." That is all well and good but 43% of consumers use credit cards for purchases over $100 and according to http://finance.yahoo.com/news/summer-travelers-seek-vacations-substance-140000806.html"Forty percent of consumers surveyed belong to a loyalty program with either reward points or frequent flier miles. To keep costs down, 19% percent of summer travelers (up from 15% in 2011) are using rewards points to book. Almost half (47% vs 43% in 2011) are charging their travel expenditures to a credit or charge card. " I was thinking about the consumer and how they may have the choice between using a credit card or using Bitcoin. Most consumers use credit cards because they get perks or reward points that can be used toward airplane trips or vacations.For the merchant, accepting Bitcoins is an obvious choice because you do not have to pay the 2-3% merchant fees and there is no chargeback. For the consumer, the incentive is not there unless the merchant gives a discount for using Bitcoin.Perhaps the merchant would be willing to pay 1% toward a Rewards points type of program. The point system could be completely tied to a BTC address that the consumer uses to pay with. As that user accumulates reward points, it is logged in a server with a company that provides the rewards. Once enough reward points are accumulated, the consumer merely has to send a small transaction to the reward site in exchange for whatever goodie that they have built up.People love reward programs. I used to use my American Express card exclusively as opposed to cash just so that I could accumulate skymiles. I figured out the savings I was getting and it was less than 1% of each purchase going toward a future plane ticket.What do you think? I was thinking about how great it would be if Bitcoin were accepted and widely used in a local community. Local purchases would be encouraged and the price would start to be viewed in terms of its own currency as opposed to a conversion of another.But what would be the ideal location to do this?The best place would be a destination tourist location where most travelers are already converting their currency into the local currency. When you travel abroad you tend to have to exchange your currency anyhow so if there were a travel destination where this was already taking place then a simple conversion to Bitcoin would be no more of a hassle for the travelers.I cannot think of any place off hand. Most of the small carribean countries accept dollars. Even going across the border to Mexico you can pay in dollars.I have gone to video game establishments where you convert your money to tokens or cards with money stored on them, maybe Bitcoin could replace those cards.Any ideas of a community where many people who visit are already exchanging currencies? Preferably some place small with few merchants that could be convinced to accept BTC. How much will I be paid for the traffic going over my node? We are all the same.There is no individuality among us. I am sure someone else has thought of this. But using long ass BTC addresses is akin to everyone still using IP addresses to access web pages. I doubt most people go to specific IP addresses when trying to access a web page. So why would we want people to type in a long string of random characters to send Bitcoins?Could we not figure out a way to create something similar to a Domain Name Server (DNS)? Call it a Bitcoin Address Name Server (BANS).That way I could just tell someone, "send the BTC to ElwarFromUS" or some such name. Companies could say "send it to BitMint-Listing-Fee".Something similar to namecoin could be used to track all registered address names and it would just be a matter of finding a term that has not yet been used. Perhaps pay a fee to the miners per name. It would be great if we could get a few competing Bitcoin escrow companies that retailers could offer as an option for the delivery of goods.It would be great to go to a retail website, pay in BTC and be able to click on the escrow company of your choice and pay a small bit toward the service.It should not be that difficult to set up. Just create an API to hold funds along with criteria that needs to be met for the funds to be released. A simple verification of the criteria when everything goes through is the main work to be done. If the two parties do not agree, then it would be up to the escrow service to most fairly handle it. The most fair escrow services would get the most traffic.Are there any currently out there yet? Do you also, by chance, sell sharks?I have a project that requires both. Tizzy Tazzy: Domains, websites and everything* in between! I too would like to "borrow" 50 BTC for whatever reason you feel secure with.I promise not to disappear. Honest. Person B gets loan.Person B skips town.Person B uses new wallet for future transactions. Instantly install blogs, forums, ecommerce sites and more with TizzyTazzy! Have you noticed the lack of huge dips now that Bitcoinica is out of commission? I just realized...Some stores only take cash. I have gone to several where they say "there's an ATM across the street...".I could definitely see a store saying "we accept cash or Bitcoin". "There's a 7-11 next door..." For now...BitInstant is just getting into the game. With volume they could certainly compete. Step 1: Collect BitcoinsStep 2: ?Step 3: Profit
sweet... Great job guys. This will fill one major hurdle in Bitcoin which is the difficulty in actually getting Bitcoins.Now if we could have the opposite. Go into Walmart with Bitcoins and exchange them for dollars you would have the perfect setup for wire transfers of money that could instantly compete with Western Union.At least bit-pay can do a direct deposit of cash from BTC... Great site, I just checked it out and listed something today.Quick typo fix: Should be Clothes & AccessoriesOne suggestion.Import products via a database.You have a good site, you just need it filled with product. If someone could upload dozens or hundreds of items at once it could fill things up.A spreadsheet delimited like so could work:condition,name,type,duration,shippingto,category,description,pictures,miscThe pictures thing may have some difficulty but the others could work out well.I uploaded about 100 prom dresses to my wife's website using an import. It saved a lot of hassle. I was able to just edit the spreadsheet before uploading. Buy 20 of these at BitMit:http://bitmit.net/en/trade/i/2816-high-fashion-mesh-socks/description There is always someone out there that wants other people to part with their money.Studies have actually been done showing that people are willing to burn their own money if it results in someone with more money burning theirs as well. I too was confused by the term "screw banks".After watching the video I immediately went to a local bank, bored a hole in the side of it and had intercourse with the bank.Boy was I embarrassed when I came back to this thread and read what it really meant.Some people just do not understand slang.You need to put a disclaimer..."do not go have sexual intercourse with a bank". If it saves one other person from the chaffing it would be worth it. I was thinking more along the lines of a group of people with a similar goal but they need to see how much money they will have before going ahead with that goal.This allows a lot of people with a similar interest to get involved and participate in the decision process and then have that final vote on one of the final choices that is presented.You may have a hunting club and you may all want to rent a cabin during the prime hunting season, everyone decides they will put in 100 BTC each for the week. They are not sure how many people they will be able to get to go or what everyone may want to do. So they do this crowdfunding and they may go through several different options until enough people agree on a single choice. The beauty of it is that all of the people who pay, agree with the choice. Those who do not agree do not pay.Imagine a system of government where everything spent by the government was funded this way. You may have a city with property taxes that need to be paid each year. Each person pays in their amount and votes with their dollars where they want their tax dollars to go. The same situation happens if you do not pay toward anything as would happen if you do not pay your taxes. But this way you get to choose what gets done in your city and where your money goes.Also, for those things funded where the people who funded get benefits, you can use the wallet as your identification. Like with the hunting club idea. You show up and pay .0001 BTC from the wallet you used to verify your admission. It allows for anonymity. Bitcoin is not democratic because the minority is not forced to do anything. Answered in separate thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=82350.0 Here is the idea:Set up a way with Bitcoin for a large amount of people to fund something and "vote" on it in a unanimous way where those who do not agree with the vote do not have to contribute.Here is the summary:You get a group together with a common goal. They all pledge so much money until enough people have joined and put their money toward it. Then the final distribution of the money is determined and if enough of the group agrees, then their money is put toward the final goal.Example:A group of people want to purchase a TV commercial. The organizer of the idea says "We will need around $10,000 to produce and run this commercial", we are asking for 100 people to contribute $100 each. People start putting $100 in their wallet pledged toward the commercial project. Once the number is reached the organizer says "We were able to find a production company to make the commercial for $2,500 and negotiated a slot on the Sunday business show for $5,500 totaling $8,000. Please vote if you support this plan by the end of the week. Supporters all move their $100 into the pot. If they do not reach $8,000 in the given time, the money is refunded to each person and they work toward another solution. If the goal is reached, the money is transferred to the production company and the TV station and the commercial is produced. How Bitcoin can help:Same thing, a common goal. The guidelines are outlined. The organizer gives a Bitcoin address for the project with a goal in BTC. People pledge by transferring BTC to a dedicated wallet. They then send .0001 BTC to the Bitcoin address (other numbers can be used to signal different options. ex. .0002 BTC indicates preference 'B'). The .0001 BTC is refunded and that pledge is added to the tally. That wallet address is monitored to see if the money is removed. If the money is removed, the tally goes down indicating the pledger is no longer interested. Once the pledges reach the goal, the organizer puts forth the solution and the needed BTC. Pledgers indicate their approval by sending the full amount of the pledge. If the goal is not met, the BTC is refunded to those wallets and work continues. Otherwise, the organizer executes the solution and the goal is satisfied.Example with BTC:A group of people want to purchase a TV commercial. The organizer of the idea says "We will need around $10,000 to purchase and run this commercial. Here is the BTC address to pledge to: xxxx, indicate your preference: send .0001 for Sunday news program, send .0002 for Monday evening talk show, send .0003 for Saturday morning weekly roundup program.", we are asking for 100 people to pledge 20 BTC each. People start putting 20 BTC into a wallet. They send .0001, 2 or 3 to the address and keep the rest of the funds in their wallet. Once the number gets close to 200 BTC the organizer says "We were able to find a production company to make the commercial for $2,500 and negotiated a slot on the Sunday business show for $5,500 totalling $8,000, at today's rate that would be 160 BTC. Please vote if you support this plan by the end of the week by sending your full amount to address xxxx. Supporters start transferring 20 BTC into the pot each. If they do not reach 160 BTC in the given time, the money is transferred back to the originating addresses and they continue to try to find another solution. If the goal is reached, the BTC is either converted to $$$ to pay the companies, or the originator talks the companies into accepting BTC and transfers the funds for payment and the commercial is produced.Possible use cases:A bunch of Bitcoin users buy an island (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=82060.0). Each person who contributed will be able to prove their membership on the island by showing up on the island and paying with BTC from their pledge wallet.Club membership (dues require X amount spent on pledged programs per year).Funding for BTC projectCharitable contributionsStartup companyFund a movie/commercialdisaster reliefpolitical contributionsFund a piece of artmuch more...similar to projects on http://www.kickstarter.comA web page could be set up for this with the tally and pledges all monitored by monitoring the chain. You could also have the option of allowing people to pledge their set aside BTC to several projects and whichever the pledger supports first will get the BTC and the tally for the other projects will reflect the decrease in their own pledge.The main point of trust is in the final transfer, trusting the organizer to use the money to fund the project as opposed to taking the money and splitting. The web site could keep track of past projects for each organizer and show how well they were handled. But for most of the project, the money sits in your own wallet.Any thoughts? Tweaks, downfalls? Yes, I thought of that. But the 20% that do not agree would be forced to have their money spent on something they do not want. I suppose it could work if you set up a way to send the money back to those who do not want what the final decision is. Perhaps the 80% threshold gets hit and then the BTC gets transferred toward the purchase and the other 20% goes to those addresses that did not agree on the final decision. I have considered something like this for a long time.Crowd funding something.The idea would be to have a type of club where you purchase membership by contributing Bitcoins.The Bitcoin wallet where all of the Bitcoins sit would require a key from each member in order for it to be spent.Once the right opportunity comes along and enough BTC is accumulated, then the members of the club all enter their keys and the BTC gets transferred.The main thing I cannot figure out is if one person wants to sabotage the project they can get their key and hold it over everyone else to either destroy the club or to use it as a bargaining chip to get the money released. The only solutions to this would be situations where not everyone who contributed gets what they want. I would think that a bill pay service would be fairly easy to set up and do pretty well making a few % per transaction.You just set up a web page that accepts BTC, get a form they fill out of the amount, name, address and account number of where they want the check to go. Then just print out the checks and mail them out every day.Sounds like something bit-pay could do fairly easily if they wanted the extra load. Reminds me of an excerpt from the book "Jonathan Gullible (http://www.jonathangullible.com/translations/UK_Comnt040222.pdf)":"Jonathan looked up andsaw two men dragging a young woman, kicking and yelling, downthe trail. By the time he caught his breath, the trio had disappeared.Certain that he couldnt free the woman alone, Jonathan ran back upthe trail looking for help.A clearing opened and he saw a group of people gathered arounda big tree  beating it with sticks. Jonathan ran up and grabbed thearm of a man who was obviously the supervisor. Please sir, help!gasped Jonathan. Two men have captured a woman and she needshelp!Dont be alarmed, the man said gruffly. Shes under arrest.Forget her and move along, weve got work to do.Arrest? said Jonathan, still huffing. She didnt look like, uh,like a criminal. Jonathan wondered, if she was guilty, why didshe cry so desperately for help? Pardon me, sir, but what was hercrime?Huh? snorted the man with irritation. Well, if you must know,she threatened the jobs of everyone working here.She threatened peoples jobs? How did she do that? askedJonathan.Glaring down at his ignorant questioner, the supervisor motionedfor Jonathan to come over to a tree where workers busily poundedaway at the trunk. Proudly, he said, We are tree workers. We knockdown trees for wood by beating them with these sticks. Sometimesa hundred people, working round-the-clock, can knock down agood-sized tree in less than a month. The man pursed his lips andcarefully brushed a speck of dirt from the sleeve of his handsomelycut coat.He continued, That Drawbaugh woman came to work thismorning with a sharp piece of metal attached to the end of her stick.She cut down a tree in less than an hour  all by herself! Think ofit! Such an outrageous threat to our traditional employment had tobe stopped.Jonathans eyes widened, aghast to hear that this woman waspunished for her creativity. Back home, everyone used axes andsaws for cutting trees. Thats how he got the wood for his ownboat. But her invention, exclaimed Jonathan, allows people of allsizes and strengths to cut down trees. Wont that make it faster andcheaper to get wood and make things?What do you mean? the man said angrily. How could anyoneencourage an idea like that? This noble work cant be done by anyweakling who comes along with some new idea.But sir, said Jonathan, trying not to offend, these good treeworkers have talented hands and brains. They could use the timesaved from knocking down trees to do other things. They couldmake tables, cabinets, boats, or even houses! The idea of creating a single company to do this sort of defeats the purpose of using Bitcoins.A single company could just collect money in dollars, keep the money in people's accounts, then set up an API for companies to connect to your server where merchants can connect their APIs.The first step, which would have many more uses than this, would be to integrate a browser plugin with Bitcoin wallets and allow people to just click on a "pay 2 refundable bitcents" button followed by a confirmation by the plugin. With online degree programs, the bot could start graduating from various universities.For no other reason than to be referred to as Dr. Skynet. Quite cool.I see the most difficult part of Bitcoin acceptance being the difficulty in obtaining them.How will they be priced at checkout? Quick change on price kicks all of those leveraged people going long out. Then Bitcoinica can buy back what they just sold and be sitting pretty.Wash rinse, repeat....profit. In space you can use replicators. That will have a huge effect on the market. And....poof.Bitcoinica delivers as expected.
So basically, if you could set it up so you have to send 25 cents worth of BTC to an address, then after a certain amount of time (a month?) you get it back...that would be no big deal to regular people. You spend a few bucks a month on captchas and get it back.But for spammers...doing 1000 at a time, you have to spend $250. Then wait to get that back. That cuts into the monthly budget, $250 for every 1000 captchas used. When enough people are going long, expect the price to drop quickly and just enough for those people to get Zhouted. All for no real market reason other than the fact that Bitcoinica benefits from the quick drop. Then the price slowly goes back to where it was due to market forces. And all of those people who had money in, are now out. On a side note...there is big money in faking users in social media.See - our government:http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/client/229219056Fake people to push propaganda. umm...wtf?You pay some virtual girl to have a virtual relationship with you...then you boast about it in front of your friends?!?umm...wtf??? I am quite perplexed.wtf? I am afraid so. He was known for his evil ways. He was so powerful that we could not start a new year without his approval. But you know enough about him to know that nerds would not know him...what if Dick Clark discovered Clark's method of inverse relations?To answer your question and to those who do not understand the correlation, I will summarize:Dick Clark is the manipulator. He has been holding Bitcoins back this whole time.He got in early and drove it down when it got to $32. He has been manipulating ever since.A recent interview after New Year's quotes he was asked what his new year's resolution was. It was to destroy Bitcoin, as was last year's. As has been said many times before.Bitcoin price is a good indicator of Google trends for keyword "bitcoin".Use this powerful knowledge wisely... I have been thinking about this idea more and would like some suggestions on how this could be done in an automated way without the need to have too much trust between co-investors.It may just need to be separated out at different levels but have everything centralized. That way you can have a one stop location for wholesalers, distributors, retailers, etc. All paying in BTC. I wrote a computer program to run through a game of roulette over and over using the doubling method starting with a million bucks on a $5 minimum. It would go up for a while then BAM...hit a huge losing streak and lose it all.I think of it like an opposite lottery. Take $175 million and bet on a number. If the number does not hit, then you win a dollar. If it hits, you lose it all. Sure, odds are that you will probably win that dollar, and win it many times. But there is always that chance that the number hits and you lose it all. And at the casino, the odds are in favor in the house. I vote for all three choices. You can think of MintChip as a monkey while Bitcoin is like a gorilla.Only the gorilla has a hat on. And the monkey is missing an arm.But the monkey can play the drums. He plays for Def Lepard.But the gorilla is on Broadway and is a huge hit.And the monkey can read sign language but has difficulty signing because of only having one arm.The catch though...the gorilla is actually a man dressed in a gorilla suit. And the monkey is his pet.That about sums it up. Here is how you use Bitcoinica.You put a huge margin and a lot of money into which way you think (and as it should) the market is headed.A lot of small trades by regular Bitcoin traders moves you into that direction and you come close to the break even mark waiting to start making money.Then, as Bitcoinica sees a bunch of people all margined out in one direction, Bitcoinica buys or sells a buttload of BTC on MtGox and the price either spirals down or skyrockets to a new price which you can not maintain because of the huge spread and margin.You lose your Bitcoin.Bitcoinica profits.The price eventually makes its way back to where it should have been because the market intervenes. Shoot the moon! In my opinion it would be best to influence all of those people between you and him to use Bitcoins. People like your friend, his godson, other people who regularly interact with him.Go for the most likely users, maybe e-mail them a few Bitcoins to spend as a birthday gift. I see...so they could flood the network with fee-less transactions back and forth between their own addresses but it would take so long because of lack of fees that it would not be possible to flood it to the point of harm.That is good to know, I am sure that as regular transactions take up hard drive space over time the hard drives will grow at a fast enough rate where it will not have much affect. I am by far no expert on the inner workings of Bitcoin but I have wondered about ways in which an outside entity (The Federal Reserve) may try to take down Bitcoin.I do know that all transactions are stored in the chain. And also that you can get as many addresses as you want. I see these as potential weaknesses against an attack.For the first one, I may be off but when you download the Bitcoin app you are also downloading all transactions that have taken place right? (I may be way off there). But if someone wanted to attack, they would just create millions of dummy transactions back and forth between two addresses so that the size of the download would get so huge that nobody would be able to load up the client because of the hard drive space needed. Again, I may be way off on how that works but it seems that hard drive space could potentially be an issue if someone went about it right.As for the BTC addresses, yes I know that there are billions (trillions?) of addresses, but could someone not set up thousands of bots to just keep creating addresses at a speed where they own all BTC addresses after a few years? What is preventing this from happening?Those are my major concerns. I know that there are major forces out there that do not want Bitcoin or anything like it to succeed, and we are probably off the radar for now as a "currency for trading drugs" but if/when Bitcoin becomes a competitor, we will be attacked. So, the left side of mtgoxlive is filled with false walls? This.The reason it is called the TEA PARTY is because it was based off of the Boston Tea Party where they tossed Tea into the Boston Harbor in protest of the British tax on Tea.What part of the celebration of that act promotes anything but a protest against taxes and a tyrannical government? Obama WILL get a second term because Ron Paul supporters and true Tea Party patriots know that Mitt Romney is no different from Obama and will be voting for neither.No One But Paul! They do not see it.The price to pay for their ignorance?4 more years of Obama.  Bitcoin is definitely not yet ready for prime time when it comes to large companies where several people have access to the money with no paper trail if it goes missing.
I am going to inject a million dollars into Bitcoin in order to get the price to $250 just in time.Then I will celebrate my 2 BTC victory!!! It does mean that there will be more spending and potential hyperinflation.Having your money in Bitcoin or gold or anything non-USD makes sense. So, it appears that Obama will be winning a second term.How do you believe this affects Bitcoin over the next 4 years? Honest assessment. A lot of up and down through the summer, a lot of second guessing and jumping around going up until the end of 2013 when mining pay out halves, then a steady climb up with some drops followed by steady climb to 50 by 2014. The Bitcoin price is about to go without people shorting for a while...Price spike inevitable. Or maybe...the day is not yet over When I was in Iraq it was sort of a joke to bet someone 10 bucks on something. The joke being that as defense contractors we were making a couple hundred thousand each so $10 meant very little, but the fact that we were in Iraq and the actual cash out there is very limited, mainly limited to the cash you brought with you. So 10 real dollars meant a bit of effort. Even worse if they said the bet would be in real change (they actually pay your change in little round cardboard tokens at the stores because the weight of shipping change would be too much effort).Maybe Bitcoin could fill a void of people who make a lot of money but have difficulty using it. I know I ran into trouble when my girlfriend was getting a new apartment for us and I had over $50k in my bank account but it did her no good standing in front of the apartment guy (with no access to my account). I had to go to the only military bank and withdraw the maximum $300 per day and then Western Union the money to her over the course of a few days to get the deposit taken care of.I am not sure what hole that Bitcoin could fill, but I plan on going back out there and will look into using Bitcoins in the best way possible. Any news outlets lined up for the event? The answer is likely in this:Sequent SoftwareandSequent Computer Systems Not only did he ok it.He encourages its use by discouraging the use of the US dollar (by decreasing its value): http://www.cnbc.com/id/46571276 You could always ask:contactus@sequent.com From the looks of it, IBM merged with sequent back in '99 in order to get some hardware for their thin clients. IBM has since sold off their PC line to Lenovo.Not that it is relevant, but I work for IBM. No inside info though...just google. Compare 1BTC to 1 oz Silver.Total silver in the world is 45,000,000,000 (45 billion).Max amount of BTC will be 20,000,000 (20 million).Currently silver is about 37 USD per oz.That equals $1,665,000,000,000 (1.6 trillion)If 1BTC were to become as popular as 1oz of silver at the max amount of BTC supply, it would be worth $83,250 per BTC. This.Buy a lot of bongs and weed and blow your mind. When I first checked out Second Life, the Linden dollar was at about 2 Linden Dollars per USD.Looking at how the whole thing worked I knew that they would be making their money by devaluing their currency.It is currently around 250 Lindon Dollars per USD.Why would they give up all of that free money?Might as well ask the Federal Reserve to replace the dollar with BTC. Perhaps a good step for stores would be to pay all change (excluding bills) in Bitcoins.This would be useful as the government tries to find cheaper metal for our devalued currency.Just pay the cash then scan the customer QR code on a keychain. Paypal is susceptible to chargebacks.I will preface this by saying that I have paid PayPal back and that no illegal intent took place.So, I do not know how it happened, but one day I noticed that $1,000 was being transferred from my linked bank account to PayPal.The funds had already left my account leaving me with -$400 in my account. I freaked. I immediately called PayPal and told them I did notauthorize the transaction. I then went to my bank and told them that the transfer was not authorized nor initiated by me.They both went into fraud checking mode to see what happened. Paypal came back a day later saying that everything was legit, that it was me who did the transfer. I went to my local bank and told the lady that there was no way that I transferred money which would have left me in the negative.That day, my PayPal showed a balance of $1,000. I immediately began the transfer back to my bank. The next day my bank reversed the original $1,000 and waved my overdraft fees.A day later the $1,000 from PayPal showed up in my bank account.My PayPal account then showed a -$1,000 balance and my account was then locked.So, essentially I could have taken the money from my bank and spent it and said screw PayPal (they would have sent me to collections though).I got a call from PayPal and I took care of the negative balance.What I suspect originally happened was my wife was buying something online and through a series of bad clicks, initiated the $1,000 transaction. She has no clue how to transfer money so I still do not know how it happened. tl;dr You can get money out of PayPal by transferring money then telling your bank it was a false transfer. Finally ended my short from 5.6 at 5.2.Tried to buy back big at 5.2 but the * would not go away until just now at 5.36.There is plenty of room for it to climb at this point.And people will be getting money in their accounts tomorrow. Agreed.Nobody manipulate Bitcoins! Everyone just trade what you need when you need it for purchases!Then one day cascius or bit-pay need 100,000 BTC for some project they are working on or an investment into a new technology and the price skyrockets to $1,000/BTC as they have to pay whatever people ask for with such a limited supply at the exchange. Consider this scenario:An oil well estimated to yield 10 billion gallons of oil is found off of the coast of Texas.Oil traders hear about this and immediately start selling their shares of oil with the knowledge that the extra supply will lower the price of oil in the long term.As they sell, the price of oil drops.As the price of oil drops, gasoline prices drop.You benefit by paying less at the pump for gas.This, from not a drop of oil being extracted.Would you forbid this type of speculation from happening?
The low has constantly been just outside of my profitability for my short.Last week I was waiting for it to fall below 5.4, this week 5.58...it teases me right above each time If you feed the monster, it grows larger and is harder to move.It jumped in June to $30 because there were a small amount of people throwing in some money.Now it is harder to have such huge jumps because there are more people in the market throwing in their money.The same market exists for gold. You can subscribe to newsletters telling you which way gold is headed. The only difference is that a lot of people own gold so the result is not so dramatic.If you do not like the manipulation, encourage more people to come and manipulate for their own gain. How do I sign up for this market predictor that rises and falls based upon the e-mail sent out?Sounds like an e-mail a friend of mine was signed up for with stock advice. He would wait for the e-mail to say what stock would go up or down, then he would immediately buy or sell. Then everyone else who received the e-mail would do the same and he would buy or sell at a slight profit.I like profit. Please point me to this source of profit. means BUY!!!! Interesting thread about USDcoins earlier. Basically a crypto coin pegged to the dollar right? Seems like this strategy would be correct for about 90% of that chart.Which means that it should drop again this weekend. Quite honestly, I do not believe that Bitcoins are ready for corporations that have accountants and accounting software. As much as I support any business using Bitcoins.Likely your boss accepts checks for payment which costs no money. I doubt there are credit card purchases at that level.If he is accepting credit cards for any part of his business, then bit-pay is certainly a viable option.If there are large purchases over long distances (wire transfer, etc) then Bitcoin is a viable alternative.If your boss has ever had to deal with a chargeback then he may be interested in Bitcoin as a solution for that. WOO HOO!!!TO THE MOOOON!!!! 7 weekends down, 6 weekends up...unambiquous So you are basically saying:Sell highBuy lowThen use the money you make to buy BTC long if you like Bitcoin.Insanity! I was premature in my prediction, now it will TAKE OFF!!!woo hoo!!! edit I would like to see an exchange that also allows the trade of currencies. I like to think that this thread gave the market a slight push to make things exciting again.It was better than the thread titled "yawn"...I am bullish long, but enjoy the wild back and forth in the mean time. I must have missed this.What does the * mean? I will be buying 50,000 Bitcoins in the next hour.Sporadically.Get in or lose. BUY BUY BUY!!! Here it goes!!!UP UP UP!!!Where it stops, nobody knows!!! SELL SELL SELL!!!This is the end of Bitcoin!!!.0001 here we come!!! BTC is falling like a rock!!!Everyone out now!!!
Perhaps I should have been more clear. That is a combined years experience.178 people with .5 years experience.That is a lot of experience though. Careful analysis and 89 years of experience leads me to believe that Bitcoin is about to go through the roof.Though most will not understand the dynamics of what this chart shows, those that do will be blown away.You heard it here first. If I were the manipulator I would go to wikileaks with as many memos from my bosses to expose the banker's plot to destroy Bitcoin. I was thinking at this point more along the lines of Bitcoin businesses like MtGox, Tradehill, Bit-Pay, etc may want to advertise on them.These coins will last for a long long time... So, is this saying that you can verify that your vote was counted but not what your vote was? I was just wondering if any of the physical Bitcoin makers had thought of the idea of using advertisements on their physical Bitcoins to cover the manufacturing cost of the coin itself.Some company may be willing to pay some decent money to have their company website or logo on a coin that will be passed around for a long long time... Sending .00000001 BTC would not be much of a loss. You could have a full nationwide election and only lose 1 BTC. This adds 1BTC worth of value to the rest of the Bitcoins in use.And the divisibility can always be extended down the line as has been brought up numerous times. While I love the idea of being able to verify your vote...it has not been verifiable for a reason.The ability to verify your vote opens the door to being able to prove that you voted one way or another.Being able to prove that you voted one way or another opens the door to someone paying you to vote one way or another and then being able to show proof that you did so.Or even worse, a government with enough power to have a vote and then "check" to make sure you voted "correctly".The ideal voting machine is an open source software that allows you to vote in the voting booth, then get an easily read receipt showing clearly how you voted. You take that receipt over to a box and you put that receipt into the box.You have an electronic vote that is cast with a back up ballot box that can verify that vote.Sure, you may say "paying someone to vote is illegal" and try to fix the problem there. But tampering with votes is already illegal, so why would you need to come up with a better system if you trust the law to take care of such things? ERMA appears to be a networking site for various placement agencies and companies. It looks like they are trying to standardize the methodology of it.It costs $350 for membership giving access to the community.Or you can go directly to a placement agency. Good idea, I was thinking a bit along those lines for a local website that allows merchants to exchange the currency. Even though it is actually just another BTC exchange at BTC/dollar rates.Once the currency catches on the transition to actual Bitcoin would be easy for locals. Check out this site for resources on product placement.http://www.erma.org/productsearchPerhaps a donation page can be set up to try to get Bitcoin into another TV show or movie.  Whhhhaaaa???!!!!??!?  Theoretically...Prove to me that humans seek pain and avoid reward. Was this show supposed to be on tonight? Did anyone see it? Bitcoin will end hunger and poverty.Bitcoin will empower the people over their governments thus allowing for people to succeed in the absence of the oppression brought on by force of tyrannical government control which is empowered by creating power/money out of thin air. You may want to add something about how divisible it is.... I would love to have a coin and bill based currency localized to my town where the idea caught on that using the money locally would spur the local economy and keep the spending local.Perhaps casacius types of coins and bills with the town name on it to give locals a sense of pride in using it.It could be introduced at the local chamber of commerce and merchants could be encouraged to use it.Then maybe have some drawings paid in USD and the winner wins a set amount of local BTC bills to spend at local merchant locations.There is a radio show I listen to that holds caller raffles and the winner gets "JB bucks" to spend at local merchant locations who also donate a few bucks each week toward the promotion. In other words...loud ignorant guy scares off three peoplethen loud guy comes back less ignorantthree people still scared off I was going through a drive through behind a nice car with a tag that mentioned the guy went to law school. When it was time to pay he flipped the card to the guy in a way that was if to say "I have the super platinum high roller card". He was obviously impressed by himself and his fancy credit card.This would actually be a good way to get things rolling if it could catch on. Make paying with Bitcoin something reserved for the elite such as having an American Express black card.Then when you pay with Bitcoin and someone sees it they will have the obvious question of "what is this Bitcoin thing and how do I get my hands on some?"One way to push this would be to have a Bitcoin company that buys some of the most exclusive things (front row concert tickets, high end tech, penthouse suites, etc...) then have them only available for purchase with Bitcoins. The Bitcoin price has always been a good way to determine the future google trends...
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57303.0The perfect tool for getting anyone to start using Bitcoins. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UmynaPg8hw Perfection.Anyone can accept Bitcoins as payment now.You guys have the BTC acceptance down pat.If we could get to the point where it is that easy to convert dollars to BTC it would be revolutionary. There is also the announcement that bit-pay will be allowing people to buy Bitcoins at the CES trade show using credit cards.They will need to buy a large amount of bitcoins in order to ensure that they have enough for the show.That is one place where they are going.I had personally jumped out a long time ago when it crashed below $4. I jumped out because I was setting up a buy around $1.I jumped back in because I knew that there was enough going on that the price was primed for a possible jump the likes of June's $30 rally. Sold at $7.20I figured that all of the new activity would bring in the weekend lull as new investors get the realization of no new money coming in while the banks are closed.It usually picks up again Monday toward the end of the business day. Hence the comparison.Ron Paul does not want to take us "back" to something in the 19th century, he wants to take us FORWARD to something BETTER based on the principles which were usurped.Ron Paul does not want to take us "back" to the gold standard. He wants to take us FORWARD to competing currencies which would include Bitcoin and all sorts of currencies that all compete to fill their own niches. You cannot legislate morality.Morality is different to all people. What is this "Beanie Babies" you speak of and where can I get many???I will pay top dollar! With Bitcoin being represented at CES, the TV show bringing up Bitcoin and the software updates I can see this going up to $10 by the end of the month.  176 board members are using Bitcoin!!!!WOOOOO HOOOO!!!! This is like saying that Bitcoin is a bunch of gold bugs trying to bring back something that never worked in the first place. Anyone who is under 30 and does not support Ron Paul either A. has not done their research orB. not really under 30(most people over 30 have resolved to the fact that the government is their master and there is nothing to do to stop it) $250.31008I will hunt you down if you do not come through with your promise of 2 BTC. We tried to hash out how to get Ron Paul to accept Bitcoins a while back and came to the conclusion that the possibility of some foreigner donating a buttload to a US campaign is just too simple with Bitcoin since you have no idea of who the donor is.Even donating directly to RevPAC would require some proof that you are not a foreigner. I have an idea on a software application for paying someone cash for Bitcoins.The scenario would be, you both open up your exchange app, you both authorize the exchange of the same amount. The application starts transferring Bitcoin for cash in the smallest increments possible (ie a penny at a time). If at any time in the transaction a penny is sent and the equivalent BTC is not paid, the transaction is terminated. So the most you could lose during a transaction with someone is a penny. The cash exchange part could be made up of many different cash transferring medium such as Dwolla, etc.  The key being that money transferred between users is not charged on a per-transaction basis (otherwise it is a non-starter).What do you think? Could this work? Am I missing something? They could find 50 million barrels of oil tomorrow and the oil price would go down. Even with not one drop of oil drilled for years.So, knowing that Bitcoin will stabilize a year from now should stabilize it now.You always hear things about how the "speculators" are ruining gas prices because they drive the prices up. But you do not hear about how speculators are terrible when a new oil field is discovered and the price of gas goes down. That is how speculation works. You look at how things are going to be in the future and you fix the price to that predicted value. One thing that may help Bitcoin take off would be a coupon book for discounts at stores that take Bitcoins. I saw a coupon book for sale for $5 with a bunch of great deals. I have purchased books for as much as $20 knowing that I would be able to get half off at some decent places. A coupon book where you get the discount when you use Bitcoins may be a decent thing to try out.Also, to get local Bitcoin use going, a Groupon type of setup would be decent. The way Groupon works is that you pay up front for a local service at a considerable discount. The retailer gets paid up front and honors the vouchers. This could easily be done in Bitcoin. Even for businesses that do not accept Bitcoin. I would have thought that he was smart and manipulating to make money...but after watching long enough, he drives the price down over and over...most often keeping it low before vanishing again After a nice quiet weekend of slow increase in price, the manipulator is back.With huge bid walls and fluctuating prices.Get ready for the price to drop. That is the mission of "the manipulator". I was driving down the road and I saw a "Western Union" sign and thought...why do we still have those places around?Bitcoin could easily replace Western Union all over the world. You just become a Bitcoin exchanger in your store and if someone wants money transferred they just go to an exchanger and send their money to the recipient's Bitcoin address. You go to one of any exchangers and exchange your BTC for your currency and you are all set. The exchangers could charge a fee that is cheaper than sending a wire transfer. Then bam...good-bye Western Union.Am I missing something here? I am far from a bear and want Bitcoin to shoot up to $100/BTC but have seen time and time again that on long holiday weekends when people cannot get deposits into their Dwolla accounts until the following Monday, the price drops throughout the long weekend, further than an average weekend.It dropped quite a but over 4th of July weekend, Labor Day weekend and even over Columbus Day weekend. Those were 3 day weekends.With Thanksgiving, it will be 4 days with no deposits.How low do you think Bitcoin will fall?
Who could possibly want to hurt Bitcoin? Only a small portion of the Bitcoin pie is traded on the exchange. If a large chunk (say $500k) is used just for manipulation, it manipulates the whole currency worth over $10 million. A 3 level p2p retail distribution system. All transactions made in Bitcoin.Level 1 - wholesale bulk purchase coordinationLevel 2 - shipping and receivingLevel 3 - retail salesWhat does this mean? You create a p2p to support all three levels. Level 1: Everyone runs a program on their computer. It has an input for a wholesaler with prices. People click on products they are willing to invest in, with a desired return on their investment in time and percentage. Once enough people invest in an item and a bulk order is reached, the purchase is sent through and it goes on to Level 2.Level 2: Someone with storage space pulls up a program and allocates amount of space along with length of time for storage and price for shipping and handling. Products from Level 1 are shipped to the person to hold until product needs to be shipped as part of Level 3.Level 3: Pull up the program and see what is for sale. You add those items to your website taking into account percentage of return on investment for Level 1, cost of shipping and handling for Level 2 and whatever profit you want from the sale. You sell the item, send off payment to Level 1 investor and send off details and shipping and handling fees to Level 2.At full success, this allows for lower prices and faster shipping as more distribution centers pop up all over the country. See: cheaper than Walmart. The selling pattern is not that of someone who wants to make money, but of someone who purposefully wants the price of Bitcoin to go down.Someone who had a lot of Bitcoin that they would want to maximize their profits from would sell at times when people have money in their Dwolla/MtGox accounts that could put money into BTC to buy up their coins.Instead they do huge sells on Sunday night/Monday morning when people have gone all weekend without having their accounts re-upped with cash.Someone wanting maximum return would also sell in small quantities in order to avoid panic selling before they can get the maximum amount from their sales.The person who currently has a $50,000 wall at $2.10 is the person driving the price down. Give name and address of seller to the buyer. If not satisfied...seller's house gets burned to the ground.Problem solved.  The only thing "the manipulator" wants is for the price to go down. There is no profit motivation in the way that he sells.He sells on Sunday night/Monday morning knowing that most MtGox accounts do not get filled after the weekend until Monday evening.If it was someone wanting to drop their BTC they would wait until during the week and drop in small portions when the price is high and people have cash in their accounts.Makes me think of something someone mentioned where they had a conversation with an NSA friend of theirs who said that Bitcoin would be gone in 2 years. The government already does market manipulation, they would not need much to destroy Bitcoin from a financial perspective. Perhaps a Bitcoin infomercial would be better.20-30 minutes giving people a step by step way of going from non-Bitcoiner to full knowledge of how to use Bitcoins. Why have no exchanges set up a Person2Person payment? You can transfer your money from your ING account to anyone else's ING account and get the money instantly.Was this tried or checked into and people had a bad experience? You can buy my house for 100k BTChttp://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS247&q=6744+Seaview+Blvd,+Hudson,+FL&gs_upl=64l4641l0l4920l26l26l0l24l24l0l152l210l1.1l2l0&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x88c29b6e2af1b55d:0x296ff0599969204b,6744+Seaview+Blvd,+Hudson,+FL+34667&gl=us&ei=0pu6Ts3BKejk2QWwlpG4Bw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA People smart enough to use Bitcoins are also smart enough to not need to pay for porn. This would need to be addressed. SilkRoad will do for Bitcoin what porn did for VHS (and the Internet). But on a much smaller scale. I agree, starting out would have to be fairly narrowed down as far as products and wholesalers go since if you had 10 retailers all choosing 10 different items from 10 different wholesalers it would defeat the purpose of bulk purchasing.I guess there are several different levels here. One would be the purchasing side from the wholesaler and the other would be the distribution side and perhaps a third being the actual sales and marketing.A p2p type of network for each of those levels could be a huge benefit.Person A may see an order of 1000 Blue Nikes going through at $20 each with a retail value of $50 and want to do nothing but invest in 100 Nikes paying $2,000.Person B may have a storage unit with enough room for 100 Blue Nike boxes so he makes his storage and shipping costs available for those 100 Blue Nikes.Person C may be a retailer with a website that puts Blue Nikes on his website for $50 plus $10 shipping and handling.A shoe sells, Person A gets $30 (the original $20 plus $10), Person B gets $10 for storing and $10 for shipping and handling, Person C gets $10 for selling the shoe.Each level can have numbers showing a level of trust and perhaps a competing percentage they are willing to take.The consumer gets decent prices with lower shipping if there are enough distribution centers spread out across the country with the product. My wife buys clothing wholesale from several sites. Each wholesaler gives lower prices for larger orders.How much interest would people have in a website that sifts through wholesale sites, grabs pictures and prices of items and then presents them to Bitcoin retailers that can "pre-order" items and have those pre ordered items show up higher on the list or on the main page and when a certain amount is reached a purchase is sent off and the items are divied up.For example, we have a shoe category. A pair of blue Nikes gets a lot of interest and moves up toward the top. Retailers seeing that the Nikes could be purchased cheap jump on the order. 100 Nikes are "pre-ordered" and those interested are given a day to purchase (send in their BTC).Once the Nikes arrive, the site owner sends them off to the retailers individually. Charging shipping and handling based on the size of the order. Since most wholesalers are overseas (see China), a huge shipment sent from a long distance split into smaller shipments locally would still be a decent deal.We could even have a common website for everyone and the person who lives closest to the buyer gets the money. That way the site gets known for fast shipping. Maybe even same day if a retailer is close enough.The ideal being that Bitcoin creates a new method of making money other than mining. Instead of a mining rig you get yourself a storage rig and just bring things in and store them and ship them out when needed.And hopefully the costs are all lower from combined orders and everything being paid in Bitcoin from there.Thoughts? (I thought it out better in my head than I described.) I notice on some prepaid debit cards that you can do a direct deposit to the card (http://www.creditcards.com/credit-cards/readydebit-visa-prepaid-card.php).You can also take out cash at an ATM.Bitcoin has the problem of chargebacks. If someone deposits cash into a BTC account and then gets the BTC and spends it, then does a chargeback...they can get their money back.Could you not use a prepaid debit card to transfer funds to it, take out the money at an ATM and do a chargeback?Or things like refillable gas cards that you can re-charge using a credit card (http://www.shell.us/home/content/usa/products_services/shell_cards/refillable/). I assume that you could fill the card with your credit card, pay for gas with it, then do a chargeback and they could not get the money out of it.I am not trying to find a way to get free money or gas through chargebacks, I am trying to figure out how these are used without having the same problem that BTC does with chargebacks. They are both white with red and green rectangles going up and down and black lettering...I agree. Quite similar. This goes without saying. I was referring to the day after winning the lottery...  I would probably put a huge bid wall up at $5/BTC and as people buy, sell at $5.50 for at least a year to give some price stability in the early stage. Such as? Let us say that you won the lottery and you want Bitcoin to succeed in the long term. You want to take some of your earnings, $10 million, and use it toward making Bitcoin a fairly popular and useful currency of choice.What would you do?
Let us say that you had a whole lot of Bitcoins or you were getting thousands of Bitcoins per week and wanted to set up your own personal exchange because you just do not want to go through the exchanges.How would YOU accept payment?Keeping in mind that people will likely try to scam you out of your BTC. We got served. It is the way that it goes down that is what appears to be manipulation.Large walls set up that then fall just as it is going down.Early adopters are not sitting on $100k to put up walls while also selling $100k worth of BTC. Even though I wish the price was up over $100/BTC I believe that the price will hover around $4 for a while.It is apparent with the easing of the mining difficulty that we dipped below profitability for some miners when we reached the $4 range. The "manipulator" drove the price down below $3 but it is slowly rising up to its real value.If current mining difficulty is steady, many miners will hold more than sell slowing the inflation rate. And if we can make it through to late 2012 then the blockchain reward will be cut in half and there will be an upward movement in price from there on out. Ya, I guess they do not even need to be considered BTC in the game. Maybe something that you can sell for BTC or whichever.That spring engine looks quite nice. Open source and everything. Just had an idea for a Bitcoin game....Similar concept. All items/upgrades/etc. in game are purchased and sold using Bitcoins. The Bitcoin client will be built into the game to ease the transfer of coins.The game will also include mining code into it to mine coins.It is basically a battle type of game where everyone is out for themselves, or they form groups or whatever they want.When the combined power of all of the miners discovers a block and gets 50 BTC it pops up in the game (or many coins separated are sent out). The coins fall closest to those who contributed the most GPU power.When the 50 BTC comes in, it is a free for all. Whoever can get to it first wins. You can fight others, coordinate with others, go lone wolf, etc. When you get the BTC, the server transfers the BTC to you. From there maybe you need to get back to your home base or whichever.It would be like pool mining but a game where playing a video game could actually make you money. This does not address the hard part of the exchange, which is exchanging currency for Bitcoin and vice versa.Setting the price in a decentralized manner is easy.If we had several exchangers that each wanted to run their p2p exchange, they just put in the current ratio for Bitcoins to dollars.You want to start an exchange, you put in the current ratio, $3 for every 1 BTC into your available trade amount.Say you have $30 and 10 BTC in your exchange. Someone wants to trade 1 BTC for $3. You send them the $3 and they send you 1 BTC. You now have $27 and 11 BTC. Your P2P system goes out to other exchanges and finds the best price to even out your ratio. You find the best one out there accepts $2.9 for 1 BTC. You trade 1 BTC with them and you now have $29.90 and 10 BTC. Then that other exchange goes out and tries to find the best deal to even its ratio and on and on. Each exchange could set up whatever transaction fee they want. When trying to locate the best ratio you also try to find the best transaction fee.But the hardest part is the actual exchange of currency for BTC. Dealing with Dwolla or Liberty dollar or banks or anything is more than an individual wants to deal with or is capable of. But that is the key to Bitcoin's success. An easy transfer from currency to BTC. Or just write a kick ass computer program that people want to have running 24/7 that will mine Bitcoins when not in use. I use this graph:_/\_   /\    _      \/   \/It has been accurate so far. I will repeat. On a public forum you say this:Of course. I report everything to the IRS. I am a good citizen. I love the IRS. They are a bunch of great guys that get a bad rap.BB w@tchz U Of course. I report everything to the IRS. I am a good citizen. I love the IRS. They are a bunch of great guys that get a bad rap.  Buyer really should bring a smartphone. Then you just use the Bitcoin app.Bit-pay is very handy if both have cell phones.The third party thing is no big deal since they send you either cash or Bitcoins at the end of the day. A documentary I watched showed that many Zimbabweans are using gold as their currency. Trading in small bits of gold, weighed in the market. The people go into these holes and dig for gold to survive. /\/\/\/\/\   /            \/? Ithaca New York, population 30,000.Ithaca Dollar: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_Hours (local currency) The best thing that a Bitcoin ATM can do is solve the fiat currency -> bitcoin problem.Right now, you have to take your bank money and send transfer it to some third party and wait for about a week. Then your money gets sent to an exchange where you can then exchange it for Bitcoins. You can then send from there to your wallet.With an ATM. Take your cash, insert it into the machine, transfer Bitcoin to your wallet.MtGox makes it slightly easier though. Now you can go to a Chase bank, fill out a deposit slip with all of the right info. Deposit the money, then get the Bitcoin in your account, then you can send it to your wallet.Though, in reality, you are basically trading currencies. If I want to trade my USD for EUR, it takes a few steps. I think a local currency such as the Ithica dollar would be good for any small community that wants to encourage local trade.Sure, it is a global currency but with it being so underutilized it will be practically as if it is a local currency.It would also benefit the community if mining was encouraged.It would be like a local community mining gold and using it for all of their transactions. I will be buying 7 million BTC at 1 dollar each. DDOS perhaps?https://secure.ronpaul2012.com/ All of the complaining about those who got rich on Bitcoins because they were in on it early can end now.We are all early adopters at this point. When it was at $17/BTC people were pining for the days when the price was $1-$2/BTC.People will look back on this price and wish again that they had bought at the dip. Bitcoin is here to stay, the technology is sound and has proven itself.If it is just the tiniest of chunks of the US dollar currency, it would need to be worth several thousand dollars per Bitcoin in order to sustain its use.With banks starting to charge just to make a transaction, their customers will seek alternatives.Bitcoin is that alternative.
Bitcoin is more robust and has more applications and technology associated with it than a year ago. That is all that matters.The price can be wherever it needs to be, but it all comes down to how much easier it is to use as a means of exchange. And as far as that goes...it has come quite a long way.The technology is sound. The blockchain has held on. Bitcoin will continue on for decades to come. Not for everyone...mining difficulty going down is a wonderful thing I do not see the steps that were in ExchangeB where you had to take a picture of your deposit slip or set up a pre-deposit.This will be huge. Converting dollars to Bitcoins has been the biggest obstacle. The more streamlined, the better. Who has electric and network bills on the same carrier? *pulls out my GPU miner* dictionary.comworld: the earth or globe, considered as a planet.manipulate: to manage or influence skillfully, especially in an unfair mannerThe only way to manipulate the globe would be through some sort of change in its trajectory or makeup.Whatever humans may do, the world will continue on its course.QED I comment because I think it is funny.I made this thread as a joke to make a point. I guess it went over people's heads. When I was in Iraq in 2005 the same rumblings were going on. An attack was imminent at that point too. Thinking out of the box here a little bit...A sweet phone app would be to have a Bitcoin wallet tied to your debit-card. The app would show your balance in BTC and in $.When you want to spend BTC you use the app to send a payment. If you want to pay in cash you transfer some money to the card and pay with the card.Of course, ideally the best thing would be if you could go from cash on the card to BTC. The price will fly past $32 by the middle of next week on its way to $1000/BTC where it will hold steady for about 2 years. 1/6th is based on the calculation done in this thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45977.msg548650 It would completely fill a niche if a major game in development used Bitcoins for their in-game currency. They already have exchanges set up for in game currencies. They might as well just use BTC and allow players to use it.Also, I used to play these strategy games on my phone that pretty much had the same theme. You work your vampire/mob boss/zombie/etc and he gets experience which he then uses to buy at token/diamond/gem/etc to get better stuff in the game. You could, of course, purchase more tokens/etc to advance quicker. Which is where they got their money.  But we could create an open source type of game like this where you need to spend BTC to get more tokens.Edit:I have created a Bitcoin Pool for anyone who wants to see something like this developed.Signing up is easy, you only need 10 mBTC to join the discussion (the 10 mBTC stays in your wallet).http://www.bitpools.com/?Video%20GameWith enough interest we can get something working. Let's do this.Here's an example of how it would work for developing a video game:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY Anyone who has a Bitcoin is part of that .1% of the world's population that holds Bitcoins.The true elite. Only about 1/6th of Bitcoins are located in the exchanges on a daily basis. So...you get a reloadable debit-card...do you load it with Bitcoins? Only a small percentage is traded on the exchange. That small percentage is where the price is set.It would be like me drawing a picture once per hour. I hand them out to my family members. Some hang them up, some stick it in a drawer somewhere, some give them to friends and one gets sold to a neighbor for $1.With me making new pictures every hour, the price of those pictures will not decline by $1 per hour. There will be no need to have at least $1 worth of buyers for every picture in order to maintain that price.I could give those pictures out to other family members or the same ones who put them up on more walls or toss them in the garbage and whatnot.  Or point out that their whole idea is moot because they use the product of some corporation."Well you wear clothing that is made by a corporation! What a hypocrite!"Similar to the argument I always hear about driving on the government roads whenever I complain about government. As if only a person who lives on an island can complain about the government. I still find it funny that this thread continues on.If you support democracy, then you should realize that this thread has already determined that democracy is a bad idea via a democratic vote.The majority has decided.  It already has...and it does not like you. My economics teacher in college mentioned that there is only one company in the United States that has a full on monopoly.That company is the company that creates the little white collar things for priests.
He cannot. But Obama can.It is time for the Bitcoin CEO to request a bailout.  This chart shows that I need to buy some more Bitcoin so that I am up there with the elite. There used to be a website called theobamaforum (it is still a domain but the real site taken down).The web host had to jump from hosting service to hosting service because the site basically revolved around calling out the Obama administration in a very satirical way that cut to the bone (lists for children to turn in their parents for not supporting Obama, a list of anti-Obama websites, talk of the wonders of socialism/communism and one world government, calling any dissenter a racist anti-semite, etc).It got hit by most hosting services because its controversial nature.Would such a site be able to go up and stay up under an anonymous hosting service? Even with letters from large lobbying organizations and cease and desist orders?The guy had the site hosted offshore but even they had to take it down due to the amount of heat they were running into.           ^        /    \                 ^      /        \             /    ---------------^    /            \          /   /                \____/my expert analysis There is a never-ending flow of entrepreneurs who wish to go into business for themselves, even if it means sinking their own money into it and losing it all.The biggest thing that helps big business and hurts small business is government stepping in and helping the big business by putting restrictions which the big established companies can suck up while the small companies cannot get past. As well as subsidies and favors for those big businesses. For garbage service, I saw one guy who had his own garbage company. He bought a truck that could hold 6 garbage cans in the back. He would go out in the morning, pick up the full garbage can and drop off an empty. Then go drop the garbage off at the dump.Even if he only did 6 houses per day, that is 180 houses a month times $10 each per month...$1,800 per month income just for owning a truck and making a garbage run every day. $2,600 per month if he makes two trips a day.A corporation could buy him out. Then the next guy would go out and buy a truck and do the same thing... And...everyone is forced to pay for fire service. Some people may not want the monthly option as I did not. Obviously not since my fire station gave me an option when I moved in.Pay $20 per month OR pay $2,000 to put out a fire when it happens.I opted to chance it and not pay the monthly fee.And the private fire station is still going strong with top ratings. If bitcoin dies then I will buy as much of it as I can and do all of the mining with my GPU at work for free.I will then start selling once all 21 million are mined. Everyone is born with inalienable rights.How quickly they are suppressed is another question. Using your imagination and using brain power to come up with solutions is a much better way than just fighting humanity, as tends to be the environmentalist solution. You cannot stop greed. The best you can do is direct it toward being beneficial.To try to fight greed only works with guns and oppression. Before Hawker responds, I figured I would help him out with this one.Hawker: But what about people who want to go out and fish? How can you keep boats out of the ocean? What if the Japanese Navy wants people to kill whales, there is nothing you can do about it. How are you going to stop people from going to the beach? People on beaches step on ocean creatures. How do you stop that? 80% of people live within 2 miles of the ocean, how will you keep them out of the water? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming It is great that you are coming up with all of these "holes" that nobody has considered with seasteading.But you may be enlightened to actually do some research to know that others too have considered it and look for ways at solving them.http://www.seasteading.org/search/node/defendingOf course, government is always the concern. Somalia is being stifled because of UN attacks. The answer to most threats of war is to trade peacefully with a nation and its citizens so that attacks would be unproductive and harm the nation doing the attacking as much as the one being attacked. Not sure, but I believe this service was discontinued.https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=253.0Perfect opening for someone else to step in. This. With bit-pay, a merchant does not need to know nor care anything about Bitcoins other than the fact that it is easy to set up (NO SETUP FEES), he can expand his customer base and that the transaction fees are cheaper.Most importantly, that he can get paid in cash just like with a credit card. I have acquired plenty of knowledge on free market environmentalism. What knowledge do you have of it? Perhaps you should acquire knowledge.A good start would be "Healing our World" by Mary Ruwarthttp://www.ruwart.com/Healing/chap8.html The whales would probably not be conducive to nets, but fish would...and they do already as the story posted shows.For whales, GPS would be an option.The tragedy of the commons is that, without ownership then it is a free for all. First one to get it all wins. With no consequences.This is the same with the government leasing out timber land and other natural resources to be bleed dry with no considerations for the future use of that land. If someone actually owned it, they would want the value to continue forever. And you would rather treat humans like cattle instead? Or perhaps sheep?
To be clear...are you saying that the use of force by a government against someone that has not initiated force against that government is a bad thing? You were asking about saving the whales...Last time I checked the cattle population has done nothing but climb...at around 1.3 billion as of 2009.Such growth at even 1 millionth through property rights would be worth it. Wow, I have been called out.  The article I quoted is speaking of harvesting fish. Nets are not a new concept in fish farming.http://www.badinotti.com/news.html That is the key issue? Really? If a small community evolves in an area of the sea and creates an economy based upon harvesting and herding fish/whales, then they will be very resentful toward any ship coming into their proximity to steal their livestock.And they would have the incentive to encourage replication and growth of the fish and whale populations. While having the incentive to protect it. You seem to be completely unaware of the aesthetic quality of purpose built engineering that fulfills a need. There is already work being done on this. They refer to it as seasteading instead of homesteading. Same concept.There is a lot being put into this in an open sourced way. Here is an engineering report on seasteading:http://seasteading.org/files/research/TSI/engineering/Feb2011_Report_p1.pdf You can homestead a piece of the ocean in the same way that you can homestead a piece of land. You establish "residency" in a way that allows others to understand that you are the rightful owner. On land you have to clearly mark your territory and live there for a few years. There are plenty of ways with modern technology to mark your territory in the ocean. As for whales, just like cows, whales could be herded and sold in the same way. There would be a disincentive to let whales go extinct. Here is an article that addresses bluefin tuna: http://mises.org/daily/4879"If people owned portions of the ocean, then the bluefin tuna would become as ubiquitous as cattle."As for the fish or whales traveling from property to property: It does not appear from the video that there is any early adopter holding a huge amount of Bitcoins. Why are people saying that Satoshi has 20,000 BTC held up that he could dump at any time?According to this video there are no huge spikes early on in the blockchain:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q3UtmhR9G8 Part of the problem. Bitcoin would make for a great local currency.If local people all accept Bitcoins, then they will tend to spend it locally. This would encourage people spending on local businesses helping the community to grow.See:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_Hours Definitely, this is why I said it needs to work like Bitcoin.It does not necessarily need to be built into the client. A separate exchange client should work.  I e-mailed Netflix No reason they would have much difficulty accepting BTC for subscriptions. I will type slowly so that you understand.Your dog is your property. If someone shoots your dog, they will be held legally liable.With no public land then all animals in the world are someone's property. Any harm to someone else's property will be held legally liable.Do I need to type slower?   As for the free rider thing....perhaps you missed the part where I received a letter in the mail that said "pay $20" per month or pay per service.So if your house is on fire but you did not pay your monthly fee they will put the fire out. Then you get a bill for $2,000 which is covered by insurance.Sure, you could say that that is not very free because they force you to pay even if you do not want it.As for your example of a bunch of houses next to each other.There was recently a news article about someone who did not pay for the fire service. This is what happened:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39516346/ns/us_news-life/t/no-pay-no-spray-firefighters-let-home-burn/"No Pay, No Spray"personally, I would have allowed the guy to promise to make the $2,000 payment if he really wanted it put out...but a fire company can let a house burn...And just a personal FYI...if your house is on fire beyond just a simple kitchen fire...let it burn to the ground. The cost to clean up and fix your house is more than just clearing out some rubble and starting from scratch. And you get the full amount of insurance if it is completely destroyed. I am not thinking that the POS part is as big of a deal as the accounting portion.You have a day's worth of customers paying in Bitcoins going into a wallet and you have to trust an employee somewhere not to access that wallet and copy it onto his home computer. That end of things needs some work.Right now it is ideal for a small business with a single owner. I do believe that large companies will need some software that would help them deal with Bitcoins.I am not saying that it is impossible to create that software, but that the software has not yet been developed because we are not at that level yet. I will contact my local Federal Reserve bank...*fingers crossed*
Ok, I have been thinking on this a bit more.The money account side of the equation could actually be dynamic over time.It could be set up so that most of the "miners" have several different means of holding or transferring money. Whether it is through Dwolla, Paxum, Libert Dollars, whichever. They would link up with another miner who has the same money service and exchange money that way.Thoughts? The manipulator is back!!!But this time instead of buying a shitload of Bitcoins then selling them making the price go all screwy...he is messing with us by making sure that the price is VERY stable...Man this guy is diabolical! Many of these games charge you money to get "coins" or "gold" or whichever game currency they use.They could charge the same and use Bitcoins as the game currency. http://tampa.craigslist.orgSearch: BitcoinResults:Sep 29 - Coin Operated Stainless Steel Car Vacuums (5) Accepting BitCoin - $300 (South Tampa (by IKEA)) barter picSep 21 - Gortex Jacket DCU Desert Combat Uniform - $40 (Dale Mabry) clothing & accessories picSep 21 - BDU's Woodland Camouflage - $10 (Dale Mabry) clothing & accessories picSep 19 - Bitcoin Miners - $3000 (Clearwater) computers & techSep 18 - Microwave w/ Rotating Plate, White // Sunbeam - $20 (Element Highrise (Downtown Tampa)) household items picSep 17 - ***********FREE BELT!

It is a lot different from having $9,940 psychologically even though that is only $60. How soon do you believe that chickens will go extinct? How about cows?They could be... http://seasteading.org/ It is better that there is no human face to Bitcoin. That is what they are trying to do.If you can put a face to Bitcoin you can slander that face and create guilt by association for anyone who uses Bitcoins."Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created by a sexual deviant, is getting a lot of attention lately""Bitcoin, a hair brained scheme devised by a man with a history of deception, has been growing in popularity among unsuspecting investors."etc. So if your idea does not win a majority vote then you must improve your idea? And if you do not win a majority of votes...does that mean that your idea is not good? What would happen if someone came into your back yard and killed your dog? Would you have legal ramifications?What if someone came into your waterway and killed one of your whales? Depends on how the property owner wants to treat the species on his land/waterway. Anyone introducing something that disrupts the wildlife on the person's land/waterway would be held responsible for the introduction of a harmful species. Because you do. Not unless you want to go against the majority. Which would be un-democratic. Here is the trailer, check it out:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tw15aK9NxQHere is the full feature film:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tScuHwVtRcY Then you do not give a rat's ass about what the solutions are.The problems are corporations being allowed to pollute our environment under the protection of our very own government.Brief history lesson.Back in the day when property rights were actually followed and pollution just started to kick in people started going after these polluters that were encroaching on their property rights.This was also back in the day where you called a private detective to solve your crime issues and not the government (remember the old PI movies?). Just as there were private detectivesthat would hunt down murderers or thieves, there were private detectives that would hunt down the source of pollution. They would find the source, the land owner would sue the companyand the company owner would be prosecuted rightfully for property rights violations and the property owner would be compensated.Around this time, pollution detectives were starting to catch on getting more and more popular.The companies that were polluting did not like this one bit. How could they produce anything with no pollution? So they went to their friendly government officials to save them from theselaw suits.The government stepped in and decided to create "standards" and "guidelines" for pollution which essentially made it so that you could not sue a company if they were adhering to these guidelinesand the fines paid by the companies would go to the government to do with as they pleased. A nice little quid pro quo between corporations and government.The private pollution detectives fell by the wayside and an industry was destroyed. The EPA became the protector of polluters and we have what we have now.So, when you say you do not want to hear about property rights and you want solutions...you are basically saying that you only want to hear the solution that best fits your social agenda. No.It is fair to say bitcoins are worth $5.orBitcoins are worth 5 bucks.But it is not fair to say bitcoins are worth $5 bucks.  Voting has ended.Democracy is a bad idea: 11 votesDemocracy is not a bad idea: 9 votesIf you like democracy then you must accept the outcome. There should no longer be any support of democracy on this forum because it has been determined a bad idea by the majority.Q E D The solution lies in property rights.But that does not fit into the game plan of "what can we use to get people to accept socialism..." Nobody subscribes to the New Yorker. They are just given out freely to be placed in dentist and doctor waiting rooms. Call me when the solution to the environment is NOT socialism.
There is no requirement for 100% consensus. Try again. I doubt most merchants would want a second machine just for Bitcoin. Why spend $250 for another machine when you could just have Bitcoin capability on your cell phone for free?It needs to be integrated or it will not be used. I understand the difficulties in doing so. Someone should be able to come up with something. In the general election Republicans fall behind the Republican and Democrats fall behind the Democrat.It is the independents that choose the president.His hardest election will be the Republican primary which he is now polling in 3rd place behind a fake Tea Party that is parroting his talking points but has no record to back it up and against a liberal Republican who changes his stance on everything every day. Alternative system offered which would be fairer:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46130.0 You have obviously not read the full OP, otherwise you are just trolling.Come back after you have read it. The system is a method of voting for how money is spent. Not on how things are done.The only enforcement power within the system is the distribution of funds. That is tied to Bitcoins and cannot be corrupted. Jackson's opponents used the nickname of "Jackass" to demean Jackson. He went with it. That is why the Democrat Party mascot is a jackass. Whom will provide the protection? From whom? Also this PPP Poll:"This may be the most positive poll for Paul that we've ever conducted- he leads by 15 points with independents (against Obama) even as the rest of the Republican candidates trail Obama with that voting group."http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/09/florida-close.htmlIt is the independents that choose presidents. He is beating Obama 51 to 49% in a national Harris poll.http://harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/mid/1508/articleId/870/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/Default.aspx. Ok, then what does that have to do with how a group votes on spending their own money? Why do I need to provide that? The market needs to be guided at the point of a gun.This is the moral way of doing things.  Not at all. And it is not a theory, it is a real thing in the real world. It does not have to be cheap, it has to be what property owners are willing to pay. Each house can have multiple owners, it does not matter.Are you completely ignoring the answer to this question that has been posted at least three times in this thread? Do not most buildings with separate owners pay association fees? Is the door man paid only by a few people? Is the upkeep of the building done by taxpayer money or through some sort of building fee? The fire fee can be paid in this exact same way.Someone would have to go out of their way as a building owner to not pay for fire service. The fire department even offers to charge you for the service call if you do not pay a monthly fee, which is covered under most insurance plans. And the private fire company was able to cut home insurance plan costs by 75%. Looks like  http://mtgoxlive.com/orders San Antonio is a good place for it. I would have suggested Vegas because it is a good destination spot and they tend to have cheap flights to encourage gambling.But I used to live in San Antonio and March is a good time of year. There is plenty to do in San Antonio as well for the tourists (river walk, Sea World, Six Flags, etc).You will certainly get quite a lot of Austin folks, you may also want to hit up the San Antonio Ron Paul meetup group, they were pretty huge and would probably be interested in Bitcoins. I do realize that they pay in USD, but the owner seemed like an American who opened a business down there. And she mentioned in her e-mail that "We dont like credit cards much (fees are outrageous from the IP address here in CR)". I agree, I tried to be as non-pushy as possible.
Well, according to liberals, with a majority of scientists saying that global warming is true makes it so.So if a majority of Bitcoin forum users believe that democracy is a bad idea, then it is. You must accept it. Laws must be put in place based on it. Taxes must be passed to deal with it. There are 10 people in the world. Those who understand Bitcoin and those that do not. The banks just make things easier for us.BofA is a gift to Bitcoins like Obama is a gift to liberty. Expensive fire trucks? So the Martinez fire department has cheap fire trucks?As for city housing of high rises, do they not have association fees? Every condo I have ever checked into has had those. I would assume that those fees could include fire prevention. With so many customers in such a small area you could get a lot of money from each building. Plenty for "expensive fire trucks".Or if it is just a building rental with tenants, it would be the building owner who pays the fees. My fees were $20 per month. With a building with 1000 condos that would be $20,000 per month going to the fire department. Plenty for any fire they may need to put out in that building. From the democratic vote, democracy is losing.Those who like democracy must accept that it is a bad idea.  You would likely not receive the benefits of whatever the group spends their money on.The system is purely voting on where money is spent. It has no enforcement power other than to spend money. Yes. The decision would be "grass". I am going on vacation in a month in Costa Rica so I started e-mailing local hotels and B&Bs asking if they accept Bitcoins or if they have never heard of them if they would check them out as I want to use Bitcoins for my trip.Most of my responses were along the lines of "We only accept credit cards or cash".I did get one response that said she had looked into Bitcoin and found it quite interesting, but that they were a new business and needed to have cash. I replied with a short message saying that bit-pay allows you to accept Bitcoin and have it automatically converted to cash, cheaper than a credit card. (this was yesterday, no response yet).So I was wondering...what if more people started e-mailing these merchants? If someone were to get an e-mail once a week or so from someone asking if they accept Bitcoins, they may give it some careful consideration.What if we put together an e-mail group or something where people offer up e-mails of places they would like to go spend their Bitcoins with a small description, then have several different people periodically send e-mails. Hotels, bars, restaurants, stores, websites, whichever. Maybe set up a program so that once someone e-mails a merchant the e-mail goes to the bottom of the list and does not come up until everyone else has been e-mailed (so they do not get 10 e-mails in one day asking about Bitcoins).These would be places that people would actually want to spend their Bitcoins, so it is not like the merchant would start accepting them and then nobody uses them.Thoughts? Holding steady at one price would be decent.At least the decline has been much slower. It used to fall about an average of one dollar a week. It has been hovering around this price for about 3 weeks.This means that we are just about at that point where enough interest is coming in weekly to make up for the inflation rate.If the price can hold steady long enough and maybe start to rise a bit with more use, then it is nothing but UP when the inflation rate is cut in half.  I usually say that Bitcoins are in that early stage known mainly by computer geeks. Kinda like the early days of the Internet. The spike in trading tends to lag at least a week behind big news as people figure out how to change their money into Bitcoins. Basic question. This will clear it up once and for all. Is Democracy a bad idea? I already covered that... Yes, people do tend toward greed. It is better to work in a system that is productive based upon this fact than try to fight it.If you have a group where the same guy keeps buying up the votes, the remaining members can EASILY drop the group and form their own. That is the point of this, it is very fluid. You stop paying dues and you are no longer a voting member. You do not like how the club is being run. Drop out and join one that you do agree with.The point of this is to have people join others with similar interests and goals and put their combined money toward those goals. On a voluntary basis. And if there is not agreement, the group will be slow to growth.And the solution that satisfies the most people in the group will always win. Because there will always be that delay to allow for better ideas that satisfy more people to be presented. With the goal of finding a solution that satisfies everyone. Why must the government run the non-profit?Here is the fire department I used to have:http://www.columbiacountyga.gov/index.aspx?page=4065 Though in Texas I did live in a few places that I could choose my electricity provider. I ended up choosing the windmill power company at one location.Worked out well because the other company had to burn gasoline when the capacity was maxed out which cost extra money for electricity at those times. And that was when gas was around $5 per gallon. The flat rate was higher than the other for the windmill company but it turned out to save me a lot of money.Choice...aint it grand? True. I am not a big fan of government created monopolies.With private roads they could run several separate systems under the roads to people's houses and charge each company rent for it. Thus allowing competition.I am actually going to run for commissioner of my local water company just to keep them honest.  If he did 10 BTC in commerce a day that involved someone transferring their dollars into BTC then that WOULD require the exchanges. If Adam has an apple tree and Lisa has an orange tree and they trade apples to oranges all the time. Then Joe offers $1 for one of the apples, all of the apples become worth $1. If Adam grows ten apples a day and continues to trade with Lisa for oranges but has 1 extra apple each day that he trades with Joe then the apple community needs $1 per day to maintain the current price. Even though he creates 10 apples per day, only 1 accounts for its dollar price. He does not need $10 per day to maintain the $1 price.If Joe and Tim show up and want that one apple, they might bid the price up to $2. He does not now need $20 per day in sales to maintain the $2 price.The dollar price is set on the portion of Bitcoins that are being traded for dollars. And that is currently 1/6th. Greece needs to crash in order to move forward. They have crashed already, they just need to acknowledge it to move on. Well, there is the caveat that there could be free education that is not socialist.Teachers could decide to voluntarily provide their services every day. Janitors could volunteer to take care of the school. Construction workers could volunteer to build the building. Donors could donate materials. Or someone could voluntarily give their money to pay for the school for the child's free education.Or the child can be home schooled.Otherwise someone has to pay. Or under socialism you steal money from someone and give it to the school.
It is as ok as just having a little bit of cancer. Sure it may not kill you, but most likely all of the bad things that are happening to your body are most likely related to the cancer.And then there is the fact that it has been known to grow. Free education for children is socialism. The Tea Party was started by Ron Paul supporters Dec. 16, 2007http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvGS12EoZUEThe whole point was that they were fed up with the establishment media ignoring Ron Paul and pushing their liberal choice, McCain.The groups continued as Obama brought in his health care scheme.Then the regular Republicans started showing up thinking that it was an anti-Obama protest. Not understanding where it all started. Reminds me of when my cousin used to smoke pot and he would throw the seeds out the window. Eventually the seeds grew into a plant and my grandma had some friends overand they were all intrigued by such a pretty plant. She said she did not know what it was called but gave them each a few leaves to take home.If only tea partiers knew how the current Tea Party movement got started. Why isn't every country a rainbow colored unicorn? There was also the part about each new member of the group requires a vote by everyone else. So if your group does not want you to have more than one share they can just vote against you getting another share. If they want more money coming in and like your ideas, then they may allow it. That would be up to each group. I see this all the time when mentioning getting rid of the income tax. "Hope your house isn't burning down, there will be no firemen to come help you." or the idea that you would have a huge pile of garbage because your tax paid garbage service would not show up.Outside of the fact that the income tax pays for the federal government and fire stations, garbage service, etc is paid through property taxes, I still get disturbed by this.Why do people believe that a fire station can only be run by tax dollars?I lived in a county once, the population was a few hundred thousand people, that had a private fire department.When I moved into my house I was mailed a letter with the private fire company's rates. I had the choice of paying $20 per month for full coverage, or there were fees for services. $50 minimum for a service call for small things such as a small kitchen fire or such and a maximum of $2,000 for a full house fire which it said that my homeowners insurance should be able to pay.I have also had private garbage service at most places I have lived. I now pay $10 per month for garbage pick up. They come out 2 times a week and do a good job. If they did not do a good job I would just call another company.My electricity is private. My water company is private. My sewage company is private. My current fire company is public. They used to be private but the county wanted to take over all fire services in the county so they snatched them up via eminent domain.My property taxes are very low. I pay about $1,500 per year on a house valued around $200k.  I just posted on this idea using Bitcoinshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46130.0 Not really. It is more like a vote by shareholders. You can have more shares than someone else if you pay in more than anyone else. Thus you have more say on how your money is spent. You have an equal say for the equal amount put. Which is how it should be. If tomorrow we said "Why not bring together the Bitcoin community and create a Bitcoin TV ad" and we had a few people willing to put in ten thousand BTC and others only able to contribute a few BTC, then those who contribute more would have more say in what the ad says and where it is aired. This would encourage people to put money in to the idea because they have more say. Those who only have a few BTC to contribute can still voice their opinions and even slow things down if things go completely contrary to when the original purpose was meant to be.But if we instead used a 51% majority of people vote on how things are done. Then those with 10,000 BTC may not be willing to contribute too much. They would put in the least amount possible to get to vote. Then their money could be spent on something they did not want it to be spent on because 51% decided to do it that way. And they would have no means to do anything about it. This is a way of providing compromise and time to compromise. Or they can come up with a better solution all together before the time is up.If it is an emergency then this would be the best solution because during emergencies people tend to come together and go with the most obvious solution.If you do not agree with how your money is being spent, this is far better than having a 51% majority going ahead and spending your money without your input. At least with this you can trade time for a better compromise that you may agree with.This encourages you to vote your conscience. If I do not agree and I am in the minority I can say no, and the proposed plan will not go forward for some time. Why would I want to vote yes if I do not agree with the solution? Just so it passes? But I do not want it to pass. That is the point.The system also allows you to leave. You can stop paying in at any time. There is no force there. To answer the OP:There is a thing called human nature. Humans SEEK REWARD and AVOID PAIN.If you agree with this simple premise, then you cannot support socialism.Humans will endure pain (work) in exchange for a sufficient amount of reward (money/goods). They will also avoid more pain (starvation/homelessness) in exchange for less pain (work).Socialism seeks to give an equal amount of reward for a varying amount of pain. Humans will do what they can to endure the least amount of pain, thus they will do the least amount of work if the reward is always the same.Thus socialism encourages people to do the least amount of work. If the least amount of work you can get away with is no work, then everyone will eventually gravitate toward doing no work.When nobody in a country is working. Nothing is being produced, no services are provided, and society basically implodes.The only way to counter the basic premise of socialism where everyone is given an equal amount of reward for varying pain is to use the threat of more pain to promote less pain.Thus governments must punish those who do not work, jail them or kill them in order to have any productivity.This is why Americans fear Socialism.One final solution is to brainwash people into thinking that they are enduring pain in exchange for the reward of "something bigger". Such as patriotism, a sense of honor, duty, unity, the good of the collective, beating the competition, etc... Did you bother to read anything up there?What part represents force? Actually, it has been found that new trees pull CO2 out of the air faster than older trees. Cutting down older trees and planting new ones actually helps in getting rid of CO2. The carbon is transferred to the wood and the oxygen is released. There are many wood based products that can be manufactured that could replace petroleum based products.He is right that burning it is of no use because all that does is takes the carbon in the tree and sucks the oxygen out of the air and just releases CO2 back into the air. Printing money to inflate the currency is just a form of tax, it is a tax on wealth.There is not much reason why you should not do one over the other. They both do the same thing just in different ways.We currently do both in the US.Getting rid of all taxes and just printing money would at least get rid of the huge amount of beurocracy that comes with paying taxes which would save hundreds of millions of dollars.But it would shift our way of using money dramatically. Any money that you earn, you would benefit from spending as soon as possible. There would be no incentive to save money. Investment would be very difficult.There would reach a point where people would drop the currency and use other means to trade. Then the cost of the IRS would be shifted to the cost of keeping people using our currency. The goal of this is to find the "most fair" way of voting for how money for a group/city/state/country is spent.In an ideal voting decision the outcome would be that 100% of the members vote the same way. But practically, that is hardly ever the case. If 80% vote one way then you are forcing 20% of the members to spend their money in a way that they do not wish for it to be spent. This could be considered theft. 51% to 49% is far from ideal but is often used, leaving 49% of people dissatisfied. Not the best solution. But even if you require 100% of people agree on something, there will always be that one or two person hold-out that just want to cause trouble or have an agenda which brings activity to a halt.Overall methodSo to the solution. I am taking the ideal solution of 100% voting the same way and adding an element not used in voting today...Time.The solution is for everyone to contribute their money equally and then have a vote for where that money is spent. If 100% of people agree, then the money is spent in that manner. If only 30% of people agree on where the money is to be spent then the vote passes...BUT...you add time for the 70% who do not agree. So, perhaps you add a day for every 1% who do not agree, so you have to wait 70 days for it to be spent. Then the vote goes forward on a different way to spend that money, maybe it gets 50% this time. The first vote of 30% is dropped and the second vote passes...but it will happen in 50 days. After some discussion there are compromises made and more people are satisfied with the way the money is to be spent, it now has support of 70% of people. The 50% vote is dropped and now it will only take a month before the money is spent. This may be satisfactory or if they want to do a bit more negotiating to get it done faster they can work with the last 30% to satisfy them. Either way, they have time to work it out. If during those 30 days an emergency presents itself, they may push forth another vote and this time get 99% behind it (1% just are not willing to budge). It waits a day and the money is spent.That is a very simplified summary of the concept, now how do Bitcoins come in.Bitcoins roleSay you have a group of 10 people forming a club. They all agree up front that they will pay 1 Bitcoin a week into the club and they all have 1 vote. A program is written up where if they do not pay their 1 Bitcoin they lose their vote until they can make up for the lost weeks. The function for doing this would be for each person to have a 10th of an encryption key when put together creates the full key which can then be used to transfer funds. They each pay their 1 BTC for 10 weeks and there is now 100 BTC in the one address. One guy convinces 2 other people to vote to give all 100 BTC to him. They submit the votes and set up a transfer to his BTC address. They have 3 parts of the key and the computer then begins working on un-encrypting the rest of the key. Turns out, this will take several years so it is a non-starter. Then a vote comes up where they want to donate 50 BTC to helping children with cancer. They all agree on it and submit their part of the key. 50 BTC is transferred to the kids with cancer BTC address. They are now left with 50 BTC.Then another person comes in and says he wants to join the club. The other members say ok, as long as he is willing to pay in the same share that they all have in at the moment, which is 5 BTC. They set up a new address with 11 parts to the key. They unanimously submit their keys and move over to the new address with 11 parts. They now have 55 BTC to spend. Another 5 weeks goes by and they now have 110 BTC. Some members want to set up a clubhouse with the 110 BTC. 6 members vote for it (the other members do not like the choice of the clubhouse location). They all submit their key and begin the transfer. The program begins to work on getting the other keys, turns out this will take several months. They do a bit more research and find a decent clubhouse. They vote again and 10 out of the 11 people are satisfied with it. The last guy is the chairman who really wanted all the money given to him and refuses to vote for it. Turns out it will only take a week to process through his vote so they go ahead with the transfer and start getting things set up. The chairman drops out and stops paying his dues. He loses his vote and it goes back down to 10 club members.Now say that another 10 weeks go by and they have 100 BTC. They find another club that has a lot going on but their club costs 10 BTC per month. Each person cannot afford it but they decide instead to join the club as a group. The other group has 10 weeks worth of BTC in their account so they allow the new share in for 100 BTC with 1 vote. The same process goes through, they vote in the same way. 10 weeks go by again and the new club now has 2000 BTC. They want to set up a lodge on a large property for their clubhouse. The same process goes through for votes, this time the original club has 9 people who agree with one hold out. The new club has 8 people in agreement with one hold out plus the original group who is not in support until that 1 vote is unencrypted. They decide to go ahead with it and transfer the money with the delayed time.2 years go by and the group now has 10,000 BTC in their coffers. They find a group that requires 100 BTC a week and is working on something big. They join them in the same way that the original group joined the new one and go through the process. The huge group has 100,000 BTC and decides to buy a large lot of land and split it up equally among all of the 10 shares. They find 3 different locations and various votes go through, each taking a long time. They get 8 votes for one final lot that costs 100,000 BTC but it takes another 10 weeks to get it to go through thanks to the hold outs. They buy the land and have 10,000 still in their coffers. With this they begin voting on clearing out the land, marking property lines, getting started on a community plan, etc. They essentially have the means to go forward on their own town set up with a system of collecting money to pay for things and voting on how that money is spent. And they can team up with other larger groups as wanted. People can drop out at any time and not pay, etc.tl;dr - Set up a system for spending Bitcoin as a group which requires each person to have a piece of a key. If 100% agreement is not there, the keys of the hold outs are unencrypted over time giving time to compromise based on how many people are in agreement.There are a few small things here and there that I have considered but did not want to make it any longer than it already is.  The Chinese people were allowed to start owning gold back when gold was about $400/ounce.Now gold is close to $2000/ounce.Bitcoin will be yet another commodity owned by the Chinese. There are several Bitcoin auction sites. It is factored in. 1/6th of Bitcoins are traded at the exchanges at a time.This is similar to taking a poll of 1000 people to find out how Americans may want to vote in an election. What those 1000 people say has a lot of impact on the implied vote of the other millions of Americans. Full disclosure though...your cat's blog kicks ass. It appears that early September somebody took out a lot of Yuen.
Not at all. I assume that only 1/6th of all coins mined are sold for a currency. Which is in line with the amount of Bitcoins held at the exchanges. I suppose I was unclear in my wording. By "trading currencies" I mean that they are being traded on the exchange for money.If someone mines Bitcoins and then trades it for something that is then traded in Bitcoins and kept within the currency, then it is not being traded on the exchange. At this point about 5/6th of Bitcoins are either being traded among each other or being held on to. This is actually pretty big (just read the article).Even a small bump in the Chinese market will affect us quite a bit. Link is screwed up...leads to a page full of gibberish. From what it looks like right now, only about one sixth of the Bitcoin economy is used for trading currencies. Ron Paul has sponsored a bill to allow competing currencies.H.R. 1098http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1098You could contact your representative and hope it passes some day down the road.Or just vote for Ron Paul in the Republican primaries. Like China has any sort of economy...or people...  Divided by 6.A bitmunchies purchased exchanged for dollars still has to go through the exchange which is what is factored in here.(7200 blocks per day * 4.7) / 6 = $5640Or just: 7200 / 6: 1200 Bitcoins per day. Ok, my numbers are not exact mainly because I am lazy and do not wish to waste my time finding the exact numbers.I have taken the calculations from this thread for this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45882.0I keep seeing how Bitcoin needs over a million USD per month to maintain the current price. Running the numbers based on the amount of Bitcoins created times the current price that would seem like simple math.In fact, it is not.Only those who are trading Bitcoin are affecting the price in relation to the various currencies. So everyone else is just using Bitcoin as a currency like it was meant to be.Doing a broad assumption I am throwing out the figure that there are 1 million Bitcoins in the trade exchanges. This is based on MtGox having 432k BTC back in June and it was estimated that they have around 600k BTC now. And I figured the other exchanges may add up to at most around 400k BTC.So that makes 1,000,000 BTC being traded at the exchanges. This is out of over 6,000,000 BTC in existence.This means that 1 million BTC that are traded affect the price of the other 5 million in terms of a currency. So, taking the figure from the other thread that $1 million needs to come into the economy each month and divide it by the portion that is actually being traded (1/6th) and you get $166k. Divide that by 30 and you get $5,500 per day.Only 1200 new Bitcoins need to be purchased daily to maintain the current price levels. This is why when we get a sudden influx of people buying BTC the price swings so much. Over the next year we only need 365 people to invest $5,500 each to maintain the current price. And then the rate gets cut in half and it will be down to $2750 per day. That is not much inflation for such a growing community.If someone wants to tweak my numbers with more accurate findings then I will update the OP. Your math has helped me to understand that we do not need $1 million per month to maintain the current price.As the traders are just a fraction of the total Bitcoin market so the price can be maintained at a fraction of that cost. So...if all of the miners switch to a new client...would that mean that I could mine on the existing client and get all of the booty for myself on a network that is used by everyone else? So at its peak the Bitcoin economy had $210,000,000 worth of coins.And you are saying that we have lost $210,000,000 since then.So the entire Bitcoin economy is now worth $0? Would be easier to just print up a bunch of Bitcoin cards with information on them.I usually pay about $90 for 5000 cards.This would be good for just about any event. I used to hand out Ron Paul cards with info at events. And you can get them easier.for now... Even if we convince a retailer to accept Bitcoins, it will be even harder to convince people with Bitcoins to actually spend them. I have not seen the big money person throwing the price up and down. That was usually when people would jump in or out with a lot of trades. If you have 3 apples worth $1 each you have $3 worth of apples.If you have 300 apples worth $.01 each you still have $3 worth of apples.You do not say that you have lost $297 since apples were worth $1. Going beyond your $10,000 idea...How to increase the price of Bitcoin.Get a conglomeration of several wealthy people with enough money to put into a pot which makes up several hundred thousand to a million dollars.Have a contract written up where each person follows the strategy.With the price currently at $4.97 I would have all people in the group buy to $5(which would not take much) and put up a true bid wall at $5.I would then let the Bitcoin community know that the price will never go below $5 unless someone is able to break the million dollar wall.Each member would drop and replace their bid periodically for verification that they are still in.As people start to hit the $5 wall, the person who is being sold the Bitcoins will be allowed to sell the Bitcoins at some price higher than $5 (say, $5.50).The price will fluctuate above $5 and the wall holders will be able to gain on higher values as the wall is attacked.Then, periodically, the wall will be moved up. 50 cents at random times.Each time doing the same thing. Holding the wall.The price of Bitcoin would become fairly stable and it may rise faster with the confidence that it will never crash and will constantly gain value. Bringing in more investors. The limits are there for your protection.So nobody can hack your password and steal more than the limit in one day. The hacker that got in back in June got away with $2,000 as opposed to much more. Had an idea for a shop similar to http://w00t.com that sells one thing a day. But I figured I would add the twist and have it for the same price in Bitcoins each day.Like 1 bitcoin or 2 bitcoins or 10 bitcoins. I settled on the idea of 2 bitcoins because the term "2 bits" is fairly known and catchy.I did find: 2bitshop.comSo my plan will be to sell a new item each day that only costs "2 bits", whether it is worth $10 today or as the price goes up, for $200+ down the road.When people want to know what a Bitcoin can buy or what it is worth...they will, on a daily basis, know what 2 Bitcoins is worth. And that will be at http://www.2bitshop.com.
I actually just went to google maps and drilled down to the area I am interested in and did a search for "rental" and "hotel". I found plenty and I could track them down to which was closest to the beach and distance to town etc.I am looking at the Puerto Viejo area. They say it is more laid back and a lot cheaper than the Pacific side. I have been wracking my brain on how a decentralized exchange would work in a similar way to Bitcoin.The high level concept is easy. Have an amount of cash in the system and an amount of Bitcoins in the system, people put in and take out at different rates which gets propagated through the system to keep track of whom has what.But the hardest part, I believe, is the part about putting money in and taking money out. Unless each user or each "miner" is going to be its own bank and allow physical cash deposits and withdraws, there needs to be a separate hook into regular banks.I was checking out this site: http://www.neteller.comThey offer a money transfer service via several deposit methods and several withdraw methods including sending you a prepaid debit card.The fees are what I am not so clear on. It says that a transfer of dollars is 1.9% which is not worth it since you can exchange your money to Bitcoin right now for less than .5%. But they did have a "merchant site" transfers for free. So, in theory, each "miner" could be a merchant site. They get the cash paid to them, then return Bitcoins to the buyer. Or the buyer pays Bitcoins and they send them cash. The miner could get a cut of the transaction (.1% or so).The way I saw the distributed program working would be:Someone wants to mine: They set up the program with a deposit of either Bitcoins or money. Once they set it up, the system takes the amount deposited and distributes it evenly based on total amount in the system. So that if Bitcoin is worth $5 and you put in 10 Bitcoin, it would even you out so that you have $25 in your cash account and 5 Bitcoin in your BTC account. As more money is brought into the system, the ratio would adjust to where the "price" would go up for Bitcoin. If more Bitcoin are brought in, the ratio would favor having dollars.The means of depositing and withdrawing could be expanded as the system evolves. But the underlying system of exchange could continue on. Bitcoin is more than just a currency.It is a Google trends predictor! I am heading down to Costa Rica for a vacation and have several vacation rental places lined up. But I figured I would just contactall of them and see if they are willing to accept Bitcoins as payment. I know that none of them probably do right now but at leastthey can check it out and possibly start accepting them. An international tourist destination would be a perfect place to accept Bitcoins. You avoid the exchange rates and can spend severalhundred dollars with just your phone or laptop. True, I should just go to the ICANN's competitor and buy there.Thanks for the advice. It means that just before Greece crashes and burns they will implement a few stores that use Bitcoins then blame it for the financial collapse.So "overlay currency" translates to "scapegoat".j/k Damn, there are hardly any Bitcoin domain names available.Every idea I come up with I do a check on bitcoin domain names that would go along with it and even after several different combinations there are no domains available.Some of them, I go to the page and 95% of those are just being held in reserve. So..you are exchanging currency for "Davinci Cash" which you can then only us at "select merchants" which then can convert to Bitcoins or back into cash...Why not just exchange your currency for Bitcoins which you can then only use at select merchants which then can either stay as Bitcoins or converted into cash? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx16a72j__8&feature=player_embedded +1Also, have a story about flying elves. That would make it pretty interesting. I offer 10% discount for using Bitcoin, partly to get people interested in it and partly because of the benefits of Bitcoin over credit cards.The shop has offered 5% off for cash since we opened. Accepting credit cards adds quite a bit to the overhead. The less they are used the better. In full, it took them 50 seconds with talking through the procedure and adding a tip.Compare this to a credit card transaction. Especially one that requires you give the server your card, they go back (having full access to make a copy) and run it, then come back with your receipt which you then add the tip and sign the receipt, then give it back to them so that they can go back and enter in the tip. Or heaven forbid it is one of those credit card machines that has to dial in. Correct. The machine is just the cash register that is in the shop.All that is needed for a merchant is a cell phone with Internet. Which is probably 80+% of businesses. The transaction is easier.You do not need to carry around your credit card (you do not even need your wallet if you have no need for ID).Everyone carries their cell phones with them, even on the beach.You could have POS sales anywhere that you have cell service (beach, farmer's market, craigslist transaction, etc.)No handing your personal information and credit card info to a complete stranger.Lower cost of goods due to lower transaction fees. Not my video, the hard working folks at bit-pay are doing wonders for Bitcoin. It is easier than the cash register.My wife has it set up in her store. She uses the cash register to get the price (actually she usually just uses a calculator because the cash register is too complicated for her), then puts the total into her phone app.And that is it. The buyer pays and she gets the Bitcoins (or gets paid in dollars if she wants). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ-pqo0cLcEI have used this, it is very very very easy to set up.If you have a store or know someone who does, send them to http://www.bit-pay.com to sign up for a merchant account.This is about to take off like a wildfire. Why it is very unlikely for someone to do a double spend at a POS purchase:http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/what-can-be-done-to-mitigate-the-risk-of-a-finney-attack/1189#1189The merchant would also get a notice if a double spend did occur, which would likely be before the person could get out of the parking lot. And it takes a lot of resources for a small purchase.Purchasing a car or something for several thousand dollars might require them staying an extra 10 minutes to verify the transaction. With the new Bit-Pay mobile device it is now very very easy to accept Bitcoins as a merchant.See a demo here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ-pqo0cLcEYou will start to see a lot of merchants with this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=44468.0A merchant can even be paid in cash so they do not even need to know anything about Bitcoins and can get paid in a way that they are used to. This system is very easy to use.It is implemented at my wife's boutique in Tarpon Springs, FL.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=44468.0Hopefully I can get enough merchants interested to the point that you can take a Bitcoin vacation in Tarpon Springs.
I could see some future services that use Bitcoin in the background but call the service something completely different. A date would be good though for collector's value sake. sweet People accepting Bitcoins would also be handy for the way my wife sometimes sells bikinis.She will take some of her bikinis with her when she goes to the beach. She usually gets a few people there who want to buy but they either do not have cash or they only have a credit card. Right now she takes her laptop with a credit card reader and a mobile wifi card to run their card.It would be so easy if both parties could just pull out their cell phones (which everyone has at the beach) and pay. Yes, I tried to implement that a few weeks ago but ran into some quirks with Wordpress that make it difficult to store session information. The page still needs some tweaking. Accepting Bitcoins in person has been a whole lot easier than doing it online ironically. You only need a Bitcoin app on your phone. Something like https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mtgoxlive.trader&hl=enThat bikini is available in the store. Just take it up to the counter and my wife will put the price into her merchant app which will convert the dollar total to current BTC price and provide an address and QR code.You scan the QR code with your app and click "send bitcoins".And that is it. My wife will get a confirmation within a few seconds and you are all set. Women's clothing and accessories, all different styles and sizes.We sell a variety of clothes for todays trendy women as well as several gift items for different occasions. We guarantee top of the line items at prices you can afford.10% off for purchases using Bitcoin! I think many are holding steady to see if the national chain restaurant thing is of any significance and whether the bit-pay POS system gains any traction.You do not want to be left sitting there with cash waiting for a lower drop when Bitcoin starts getting accepted all over the place with POS merchants. I think I have this figured out.Bruce has a friend who owns a Chinese restaurant that said she would be interested in accepting Bitcoin.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=printpage;topic=1788.0Most likely he has showed her the new bit-pay mobile app that makes it easy to accept Bitcoin for stores and she is probably setting it up this weekend.So...a national chain restaurant will be accepting Bitcoins. It would be like a Subway store owner putting the bit-pay app on his phone and accepting Bitcoins at his store and the story being "Subway restaurant now accepts Bitcoin!"     1. Open a free account at ExchangeBitcoins.com    2. Go to the deposit page, make a reservation, and print the instructions.    3. Make a cash deposit at any of thousands of bank locations nationwide.    4. Purchase some Bitcoins.A wallet stored on your phone is easy to carry. The value of the currency does not matter when it is used as a medium of exchange.Go to the store, buy a bag of chips for $2.50, it currently costs about .5 BTC. If you are worried about price fluctuations keep your money in dollars on MtGox. When you want to buy something in BTC, trade the amount you want. So now you have .5 BTC that you paid $2.50 for.The merchant plugs $2.50 into his bit-pay app and it pops up saying you owe .5 BTC with a QR code. You scan the code and click "pay". You send .5 BTC and you are done.The merchant then gets the $2.50 sent to him in dollars through bit-pay.Like I said in another thread. We need a BTC debit account which makes that first part easy. Keep cash in your account and it converts it to BTC when needed.Nothing will help money fluctuations other than wide use. Until then, other currencies will be more stable. I like the simplicity of the text and how it affects the merchant.Something similar for consumers would be perfect.Something like:Bitcoin is a safe to use currency that is great for paying for things online and in person.Paying with Bitcoin is easy with just a few clicks on your cell phone.No more worrying about carrying cash or credit cards, everything you need to shop is on your phone.How do I get Bitcoin?There are several companies that convert your current currency into Bitcoins.http://www.mtgox.comhttp://www.tradehill.comOr for an easy way to get Bitcoins:    1. Open a free account at ExchangeBitcoins.com    2. Go to the deposit page, make a reservation, and print the instructions.    3. Make a cash deposit at any of thousands of bank locations nationwide.    4. Purchase some Bitcoins. Paying in Bitcoin is easier than using a credit card. Scanning a QR code and clicking "Pay" is easier than paying with your credit card then having them print out a receipt for you to then sign, or a debit card where you swipe it and enter your PIN.And why wait? Like there are people out there with stores that need to hold off on implementing an easier payment method so that other people can work on the online aspect of Bitcoin? Do we only have 2 people working on Bitcoin that efforts cannot be spread out?Should I stop accepting Bitcoins in person and tell people that they can only pay on my website? Or do both? My wife's shop now accepts Bitcoins and I am working on putting up signs saying "Bitcoin accepted here" with the possibility of doing a 10% discount which would get people curious about how to get 10% off.The thing is, my wife is not tech savvy at all and does not understand Bitcoins. Is there a business card out there that can be given out with basic information on Bitcoins and an easy guide for people to understand how to get Bitcoins so that they can spend them at her shop? Currently the price comes up as dollars just like any other transaction. You put the price into the bit-pay app on your phone and it converts it to Bitcoin with a QR code for the consumer to scan. The consumer scans the code and pays the Bitcoin amount.The Bitcoin is then sent to the merchant's bit-pay account where it can either be sent to your BTC wallet or sent to your bank account in dollars. It is your choice as a merchant.You are charged .99% to get paid in Bitcoins and 2.99% to get it out as cash.I have a very low rate on my credit card transactions because I set up my laptop to swipe cards so the per swipe fee is under 2% for VISA/MASTERCARD. American Express fees are usually 3-5%. Plus you usually have a monthly fee of around $25 for the service plus a minimum of $25 in transaction fees.Then there is the equipment. A cheap system will run about $250. A receipt printer can run from $250 to $600.With bit-pay, I set up an app for my smart phone (which I already have, otherwise it cost me $150 plus a monthly cost of $50). A company that accepts Bitcoins to place adwords would be nice. You are too late. Easy POS payments are here and are being used.Too bad, because it is set up for mobile devices. And it does work.A couple of seconds is not a long wait. I can do a Bitcoin transaction at my wife's shop faster than running a credit card. And get confirmation by the time I put the clothes in the bag.The *reason* is that it is easier than cash. Everyone carries their phone. No running to the ATM, no counting out your cash, no worry about getting robbed (most smart phones have code security for accessing the phone)POS transactions are here, they are easy and simple for merchants to set up and use. No changing of prices, the price is calculated in Bitcoins simply through the bit-pay.com app. My wife's shop accepts them and I will be helping other stores in her strip get set up (a convenience/sandwich store and a tire shop) They can even get paid in cash and never need to know anything about Bitcoins. A monopoly cannot exist without government intervention. I have not heard of this. I will definitely look into it. Sounds like just what is needed to bring Bitcoin to the big time. Just take whatever stock you have and sell it on e-bay.If nobody on e-bay will buy it then you have something that nobody wants.
That is stated clearly on their website for all merchants:https://bit-pay.com/accountingHelp.html Have you called Obama to help you? All of this has been solved and is working with https://bit-pay.com/aboutMobile.htmlWhat I am talking about is on the accounting end. When there is one person who controls the business account and checks and accounting then it is an easy transition to a Bitcoin wallet. But with a corporation with accounting staff or off-site accounting services with many people in charge of small bits of purchasing and making deposits/withdrawals it makes things more complicated. Not that Bitcoin cannot be adapted to such an environment, but that we do not currently right now today have tools that deal with this type of environment. We just are not at that point yet. In my opinion. You should do like every other successful American company and buy Chinese goods and sell them at a mark-up.I have done a small amount of selling of chinese gadgets dipping my toes in the water through drop shipping. Drop shipping allows you to offer products at a marked up price without even buying the product or needing to store them.Here is one item I used to sell:http://www.chinavasion.com/product_info.php/pName/spy-pen-pinhole-video-camera-motion-detection-micro-sd/A Spy Pen with a video camera. The thing costs $28 wholesale, plus probably around $12 shipping from China. You charge $45 for it and get a $5 profit. The work you put into it is putting it on your page and then when the purchase comes through you fill out the form and address of where it is shipped.Here is someone selling this thing on ebay for $46:http://www.ebay.com/itm/Spy-Pen-Pinhole-Video-Camera-Motion-Detection-Micro-Sd-/180534553293?pt=Camcorders_Professional_Video_Cameras&hash=item2a08b2aacd#ht_5167wt_1396The downside to it is that the products are Chinese made which makes them fairly susceptible to being dead on arrival or of low quality. Plus the shipping can take up to a month, you need to let people know that the product will take 3-4 weeks to arrive. Also, you are in competition with many other people who have access to the same product (if they are more successful, buying a lot of product the wholesaler gives them a lower price and they can offer the product cheaper). The upside is you make money with little overhead and no upfront cost. I have searched for debit cards before because I wanted to be able to drop my credit and debit cards and have an easy way to budget out my spending for the month.What I found were a huge amount of fees. Fees such as $9.95 activation fee, $4.95 per month fee, a non-activity fee, 50 cents per purchase, one company requires a $99 activation fee.A good service to compete with this may be a debit account that can be used to pay for things in Bitcoins. There would still need to be a fee for converting your dollars to Bitcoins, but the debit company can get the fees down to around .25% per transaction with high volume on MtGox which would come out to a fee of 25 cents per $100 spent.So you could set up your debit account, keep your cash in there for spending. When you go to buy something in Bitcoins it converts cash at the current rate into Bitcoins and pays for the product.So where is the profit for the company? You have a bunch of cash from customers, you put that in an account and collect interest or do the fiat thing and make money the same way that banks make money on deposited money. You might even be able to lower the .25% per transaction cost for those who have higher balances or even just do a (no transaction fee for accounts with more than $500). So there would be no fee.Just a thought. I know that this actually is counter to what Bitcoin is all about because we want to encourage people to convert their currency to BTC and use it, but this would be providing a cheaper service than banks can offer and encourage Bitcoin merchants to be set up.  While I would hope that this would be true, I do not believe that Bitcoin is yet ready for POS acceptance outside of mom and pop shops with current services.A mom and pop place tends to have the owners running the shop or running all of the accounting and books. This means that they have full control over the Bitcoin wallet.A more corporate environment will have accountants that cut checks to pay for various things, with reports etc on spending. But an accountant with the Bitcoin wallet canjust as easily copy the wallet and take it home, then at any point just transfer all of the money out of it with no trace. Then claim that it was hacked, or that some otheremployee must have had access to it.Not to say that Bitcoin could not survive in such an environment. I just do not believe that at this time the tools are available for such an environment.We have gotten to the point where it is very feasible for all mom and pop shops to easily accept Bitcoins as a POS service through bit-pay. All they need is an iPhone or Android. That is big enough news and will move Bitcoin forward dramatically. So you are pissed because people were unwilling to pay more for a product on your site than they could get on another site?Did you have a disclaimer on your website telling people that it was a charity and that you are down on your luck and could use the traffic?As others have said, you need to buy things wholesale.Buy a pack of 1000 cards for 80 cents each, paying $800. Sell them each for $1 and you make $1000. Leaving you with $200 in profit.Of course, this involves risk because you may buy 1000 cards and nobody buys them. That is part of investing. To get a bigger profit you have to take a higher risk.My wife buys products for her store wholesale all the time. Some sell, some just sit there taking up space. She does not go out in the streets complaining to people walking by that they have failed her. The fact that they did not buy her leopard pattern glasses covers shows that they have failed her.Go find a wholesaler. Buy from them in bulk. Then sell with a markup. Seems like a good business model for someone.Bitcoin site accredidation.Just set it up so you can put "Verified by X company" on the page with a link to verification on their site.Several companies can be set up and if someone gets hacked and they are accredited by a certain company then that company would lose credibility. They have all of those covered on their website.https://bit-pay.com/legal.html Was thinking the same thing. I figured I would create one if it did not exist but made sure to go ahead and check first to see if there was one.I found this:http://www.bitcoinmap.com/ The thing about this is that you would need a wallet created at some point and then distributed unless the client is changed in such a way that the wallet is encrypted and distributed at the same time.I had a similar question of a voting mechanism where members of a club all contribute to the same address, then they vote on how the money is spent. At the end if the vote is unanimous they all submit their slice of the encryption and the money is available for distribution to the selected address/addresses.But the key is that once the wallet is created on any hardware, it is vulnerable to being taken by anyone with access to that hardware.Also, for poker. What if you had a sore loser. He loses and does not give up his portion of the key. Sure you could then get everyone else together and use that amount of information to try to decrypt the rest of the key but that would take a long time if it is a small group.I do see this as good potential for a democratic voting system though with something like a small village or club. The most ideal vote is a 100% vote, that way everyone agrees on where their money is being spent. But you cannot count on 100% because you might have that one guy who just wants to get his way and is willing to hold everyone else up to get what he wants. So the vote can then be a 100% - (X% * time). So if you have 1% not in agreement, it may take a day or two to get the money spent. If you have 10% not in agreement, it may take a week to a month...all the while having people try to deal with the 10% hold out. If 40% do not agree then it could take years, while most likely they would come up with a better solution where more people agree. Who knows, maybe Bitcoin could revolutionize democracy. It is. I have seen the video and just set up my merchant app and it could not be easier.My wife who runs the shop usually opts to use the calculator instead of messing with the cash register because it is too complicated for her will have an easy time with this.Just pull up the app, punch in the ticket number and price and she is all set. It shows a QR code that the customer can scan and they just scan and pay.Very easy. I think the only way to settle this and figure it out for yourself is to find a dead cat and bounce it on the ground. You will find the answer you are looking for at that point. They do not hold your earnings, you receive those into your wallet every day. So worst case scenario is they steal one transaction and the company packs up and moves to Singapore. All for your 5 BTC.I think the potential of 1-3% of all bit-pay transactions for years to come is decent motivation not to jump ship with your transaction of selling a bag of Cheetos. I am at 866 BTC right now. That is my initial investment, but at this point I will be setting up my wife's shop to accept Bitcoin and have the convenience store next door start accepting Bitcoin which I will probably spend buying Cuban sandwiches from him.I will start transferring spending money to BTC as I talk to more places locally and they start accepting BTC. I was able to get a sneak preview of this last week.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=44076.0I went all in at that point. Bitcoin now has point of sale capability that is easy. Plus, no more carrying around your credit card. Everyone carries their cell phone these days. This is it...quite cool from what I have seen of itEasy Point of Sale has come to Bitcoin.  Because any time someone steals Bitcoins or a scam is done using Bitcoins, it is big news.Yet when it is dollars the article focuses on the crime...not on the currency. Tried to mine bitcoins about a year ago...the client was buggy on my machine so I figured screw it.BTC was less than a dollar at the time... The Federal Reserve just gives their money to the government at cost!?!? How nice of them.If I was them I would charge interest....oh that's right...they do
I just heard it on the radio this morning. Did not see the date. US Congressman buying from McDonalds: The government gets the same benefit from McDonalds that they get from the Federal Reserve. They get a product that they can buy.Whether that is hamburgers for Congress or dollars for the US Mint. They are both products, paid for by the government to private entities. Over 127,000 Bitcoins have been stolen!When stolen they were in the form of dollars...This is a huge hit for the Federal Reserve Note as a currency...this should send the dollar spiraling downward until such loopholes can be fixed. The value of their gold would go up by the same percentage as the value of the gold that you have.The value of Bitcoin would also go up. I like it if it is what I think it is...how would one go about using this? I'm proud to be an American where I used to be free! God Bless the USA!!!collectivism is uglybe an individual The government gets the benefits that McDonalds generates too.  The only tie the US government has to the private Federal Reserve Bank is that it gets to choose the anointed head of the Federal Reserve whom is chosen from a list of the presidents of those private Federal Reserve Banks.It would be like saying that McDonalds is a government restaurant if the US president was allowed to choose the CEO from a list of 12 vice-presidents.  (and that CEO did not have any special privileges as a majority vote of those 12 VPs would be required to do anything). Here is the YouTube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J2_opPwfqc I have not seen instawallet. Sounds like a pretty decent solution. fast Not sure how to get to the link through the .gov site. I found it through DailyPaul:http://www.dailypaul.com/178272/ron-paul-subcommittee-to-explore-restoring-sound-money-tuesday-september-13-at-200-pm-et#comments Just heard Bitcoin mentioned as an alternative currency along with silver, gold etc..http://mfile.akamai.com/65722/live/reflector:36166.asx?bkup=36167&prop=n If I were to send my mom an e-mail right now saying "Hey, I have 5 Bitcoins for you. I need you to go to bitcoin.org and download the client, then send me the address it gives you, then I will send it to you." it would seem like more of a hassle than a gift.If instead you got an e-mail that said "You just received 5 Bitcoins from Michael with the following message: 'Happy Birthday'. To spend these Bitcoins click here to download the Bitcoin client and here to retrieve your coins (Save to XYZ folder).""Once you have done so, here is a list of recommended sites for you to spend your Bitcoins..."Easy coordination for the person sending, there is no back and forth between sender and receiver.I agree that the middle man thing sucks. But it would be more of money flowing through as opposed to large quantities of BTC sitting at some company's server. Here is a thought:How about a site where you can e-mail Bitcoins to someone.Basically, you enter the receiving e-mail address and how much you want to send. Then you include whatever text or maybe a flash birthday card or whichever.Then the site creates an address and you send the BTC to that address.The recipient gets an e-mail with instructions on how to download the wallet and how to set up Bitcoin.This would be more for a marketing type of setup where you can send mom or dad or whomever a few Bitcoins, whether it is for a special occasion or you just want to introduce them to Bitcoins.Yes, this would require that a third party site has access to the wallet. It would be for small quantities and just for introduction to newbies so instructions could also include how to set up their own secure wallet and how to transfer from the temporary wallet to their own wallet.If the recipient does not ever access their wallet...the money goes back to the sender (tell the recipient that they have X days to claim the Bitcoins).There is plenty of potential for profit from the e-mailing company whether through fees for sending or just advertising to people who have Bitcoins to spend as free money.And it would help to spread the word.Any thoughts? Is this possible? Been working on something for my wife's Boutique.Initial setup has stickers for her price tags:More to come soon... People are individuals with their own thoughts and ideals.End the collectivist groupthink. What happen?Someone set us up the bomb.Make your time. Placed my $10 trades on the 25th (unfortunately the high went up to 10.19 and I missed the fall on those)
I had a few sells set up at $10.2 that never got touched. I just checked my wallet and my credit card is missing. ChromeOptions->Under the Hood->Content Settings->Javascript (Do not allow any site to run JavaScript) More Bitcoins for me. Someone set us up the bomb. I saw one purchase of over 5,000 BTC fly up the screen...  I agree that this idea is not very wise.Here is another unwise idea that would be slightly better.Just have a few big money players put in ask walls at just below where it is now and periodically drop out and drop back in with an exact figure to demonstrate to the others that they are still holding.People will come to realize that the wall is not falling and will bid/ask above the wall. Then, as things pick up they can move the wall up a half dollar at a time. When the wall is hit and someone sells a lot then they just wait a bit until the price goes up a bit and sell what they bought earlier. With the knowledge that it will not go below that wall. Easy Point of Sale transaction.Merchant types price into a smartphone, customer easily scans the price and clicks "pay".With a confirmation sent to the merchant when it goes through.That would make Bitcoin easier to use than a credit card. And all you need is your phone. I sent it to you.You are welcome.  The last time we had the weekend effect, the next weekend it went up.After the 4th of July weekend when there was a 3 day weekend like labor day and the price went down, the next weekend went up.I look forward to pulling out before the Thanksgiving weekend. That will be a good money maker. (unless someone creates an easier way to deposit $ to the exchange before then) Bitcoin is about to become very easy to use as its intended purpose as a currency. I was in the same boat as others who see the amount of mining outpacing the amount of Bitcoin users but that will soon change.We will never see $6.12 again. The direct selling with the parties seems like a waste of having a bunch of people in your home only to sell them something and then they just go on to be users instead of advocates themselves.Bitcoin is good for a MLM because once you get involved with it you want to spread the word and get other people involved. And if you get paid to do so, then it is even better. With groups of friends or family, once you are all using BTC then you can start using it amongst yourselves. Giving BTC for birthdays, buying other products from them, going out to places that accept BTC together... So...the price of Bitcoins is a valueable predictor of Google trends for bitcoins...sweet! LOOK AT ME! I AM ON TV!!! I have noticed most around 2-3 PM EDT. True. Bringing it to someone who has never heard of Bitcoin kinda implies that they do not have Bitcoins at that point. Thus the person whom sells the package would also be their Bitcoin exchanger.As for it being a pyramid scheme, I have been involved in these twice. They get around the pyramid scheme laws by selling a product. The product could be anything, membership in some Bitcoin pay sites, discounts, a USB stick, a starter CD, whichever...As for the "who would pay someone $50 when they could just turn around and do it themselves?". I agree, that would be why you would need to offer something of value. I can imagine that if you go to Bitcoin companies with a large amount of people who want to spend money on their product, then they would be willing to cut a deal to all of your members.But definitely, everyone would be paid in Bitcoin within the membership and the only cash spent would be new users exchanging their money for Bitcoin. And if you are physically right there with the person you could take cash and give them BTC once you have showed them how to set up their wallet or if you are friends with them you could probably take a check and trust them enough to give them BTC. Not too long ago I stumbled upon a new concept that caught my attention due to the nature of the idea and the sophistication of its structure. Although I really wasnt able to grasp its definition, I was intrigued and eager to do some research about these bitcoins people were talking about. I discovered that Bitcoins are a new intangible electronic currency developed under a non-regulated money market structure and with limited supply that will give the term economic freedom a whole new meaning. All this sounded to me like something that could be either the beginning of an economic revolution or simply as an arbitrary currency scheme with the potential of creating another bursting bubble that could echo the dot.com era. The reality is that the bitcoin is much more complex than a simple currency; bitcoin is a whole new financial technology.Continued...http://www.strategicsourceror.com/2011/09/bitcoin-system-revolutionary-new.html Ok, I hate those stupid multi-level marketing schemes. They all suck and all of that but there is a reason they are around. And yes, I know that Bitcoin is seen as a pyramid scheme so this is probably a bad idea since it reinforces that idea. But...Bitcoin seems like it would be a natural thing to have a multi-level marketing setup for spreading the word.You basicall sell starter packages and help a few people get started in Bitcoin, you get paid a bit for your efforts much in the same way that a multi-level marketing scheme works. Then they go on and help people get started and on and on...I basically see this scenario. You gather 2-3 friends in your living room, you explain to them what Bitcoin is. You tell them that for just $150 they will have the same opportunity as you. You get $50, they get $50 worth of BTC and you pay $50 up your line. You show them how to set up their first wallet. You give them their first Bitcoins once the check clears and help them through the starting stage of getting and spending Bitcoins. Maybe have a business package that costs a bit more so that you can help them get started in collecting Bitcoins at their store.I realize that the multi level part is cheesy, but this would encourage you to get people into Bitcoin and it would encourage those people to go forth and get more people. You are also providing them with a service and teaching them how to teach others. And in the meantime, the BTC price goes up as well and more people start to use it.Either way, I think it needs to be easier for people to get started with BTC. It is like a gold coin dealer trying to explain currency to a farmer who has bartered their whole life.
Jimmy Carter also won the Nobel Peace prize...they are not all that selective. Hmm, I could have sworn that it hit $12 during one of those quick run ups before the conference.The Google trends chart does show some impact from the weekend of the conference (August 20,21). But ya, nothing materialized from it like everyone had anticipated (ie. CNN broadcast, etc.). http://www.dwolla.org/blog/welcome-to-the-family-veridian-credit-union/ The notable thing going on a couple of weeks ago was the Bitcoin Conference which took the price up to $12. MtGox still accepts Dwolla.So now, there is a $1 billion Credit Union with easy access to transfer money to BTC. Google trends shows bitcoins spiking up quite a bit. Bitcoin has to be widespread enough to stabilize.You cannot have a stable price when the value of all of the BTC is so low. Currently all BTC are worth about $50 million.  If someone with $50 million were to come into the market today the price would double.The same cannot be said about the Euro. That is why it is considered stable.There are currently 855 trillion Euro worth $1.2 quadrillion. Nobody will be coming in with $1.2 quadrillion and send the Euro through the roof.Each BTC would need to be worth $166,000 for the price to be as stable against the dollar as the Euro. The $8 wall is about 600 BTC, the $6.80 wall is about 3000 BTC.The fake walls tend to be on the dollar or the 50 cent mark.It would take the same amount to go up to $8 as it would to go down to $6.75 right now when the price is $7.10.I see it going up over $8 by midnight. The fundamentals are the basic premise of Bitcoin.The basic concept of having a distributed currency maintained by miners with an increasing difficulty as the BTC market expands.The concept is solid.Just because there may be companies or personalities that come and go that disrupt it does not mean that the fundamentals are not solid, just that some people and companies are not. I came in with my $10k investment at $14.25. I have been jumping in and out as I saw things coming and going.I have 866 BTC (was hoping for 1k before I held long but I see it going up quite a bit at this point). We have seen the bottom. $6.12 will be the starting point for a long road upward.The Krugman article should give it enough of a boost to stave off dropping further, plus I know of some technology coming out next week that is very exciting that should bring BTC up to the next level.I went all in with my $10k investment. I am in for the long haul. The price will certainly go up once it plays a role in such a niche market... Over the past few months a number of people have asked what I think of Bitcoin, an attempt to create a sort of private cybercurrency. Now Alexander Kowalski at Bloomberg News directs me to this Jim Surowiecki article on Bitcoin, which is very interesting.My first reaction to Bitcoin was to say, whats new? We have lots of ways of making payments electronically; in fact, a lot of the conventional monetary system is already virtual, relying on digital accounting rather than green pieces of paper. But it turns out that there is a difference: Bitcoin, rather than fixing the value of the virtual currency in terms of those green pieces of paper, fixes the total quantity of cybercurrency instead, and lets its dollar value float. In effect, Bitcoin has created its own private gold standard world, in which the money supply is fixed rather than subject to increase via the printing press.So hows it going? The dollar value of that cybercurrency has fluctuated sharply, but overall it has soared. So buying into Bitcoin has, at least so far, been a good investment.Continued...http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/golden-cyberfetters It will shoot up over $1000/BTC for about a day then free fall to hover around $800 with a slow decline to settle around $500/BTC. If everyone stops mining I will run a CPU miner at work and get all of the mined Bitcoins.But then...not everyone would have stopped mining since I would be mining.So basically, mining will never stop. It is exposure at least.If someone reading it today wants to invest they would probably take a few days to find out how to do that and then a few more days to get their money from MtGox to BTC.So perhaps a bump next week with real investors and perhaps a small bump before then based on speculation. Instead of charging a premium...you could always try to pay for the overhead with advertising.You can get a sponsor for putting a logo on X amount of coins. Just put a McDonalds logo on one side instead of the "B" or whichever logo.Who knows, maybe the cost would be covered by the ads.You can also put advertising on the pages that you sell the coins on with a "sponsored by Meze Grill" I have been saving a lot waiting for the horror stories and gloom and doom to buy.Another "Is this the end of Bitcoin" article would be good right now and I will drop the last bit of my investment. Buy on rumor. How do I get FREE bitcoins for asking questions?Maria.
Ya, I am having a hard time thinking of how it can be done as well. I was thinking at the very least you could have an auto-encrypted wallet where the password is made up of multiple characters shared by multiple people. The random chart I found on the Internet did not start at .000001I just wanted to feel included in the chart posting. This: How much time will you spend posting about something that has no use / purpose? Price is going up...looks like people are back after the long weekend. Ok, I know the real reason that the Bitcoin is dropping against the dollar.Because Obama is giving a jobs speech on Thursday and he will miraculously turn the economy around by creating billions of jobs with his speech and the dollar is on the verge of taking off.Drop your BTC! Buy dollars!!! I am glad I got caught in traffic this morning. I was going to buy at 6.6. I got in at 6.18.But I think there will be another dip this afternoon, then a correction up close to 8. Dwolla does not usually post funding to MtGox until the end of the day.And I am guessing that a lot of people were not taking the time to put money into their accounts on the Friday before labor day weekend. I have a high level concept I am trying to figure out.tl;drCreate a program where multiple people can put their money into a single wallet unaccessible by anyone with criteria for when and where it will disperse payments.tl part:DistributionI was thinking of several different scenarios. You can set the time of distribution, say once a week, month, year etc...or once it hits X amount, or you could have all of the people who donated vote on the distribution. You can set the vote to be 1-100% required to distribute with a threshold of sending the money back to the donors if there is no resolution by X day.Consider a mixed group of people wanting to support cancer research. They donate to this cancer wallet and it is set up to activate either at 1000 BTC, with a vote of 66% for the location of where the 1000 BTC will be sent. If there is no resolution within two months, the BTC is sent back equally to the donors.Or a neighborhood wants to build a park in an open lot so all of the neighbors put BTC into the park wallet. They come up with a few different ideas and companies and require a 51% acceptance for distribution. Once they get a vote of 51% then the money is sent. Otherwise it either has a date where the money is given back or it is kept there until there is agreement.Or a club that has dues where the members get to vote on where the money goes. The ProgramThis I am not too sure about. The hard part is having a wallet that is not accessible by anyone but the program. The person or server in control of the program could possibly be the weak link there. I do not want to rely on trust. There needs to be a lot of transparency and easy verification. I could use some suggestions on this. Thanks. I was wondering about this. Will we be able to buy and sell other currencies? I am down about ~35%.I got in in early July when it "came down" to $14.25.Had I stayed in I would be down almost 50% but I have been jumping in and out based on watching things.I have a target amount of BTC though and will do small trading until I reach that goal. It has gone up since I started so I am pleased.Looking long term I know it will go up quite a bit in the long term. Bitcoin at 50% inflation:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3105.0 Each node should not care whether the packet is coming from a wireless connection or a wire connection or even a connection through the Internet.I think if each node was paid based on packets transferred then people would be encouraged to come up with easy/fast transfer of data.I considered using Bitcoin to pay per packet but I think as the Bitcoin value increases and amount of packets passing through a network increases, you would have to come up with a way to raise and lower prices on your node and have the network automatically find the cheapest route. Maybe even having a setting on your browser to pay extra for increased speed if you want. Except that Bitcoin is at a 50% inflation right now.Gold is also a deflationary currency and yet its price is skyrocketing.But if people were mining gold faster than people were buying it, it too would be losing value. Do not expect major buying on a labor day holiday when all of the banks are closed and Dwolla is not sending money to people's accounts.Even if it was a regular Monday, the money does not go in until 5PM EDT.You have another day to wait for the week's trading to begin. I had an idea for a distributed wireless Internet where each user is also an ISP.You basically run your computer and allow relay of traffic over your wireless network. You get paid for the amount of packets that come through your network and you pay for using the network. This would encourage people to soup up their transceivers to get as much traffic to pass through their node. It would also give incentive to websites to provide content that would get a lot of traffic outside of advertising.This would eliminate ISPs, government interference with ISPs, censorship, etc. I bought 1,000,000 BTC throughout the day yesterday in anticipation of her buying 800,000 Bitcoins.Has Maria put in her purchase yet?I have some shopping I need to do this weekend so I might have to sell it all before the end of the day if she was lying. Bitcoin has gotten back on track of dropping about a dollar a week which was shortly interrupted by the hype of the convention which turned out to be nothing.The price will probably keep going down until there is enough interest to counter the 50% inflation. I believe that when the mining reward goes to 25 in 2012 and inflation is cut in half then we will be able to maintain and slowly rise in price from there on with fluctuations.But until then, it will continue to fall.So where is the floor? From the judgement of the users on this forum it should probably be in some Amish town in Indiana. It is pretty much Ron Paul winning in 2012 or the United States will go Bust.The question is, how will a United States filled with rioting and destruction affect Bitcoin?If Ron Paul is elected he may be able to slow the destruction if it is not too late.As for me, I have already started planning my escape. I have very little faith in my fellow Americans to make the right decision this time around.Their track record is horrible.
They probably want it in Prague because of the prevalent sex trade..http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1060878.htmlsorry...I just could not help myself.. Yes, because everyone loves being moderated.You belong in 1984. They need to just go ahead and plan the conference for Vegas...or Chicago! Stop Bitcoin? The 8.5 wall fell! I am shocked!!!  Has MtGox frozen? We are all pawns in the big money player's hands.Jump on and ride, the question is...when do you get off and when do you get on? I cashed out my life savings and am bound and determined to buy 10,000 BTC at $8.50 dadgummit! That thing is close to coming down, they almost had it and they keep coming back periodically.I was playing around in the 10.1 to 10.3 range for a while figuring that I was safe with that huge $10 wall holding, but they attacked it hard.I see it going down deep, at least over the weekend. It was around $8-$9 before people started holding onto Bitcoins in anticipation of the huge media blitz following the conference.Blitz did not happen. People are starting to cash out their coins. So after everything I finally noticed that my MtGox commission went up from .3% per trade to .65%.I just checked it again today and it says .43% per trade and if my volume goes up X BTC then it will be .4% per trade.Is this new? Bump for a useful tool.Thank you! It appears that the demand for Bitcoins is slightly outpaced by the inflation for the past few months at about a $1 decline per week outside of a few hype bumps.I see a slow steady decline that will decline slower and slower until it holds steady early into 2012.With innovation and more interest will bring about a steady increase of people investing in Bitcoin.Shortly before the reward for blocks goes from 50 to 25 things will shift and Bitcoin will steadily increase from there outside of a few dips thanks to scare tactics by governments and other currencies and jumps due to big news.So over the next year I see this:\__/ It is happening again.There will be a sale for .01 followed by a buy for .01 right after.I was not sure if it was some dumbass thinking that going back and forth would make him money (not thinking about the commissions). But the bots back and forth makes sense. Here we go...looks like down first. It appears that the bots or the big trader is setting up a swing on both ends. It will either rise quickly to over 12 then drop to under 10.5 or it will fall to just under 10.5 then fly up to over 12.Should be interesting to see which way it goes. It was fake. A week of people holding their BTC and their breath to see the reaction to the conference shows the market reaction.I see the price going back to pre-conference hold prices and rising and falling based on day to day news. How many other people received a port scan detection after posting in this thread?This is usually done by someone putting an image in a thread and then seeing the IP of those who view that image.And then you do a port scan on those IP addresses and bam...find a vulnerability.Followed by grabbing their Bitcoins. 9.76
People were expecting huge news from the conference so they held. The conference seems to be a bit of a dud as far as the CNN, Al Jazeera, etc hype.I see a slow push back down to $9 before the conference holding began. And back on track with the dollar a week decline from there on with slight upticks from media write ups here and there. The excitement of watching it jump back and forth from 11.25200 to 11.25209 over the past hour is mind boggling! New site up everybody:bitcoingoogle.comThis thing is going to be BIG! That wall will fall with the first hit. +1 You can change the price. Just turn off the options to the right of price.Also, I finally saw on MtGox that they are saying .65% per trade on the trade page. It will either go up and down the next time it goes up or down. I included ecstasy because the original use was as a marital aid touted by psychiatrists in the 70s as a miracle marriage saver. Not so much anymore. Cocaine, Ecstasy and Heroin used to be good things put to good use.Have they been corrupted? Someone just dropped a buttload into the 10.8 wall. It is going down... Just a high level idea but...Would it be possible to create a distributed system of wallets such that the wallet is created, simultaneously encrypted and then distributed on a system of servers similar to the way Bitcoin now works where an encrypted file is kept on various servers all over the world. And to connect to your wallet you merely need to connect to one of these servers, deposit some money and create a password and from then on that account is your own. Those that run the server could get a fixed interest amount for hosting your account in a similar fashion as the way miners are paid.Then during a transaction you could just connect to the account network and authorize the transaction.I have no idea but just figured I would throw that out there. Does your wife like clothes?http://www.heidijosboutique.com  This is the nice thing about what bit-pay.com is working on.Check out my site:http://www.heidijosboutique.comYou can make a purchase just like on any other e-commerce site. But when you get to the checkout page...you can choose between paying with PayPal or paying with Bitcoins.Same price either way.bit-pay is working on making this easier for all merchants...My next upgrade to the page will be choosing an icon on the front page to get all of the values in Bitcoins instead of dollars, or vice versa. With the current need to pump over $70,000 into Bitcoin per day it is difficult for it to sustain its current level.Those who put money in because of the conference are holding while there are still $70k plus worth of miner money pulling out every day.It will probably slowly decline up through the conference since it would take a week before anyone hearing good things from the conference and investing in Bitcoin would have to go through the week long steps to invest.So I see short term low followed by a rise in about two weeks. bit-pay.com provides a great solution Did you remember to hold some cash in Dwolla this weekend? LOL!!!You must have read these United States' Constitution and thought that it had anything to do with our government.Government is now of the corporations, by the corporations. And whichever corporations can spend the most on advertisements for presidential candidates which will sway the sheeple into voting for what they want wins.See Germany circa 1940s... Bitcoin transactions will be added to the taxcode at some point. And I will be laughing in the face of those sad people. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! I would like to call it balbadors after the great Balbador.
Definitely the closing price. *quietly waits for the next round* I agree, I split my BTC and $ evenly and will wait and see. Looked like two bots fighting each other.I was about to put in an ask at 9.5 and a bid at 9.8 and have them keep bouncing back and forth but they stopped their battle. Looks fine. You just do a $fee / 1000Which is screwy since you have the decimal specified before the input.So someone putting in: .60 and someone putting in .6 would end up with60 / 1000and6 / 1000Two very different numbers.I am not sure how to add a decimal before a number in php. Works perfectly if you just use a single digit.Or 6.5 Ahh, I see what is wrong.You have: Fee: 0.[65]%  which uses 65 as a multiple. If you have a fee of just 0.[6] it uses 6 as a multiple.So you have:100 * 10 = 1000 with a selloff of 1065 for .65and 100 * 10 = 1000 with a selloff of 1006 for .6 How hard would it be to set up a Bitcoin cash machine where you deposit cash like a vending machine and you scan in your BTC address and it gives you the BTC?It might not be something all that popular but if you had one in most major cities, people might be willing to travel to go get some if they find all other ways too time consuming.  Perfect! Thanks.One question though...where is everyone getting .65%?When I trade on MtGox it shows:Mt Gox charges a small fee (0.30%) for each trade.And with .3% would it not be multiplying times .003? Or .006 for two trades.So a transaction of buying 100 BTC at $10 would be $1000 with a break even point of $1006? speak of the devil...there he goes againglad I sold at 10.1...I will see you on the other side of 8 I am just glad that the manipulator is consistent in setting up the trades beforehand where you can see it coming.When it was $8 and he pumped it up to $12 I was ready. Unfortunately I got off at $10 instead of $12. The convention will have some impact but not this week. I somewhat agree with your sentiment that a lot of people will hold on for the weekend crash since most people missed it last weekend. But that does mean that a lot of people will be taking money out before the weekend in anticipation, thus perpetuating it. It will just climb back up a lot quicker at the first sign of a price decline.Bitcoin is still good in the long term. No matter what happens, half of the businesses pack up and go home, exchanges burn to the ground, etc...it will still survive and be of some use for somebody and is open to the free market and the ideas of people who have not yet heard of Bitcoin. Well done. It would help to add at the end "Price to sell back at to break even: "   eg. 10.12 I have lost about $2-3,000 over the past month. I got in at $14.25 with $10k on its way down.I pulled out and jumped back in lower a few times. I have pretty much kept my same level of BTC but my dollar value has gone down.I had gone all in on BTC at $11 last week before everything went in the toilet. Wish I had kept at least half out in cash like I had been doing.My goal is 1,000 BTC then hold for the long term. I suggest those billions of people do not sign this pledge then.Out of the other billions who spend $100 per month we might find 1,000 of them who would like to use Bitcoins. The first time through is usually around a week if going through the exchanges. I would be interested.Though I could see plenty of room for abuse.   "Everyone buy now!!!" As I sell all my BTC on the cheap... Defrauding with Bitcoins is just as easy as defrauding with car insurance or home insurance. You purposefully crash your car or burn down your home for the money. Then the insurance company comes in with investigators and find out that you defrauded them. Not only do they not have to pay out your claim but you also go to jail. They keep everything you paid in.Plus they can run the numbers against people based on the likelihood of fraud. Your transaction history and the amount you would insure would come into play. Insurance companies insured bank money for years. I wonder if there would be a way to offer Bitcoin insurance.You pay the insurance and if something bad happens to your Bitcoins and you lose them all...then the insurance company reimburses you. Then the company can go after whomever stole it.This could be a whole industry of Bitcoin detectives working for insurance companies.
You make less than $1200 per year? Do you live in Haiti? 900 people share your sentiments...  The sky is falling!!!Sell your mining machines! $12 down to $10!!!!Oh noooossss!!!! It is a chicken and egg thing. Not enough merchants support Bitcoins because not enough people spend them. If you had to spend 10 BTC every month, you might start to push local merchants that you frequent to start accepting Bitcoins. Merchants who know that there are 10,000 Bitcoins flowing every month will want to tap into that revenue especially as the price goes up. For those looking at the price of Bitcoins going up for this pledge...just think about what that would mean. It would mean that it is becoming a viable currency if the price is going up. Which would mean that you can use it in more places.If Bitcoin were to go up to $100/BTC I would not be spending $1000 per month on online goods in addition to my regular spending. I would be going to my local grocery store owner to encourage them to accept Bitcoins. If they do not accept them I would go to local farmers or food collectives. I would find an alternative to the big chains that do not accept Bitcoins. I would talk to local restaurant and bar owners that I frequent and explain Bitcoins to them, tell them that I have 10 BTC to spend per month and that it would benefit them to accept them. I would talk get the word out to mechanics about Bitcoin if my car needs serviced, and go to the one that accepts Bitcoins.The pledge puts you in the driver seat for Bitcoin. For all of us. That is the thing...why limit it to just random stuff online. If you are planning on spending 10 Bitcoins per month, you might put the effort in to get those services you spend money on every month to start accepting Bitcoins. Even poor college kids spend more than $100-$200 per month. If even just for food and beer.Bitcoins are about having a currency you can spend. If you cannot spend just a small bit per month then how do you expect to be able to use it as a currency in the future? 我將花費至少10 Bitcoins每月只有千，但其他人會做的一樣。- Elwar，Bitcoin先鋒（接觸）截止到報名方式：2011年12月1日6人報名，994更需要更多細節目前Bitcoins沒有使用多少為他們原本打算對，這是作為一個貨幣交換商品和服務。現在是改變這種狀況與早期Bitcoin開拓者願意一直花費至少10 Bitcoins每月上為所欲為。該基地的開支水平，每月10000 Bitcoins將確保商家有市場在那裡為他們的Bitcoin產品，並將進一步促進活動和增長的Bitcoin市場。http://www.pledgebank.com/bitcoin1000I apologize for the bad translation from Google Translate if I am way off. The 1,000 part is twofold. One is so that people sign up knowing that they are not in this alone. The other is because with more people using Bitcoins for purchases, the more prices will stabilize. If you just try to spend 10 Bitcoin on your own and find that the fluctuations are too much, then you might get discouraged and you will be more likely to not continue. But if enough people do it all at the same time, then prices will become more stable and it will grow as a currency from there.I encourage people to spend on goods with or without the pledge, but I think 1000 people could make an impact. There are 500 people logged into this forum right now. We should be able to get 1000 people to actually do what Bitcoin is intended to do.  See my sig for help with that.            VVV 6 pledges so far Or maybe we phase out POS purchases completely... True, even 100 people would have a big impact compared to the amount of Bitcoin spending going on right now.But I was figuring that I would be inundated by naysayers saying "10,000 Bitcoins is a drop in a bucket compared to 6 million Bitcoins in supply". 1 million Bitcoins being spent per month would be close to the currency of some small countries. But if we can hit 1000 people. Then we could have a significant impact on spurring the growth of Bitcoin. I agree. The 1000 people pledge gives incentive for other people to support it knowing that there will be other people supporting it and they will all have a magnified affect. Instead of just a few people "doing what they can". Imagine going out into the street with a big wad of cash saying "I sure do wish I could spend this on something"...Believe me, if you want to spend it, people will give you something to spend it on. Good question, there are plenty of websites that accept Bitcoin now.A quick check through https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade , I would probably start to buy solar panels at http://www.zumbador.com/ I figured I would let people come up with their own routines. I once set myself up with a $100 per paycheck allowance of PayPal money. It was the setting up part that took the most effort. People will stick with it or not based on their own motivations.If the price were to go up very high, then those who are in on the pledge would be in early and thus have some decent money to spend. Plus it might encourage people to get their 10 BTC for the month by selling things or offering a service.It is just a pledge. Nobody will go to jail if they waver from the exact wording of the pledge, just as long as they are supporting the original intent. Which will be helped by having 1000 people who consistently use it pushing the value based on their perception of what they are used to getting for their Bitcoins.Letting the market control the price as opposed to the exchanges. The pledge:"I will spend at least 10 Bitcoins per month but only if 1,000 other people will do the same."Sign up here:http://www.pledgebank.com/bitcoin1000Currently Bitcoins are not being used much for what they were originally intended for, which is as a currency to exchange goods and services.It is time to change that with early Bitcoin pioneers willing to consistently spend at least 10 Bitcoins every month on whatever they like. This base spending level of 10,000 Bitcoins per month will ensure merchants that there is a market out there for their Bitcoin products and will spur further activity and growth in the Bitcoin market.Sign the pledge and please let us know here that you have signed up.

Any input?Should I go forward with this or is it a horrible idea? Step 1. Deposit $10,000 to Bitcoin Debit exchange.Step 2. Exchange $10,000 into X Bitcoin.Step 3. Tell bank the $10,000 was invalid, request refund.Step 4. Take X Bitcoin wallet and spend however you want. How was the purchase made? Bitcoin Android? Buy high and sell low! Mix things up a bit. They will not expect it and you will make out like a bandit! I pulled out half last night at $11.7.At $6 I will buy back in. I have one of these:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackDogIt is a miniature Linux machine that is powered via USB with a fingerprint scanner which requires that you scan your finger in order to log in, plus knowing your login and password.It uses your computer's network connection, monitor, keyboard and mouse as periferals so even if you had a virus on your computer, it would have to sftp into your BlackDog to access any files.Would this be a safe way of getting and protecting your wallet.dat file? What happened mid-April? I sent off for mine as well. I do not know, I did not have a Mybitcoin address that I could check through the block chain. You know how your Bitcoin is a series of letters and numbers that make no sense?Namecoin is just like Bitcoin but instead of a random array of numbers and letters it is names. Mainly of famous actors. Hence the name...Namecoin. The MyBitcoin guy is selling all of everyone's bitcoins.And the polish exchange person who "lost" the wallet is also selling. I would agree that the MyBitcoin guy is selling it all...quickly. Cheaper goods for people to buy in BTC I suppose. I bought $1k at 13.7...it seemed low. Looks like now that the trade commissions are no longer at 0% we will be going back to huge swings in prices.Great time to make some money. Ok, I have an idea that I figured I would throw out here to see if it would pass muster.tl;dr  Create an Android app that scans barcodes at stores and allows you to buy instantly in bitcoins and have the products delivered.Basically I would have a simple website, for merchants and as a gateway for Android users. On the merchant side I would have a list of barcodes scanned by users and have a list of what items are popular along with data on how much money someone could make by selling them. Make it as easy as possible for a newb with a garage to see that he could make X amount of bitcoins selling X widget.On the consumer side you can go into a store, say you are doing your Christmas shopping, you see an item you like, you scan the barcode and either enter the store price for comparison or not. It would have the item name, a rating for the seller, a sliding bar for price based on how many days you are willing to wait to receive the item, and a "Buy" or "Don't Buy" option at the bottom. If you buy, the item is added to your bit-pay cart. You can then go throughout the store adding more items to your BTC cart until you have everything you need, then you just checkout and send in your payment. Walk out of the store with no bags and your shopping done.Ideally, on the merchant side, if this were to take off you would have small start-ups all over the country selling goods for bitcoins which would then turn into huge warehouses of goods to the point where Walmart will start losing market share to people just coming in to scan products for their bitcoin purchases.Ideally, on the consumer side, you would be able to get all of the items you want at a store at a lower price with the ability to pay in bitcoins. With the convenience of having it all delivered to you at your front door.Thoughts? Ideas?I could probably code up a basic prototype. I spent a few hours last night updating my website to include the bit pay option just above my PayPal payment option upon checkout.The code was fairly easy, my main time spent was duplicating all of the hooks in WordPress and the eShop plugin to duplicate what PayPal does, the final step of sending a POST to bitpay was the easy part.But it is close to ready for prime-time after just a bit of work. Though I will probably update the eShop plugin to allow for viewing prices in Bitcoin or Dollars.I see this as a fairly simple solution. When I first read about bitcoin I read that it is easy to accept bitcoin for your e-commerce site. Then I looked into how difficult it really is, you have to set up a bitcoin server to generate new addresses for each transaction to allow for tracking each transaction, set up the code to communicate between a secure server and your site, unless you completely trust your website host which is on someone else's machine, not to mention the whole thing of having a server out on the Internet with wallet files.This is just about as easy as putting a button with a form on your page. Sure you have to pay a fee. But it is worth it to save a lot of headache.And if my site starts making so much money that the fee is too much, then I can look into putting in the effort to build the solution myself and save the fee. And I am sure bit-pay will take that into consideration if high volume customers start dropping out. But for the average e-commerce site, this is a simple solution. Just signed up for it today.This looks like the bitcoin solution to PayPal.Now every website that sells stuff should be able to easily sell using bitcoin.I cannot wait to give it a try.I am surprised that they needed my company EIN though.
As of midnight tonight there will be no more 0% trades on MtGox.This will most likely result in larger spreads.I am not sure which way this will make things go but I have $5k in cash and ~$5k in BTC waiting for any big swings this might cause.Tomorrow should be interesting. I sold half at $14.25 when this happened. I am working on accepting bitcoins at my wife's boutique:http://www.heidijosboutique.comUnfortunately I set up the shop before taking Bitcoin into consideration so it will require some modification. I had looked into Bitcoin back when it was around $1/BTC and thought it was great, tried to mine but it kept giving me errors so I moved on.Then I read a few articles here and there, read the one about how Bitcoin had gone from pennies to a couple of dollars and how that was a 2000% increase. I tried mining again, it again gave me errors and I moved on.Then I read an article in June about how it had been worth $10 at the beginning of the month and skyrocketed to $35 before dropping to $20. At that point I knew that I should no longer wait on the sidelines. I sent out an e-mail to my family telling them that they should seriously check out Bitcoins, as the family geek to the family I was giving them helpful advice, hoping they might invest a little bit and see it go up to $100 or more.My brother wrote back asking if this was one of those Nigerian scams. I told him a bit about it and he just responded with some Guardian article about how some legislator wanted to ban Bitcoins and how once that was known the price dropped to $17/BTC. I just responded that of course governments will try to make it illegal, it is competition for them. I also mentioned that $17/BTC was up from $10 just a few weeks prior.My brother-in-law e-mailed me a link to a libertarian talk show that he listens to and said that they talk about Bitcoins once in a while.I explained to my wife that we needed to get in on Bitcoins now before it goes up any more. She did not understand it but I told her that it would most likely at least double by the end of the year. We have a $35k balloon loan coming up next year and we are racking our brains on how we will pay for it.I ended up taking $10k from my Roth IRA and buying Bitcoins. Alex Jones listener base is huge...I can see them all looking into it over the weekend, setting up a Dwolla account, it takes about 2 week days to activate, they begin their money transfers on Tuesday from their bank accounts, they get the money through Thursday or Friday and boom...price skyrocket by the end of the week. The guy probably lives on the other side of the globe. As of July 1 MtGox set their trade fee to 0% for 25 days. This has resulted in a lot of small trades with very few fluctuations with a slow steady decline in price as traders take their small profits and cash out.I believe that on July 26, when that is lifted you will see more people just holding their BTC instead of trading a few pennies here and there and the trades will be larger with larger swings.This could be the start of another uptrend as investors buy and hold for larger swings.This could result in another $35 spike like we saw in June. The market is about to skyrocket tomorrow.The mining difficulty is about to go up tomorrow, July 19th. Which means less bitcoins being created by miners and less supply which means a huge upturn.Plus, most people can not get their Dwolla money processed until around 6PM EST after the weekend so they are all sitting there wishing that Dwolla would get them their money already so they could buy in this downswing.I did the same thing last Monday waiting until just before close of business for Dwolla before my funds were available.Wish I had bought this Monday instead of last, right before the rise in difficulty. This.Even in some downturns gold goes down with the DOW. Not because of any market force, but sometimes people just need the money for stuff. So they take out of both. A true BitCoin chart will look like a complete circle.  I would think that the closest comparison would be PayPal. If everyone used Bitcoins instead of printable dollars, then wars would be less common.Wars are funded mainly from printed currency. BitCoin is a Ponzi scheme in the same way that Real Estate is a Ponzi scheme. Most likely they have a sell set to 13.50001 and a shitload set at 13.5When the 13.501 sells it triggers the 13.5 to sell. Some day I will sell my early days bitcoin for millions.  I have 500k going into my Dwolla account as we speak. 100 transactions of $5k each. It took me some time but it should be in shortly.Then I plan to buy until it reaches $25, then hold. The actual agreement is that you will not charge extra for the use of a credit card.BUT you can offer discounts for cash.My wife's boutique offers 5% off for cash. This is well within the merchant agreement and violates nothing.The same could be done for Bitcoins.I will certainly offer 5% off for Bitcoins once I get it implemented on her web page. Thank you for all of the responses. I was not trying to troll, just imagining the scalability. For most of a century people were paid in pennies.A penny for your thoughts, pinch a penny, the $5 per day job at Ford considered high wages...
I figured that this would happen when they announced the commissions on trades would be 0% for those who had an mtGox account before the hack.People are buying in small price swings and selling at small price swings. They can make a few dollars and pay no commission. So the swings have become smaller and smaller and smaller until now it has just been wavering by less than ten cents.I predict that the 26th, when commissions go back up to full price, the price will start to rise again as people hold longer and the traders set up larger swings for trading. How would you use bitcoins for a business if someone who has access to the company's wallet is able to just take it and drain it without anyone knowing?Say Walmart starts accepting bitcoins, they pay for new stores with bitcoins, pay vendors, pay for merchandise, etc.Their accountants are writing checks, keeping track of purchases etc. If one of the accountants decides to just write himself a check for a buttload, there is a paper trail and the person is prosecuted.If Walmart is using bitcoins, the accountant takes the bitcoin wallet, makes a copy, takes it to the nearest library and uses it to send to hundreds of new bitcoin addresses of his own, and he is rich.How is this prevented? My wife has a boutique, I have set up a web site for her (http://www.heidijosboutique.com) and have set it up to sell some of her items online.I am using Wordpress with the eshop plugin.How would I go about accepting bitcoins for clothing when the customer goes to checkout online? Just like everyone gets upset with oil speculators for the high price of gas.They would not be complaining if tomorrow a huge oil find was made with 10 billion gallons of oil available and the price dropped. But why would the price drop on such a find when it would take 10 years to get started on tapping that oil? Because speculators see how things will play out in the long run and they invest in those thoughts.Also, the BitCoin has not been very volatile. It has hovered around $14 for the past few days with only a slight deviation.From what I can tell, the fact that MtGox has users commission set to 0% means that there are a lot of people buying small amounts and selling those small amounts when there is a minor deviation making a couple of bucks here and there. This is why there has been no major swings. Everyone is fine with taking little bits of coin.When the 25 days is up, July 26, the trade cost will go up and people will hunker down with their bitcoins again and wait. That is when we will go back to business as usual and the price will slowly rise again as new people put their money in and do the same.But I am just speculating. Are you talking about Pfizer CEOs or their accountants? I agree that the drug companies should use bitcoins. Walgreens could always start accepting them.Oh, you mean the drug lords of illegal drugs?They do bad things to people? Like what? Are there laws against those bad things? Why do people not just call the police when they do those bad things?Oh yes, that is right. They are doing something illegal so they cannot call the police.Can you imagine the law suits against drug lords if drugs were legal?Do you see the gang warfare in Colorado and California between medical marijuana facilities? At least you said good-bye and did not just say you were going out to buy cigarettes to never be seen again!!!See? Is that so hard? Is it REALLY THAT HARD DAD!?!?!Oh...you were saying something about flaws and junk? Carry on. I have been following the electric car industry since the early 90s. There have always been people who would build an electric car in their garage or work with others to design the best electric car that they could figure out.The skeptics always point out the whole thing of not being able to go more than 20 miles on a charge or the amount of time it takes to recharge your car or for those who were saying it was good for the environment they would be shot down by people talking about how most of the US electricity comes from coal.All true in the early stages. And there are still the same downfalls but the potential is far beyond what it is today. The earliest cars were able to go 20 miles on a single charge. Newer cars are able to go 100 miles on a single charge. If the next generation of electric car takes the same jump you will have electric cars with a range of 500 miles, then over 2,000 miles...We are in the stage of the 20 mile guy in a garage type of work. I can see 2 to 3 years down the road the big boys needing to start to integrate the use of Bitcoins in a few of their products just to test the waters as the percentage of use grows. Back when I first heard of Bitcoin about a year ago I downloaded the client and got it running and started mining.I got an error message soon after and didn't spend any time trying to get it working. Missed out on a year's worth of mining. lolHow about if I sell for a loss when it hits $14 for the good of the BitCoin community? Yes...sorry Yes, another thread about the falling Bitcoin price.I know the ship has sailed because I have finally put money into Bitcoins and every investment that I finally get around to making is at the end of its hayday.Back in 2001 I finally bought some dotcom stock so that I could get in on the millions that everyone else had been making for the past few years...I had followed it closely from early on and finally bit the bullet and jumped in. That is when the dotcom bubble burst. I lost all of my investment.I did see the gold thing skyrocketing back in 2005 so I knew that it would go up. So I dropped $20,000 in when it was $400 per ounce. Then my company, SAIC announced that they were going to IPO in a year and that they were offering employees share purchases up to $20,000. So I waited while gold JUMPED to $425 and sold sold sold...and put all of that money into SAIC's IPO at $42 per share which eventually split and dropped and I eventually got my money out at $18 per share.Then came housing...I bought a house in 2007 at the height of the housing bubble. Fortunately I bought my house in Texas which was not as expensive as other places, needless to say, I lost money when I sold it 2 years later. I sold that house and bought a house in Florida...needless to say, the Florida market is not doing all that great right now.I found out about BitCoins about a year ago and tried to get the mining to work on my computer but after it rebooted once it started coming up with errors so I gave up on trying to mine, back when a Bitcoin was worth less than a dollar.I have always planned on getting some Bitcoins but just never got around to it...until this past week. I finally got money transferred through my Dwolla to MtGox and bought at $16.00 per BitCoin.Expect BitCoin to now crumble like all of my other investments.I have also been looking into land in Costa Rica... There are web sites out there that post freelance jobs and have people bid on those jobs.The donors could always either create a freelance job or donate to a job already created and then the freelancers can bid on those projects. The Federal Reserve prints money out of thin air to start wars, encourage terrorism and a drug war that perpetuates a black market drug trade.Have you dumped your Federal Reserve Notes yet? I told my family that they should look into Bitcoin, my brother responded with a Guardian article about how some politician wanted to make Bitcoins illegal and that the value went from $35 to $20 when people found out. Everyone is selling their Bitcoins to prop up the DOW!Put all of your money into FRNs!!! Umm...it says it will pay interest on your account but where does it talk about loaning out bitcoins in order to make money to pay that interest? Why should someone be forced to do anything they do not want to?It is his choice, fish or die. Leave him to his own choices. You can like to think that but it would not be true. It is one of the worst and should be abolished. This is the very reason that I believe bitcoins have no place to go but up.When bitcoins were much newer they had a few fledgling exchanges. It was mainly just some guy who set up a website and set up a very basic way of trading bitcoins. Hardly anybody used it but it was interesting.Then the more professional exchanges came out that made it easier to exchange bitcoins for money and vice versa. Starting out with bitcoins right now takes some thought and a degree of knowledge to get going.How long before professional companies come along and make it easy to get bitcoins. Once it is as easy to get bitcoins and use them as it is to set up a PayPal account, many more people will use them.The fact that there are 6 million or so bitcoins out there at close to $20 each means that there is a $120 million market of consumers out there ready to consume. There are literal millionaires who have bitcoins to spend.I am fine with jumping through a few hoops to get in before it becomes mainstream and the value jumps even more. My wife owns a women's clothing boutique. Once I get her website up and running to the point where people can purchase her clothing online I will set it up to accept bitcoins.I also have a side hobby business where I sell gadgets, I will set that up to accept bitcoins as well.
