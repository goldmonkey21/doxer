Thank you for the link, very helpful!Wouldn't be cool having cuda support on bitcoin  Hi all, my name is Alessandro and I am from Italy; I just read about bitcoin on slashdot and became isntantly amused..so I downloaded and installed it on my linux system, thanks for such a magic invention!My question is: does the number of khash/s affect the daily rate of coins generated?I have from my processor 1230-1500ish khash/s, running stock frequency (2400mhz), but I can easily get it running 3000-3200 mhzCan I calculate the approximate number of coins generate per day, given the statistic khash/s value? How many coins am I getting per day with 1230 khash/s ?IS there any formula ?Thanks in advance. Alex
