Sorry about the delay, I've be waiting until I've found and resolved the issue so I can do a one time correction. Unfortunately it happened again last night so now I've put in code to attempt to detect the issue when it happens and autocorrect. This means going forward the bug, while still existant, won't have an effect. Now that that's done I'll revisit the uncorrected blocks and do a fixup. What I'll probably end up doing is a btc payment to all the affected accounts based on the affect the extra blocks had. Those short blocks aren't found. It's a bug in the pool software I'm using that occasionally reports a double finding of a block. I'm trying to track it down. If you read the thread on the HHTT pool they're having the same issue (I use the same software as them in the backend for Stratum users). Here's the discussion on my pool about the same same short block/orphan issue. Without actual commerce in ixcoin there won't be much in the way of fees so it's unlikely that the current large miners will continue mining.  Enthusiasts will likely still mine so the coin will probably continue. One of the reasons for ixcoin, if I recall correctly, was to see what would happen when a coin stops having a subsidy to get an idea of what will happen with bitcoin. I have had the same on my pool which uses the same stratum software as HHTT. I wonder if there's an issue somewhere. I'd get a 'block' with 20 seconds of another which is never submitted to the network. BTC increases when a block is found. Note the 'Round Duration' on your page. It's over 24 hours. That's why you haven't had an increase - no blocks have been found in that 24 hours. Back up now. Yeah, just went down due to a bitcoind crash. Bringing it up now. Withdrawals should be working. Email admin@bitparking.com with account details if you have issues. I've not finished it yet but I will complete it soon. Be careful about the blockchain you get. A while back I had numerous issues getting the right chain and my client refusing to reorg to the correct one. i0coin is tradeable on Vircurex now. I've removed the two erroneous blocks from the system and put a note on the front page of the pool about it. I'll adjust the DGM payment amounts this weekend and comment here when done. I've put some logging and changes in place to track down where the double submission might be occurring.  You won't be penalized for it - when I've tracked it down I'll reverse the effects. Technically it's not "known good" until 120 confirmations because that's when the pool gets paid. I haven't looked at that specific case, I'm commenting on the 'should have gotten X shares in a block' remark. I'll take a look at the block in question and see if there's anything unusual about it. The duration times shown on the website are actually the times the website got notification of the solved block, not the time the actual block was solved. It can be off by up to 60 seconds depending due to caching in the services that notify the database of shares and blocks found. That block duration was probably more like 10 seconds. I'm not at all upset or shocked that people would be upset. By the same token I would hope others aren't shocked and upset to know that I'm being careful with the situation involving large numbers of namecoins so as not to make further mistakes. I'm not at all prepared for the task of dealing with so many angry emails - this was just a hobby project I set up when coins were pretty much worthless - and I admit I'm not great at responding to them. I'd rather just do the job of fixing things. I have had updates of progress here and here. I respond to polite emails about progress when I can. A large number of people have had their funds restored. A large number haven't - in particular ones involving trades around the day of the crash. Corruption in the trade data, corruption in the wallets, has made things difficult. My current step has been to work out what namecoin funds cannot be recovered, and then work try to work out a payment of existing funds followed by some form of ongoing payment for the remaining amounts I wasn't able to recover. At that point I'll put an update on the website with details so users can know where there stand.  The exchange had backups but unfortunately I was caught out by the flurry of activity with the pumping of prices that occurred over the few days around the crash. There were a significant number of transactions during the day of the crash that occurred after the last backup. Hundreds of thousands of namecoins were traded. The disk data was corrupted and I've not been able to recover everything. Recovering the state of transactions and funds has been, and continues to be, a significant amount of work. I'm trying. Yes, I'm not fast as people would like but I'm doing the best as I can. It was obviously a mistake keeping the namecoin exchange going once the price of bitcoins and namecoins went beyond hobby status. That said I'm still processing data. I've slowed sending refunds out while I process the state of the unrecoverable data and will pay out what exists and then some form of ongoing payment system for the unrecoverable funds. I can temporarily disable i0coin and groupcoin generation which I added around August 6 and see if that makes a difference. If you can confirm that you're still mining and can check if disconnections still occur I'll make the change and see if it affects it.
Deposits of alt coins to vircurex seem to be not working. If you are mining alt coins with a vircurex address you might want to avoid withdrawing until the situation is resolved. It's not hours that defines whether a round is longer than usual, it's the number of shares compared to difficulty. At the moment we're about 2.5x difficulty which is nothing extreme. There have been 10x difficulty rounds before! The only cure for long round times in terms of hours is higher hash rate.It depends how many shares are found by others during the time you're offline. You'll still discharge over time in other blocks that matches up with your charge rate. Discharging takes quite a few blocks IIRC. Where are you based (What country)? "-D -P" works for me on cgminer v3.3.1 on 64bit Linux. Maybe it's a Windows thing. I'll continue to look into the disconnect issue but it's difficult without being able to reproduce. If you can solve the -D/-P problem and get logs it will be helpful otherwise there's not much I can do. I'm not getting them. Is anyone else getting disconnects? It started at 48 IIRC. It's halved a few times since then. I use 3.3.0 with no problem. I'll try the latest version 3.3.3. Can you provide me with logs? Preferably protocol dumps (-P I think) around the time a disconnect occurs. There are only 6 i0coins generated on each block so the number of i0coins produced is low. Divide that by the large number of people in the pool with an i0coin address and this is why you're not seeing a lot. There's other big miners mining the chain as well. This pool only gets about 30% of the blocks - the other 70% must be solo miners and/or another big pool. Are you using bfgminer? If so, what version? Do you get the same disconnects on cgminer? I'm running USB ASIC on cgminer with no disconnects. I'd need a week to schedule testing and upgrade but whatever you think is best beyond that. I'll go along with whatever the current coin developer and users prefer. It'll be helpful if there is plenty of time from the release of the code to when it activates. I'm only about 30% of the network though so it'll take time for the new version to get a majority on the network. No, they sold more i0coins than they had. Exploit looks like this (it's a 51% attack):1. Start mining on a forked chained, not publishing your blocks.2. Transfer 100,000 i0coins to exchange. Don't include this transaction in your fork in (1).3. Once i0coins have all confirmed, sell them and withdraw the bitcoins.4. When your fork in (1) is past the main chain, publish it. As it includes all transactions except (2) this rolls back your transaction and you get your i0coins back. You now have the bitcoins and the i0coins.5. Repeat from (1) as many times as you can before the exchange notices.This is why low hash rate chains are so dangerous for exchanges. It would have been http://ixchange.bitparking.com which was closed, along with the i0coin exchange I ran, when the i0coin exchange got double spent for 200 bitcoins. Yes, unfortunately luck has not been great the last few rounds.  It should work fine on the stratum server. If you have any issues feel free to post here and someone will try and help. Bitparking has currently around 50 immature blocks out of 120. It floats from 30-55 over the last few days. That means it has less than 50% of the hash rate. Bitparkings entire hashrate isn't used on i0coin as I don't react to blocks found meaning I get a lot of stale share submissions. There's at least one other big miner mining the chain. For ixcoin and devcoin there are other big miners mining it too - When I last investigated it was disqus fish and/or 'made in china' IIRC. It's a pretty old coin with a 1.5 minute or so block time. It's a good example of what bitcoin will be like when it gets this many blocks. Yes, the pool keeps the coins. Enough miners are claiming the existing coins so that they waver around break even. The new coins I expect the pool will be able to build up a buffer before people add to  their addresses so it provides a base for handling PPS swings.
The bitparking pool has now enabled i0coin (and groupcoin) for testing. Let me know if you have any issues. It's currently applying only a percentage of the pool towards i0coin to prevent pool performance issues due to large numbers of block submissions. Bitparking is testing merge mining groupcoins. You can register an address an earn coins. This is an experiment to see if the coin is desired.  This was caused by the enabling of i0coin for testing. It was finding i0coin blocks so fast that it impacted pool performance. I've tuned it now so only a portion of the hash rate goes to i0coin.This of course means that i0coin is now available. If you've already got an i0coin address registered then you're already mining them. If not, you can register a new account and add an address.I've also added groupcoin, another merge mineable coin. Both these coins are in 'testing'. If they cause issues with the pool then I'll remove them after the testing period. Neither coin has an exchange for them yet but if they do get one, you'll have coins. Yes, I'm currently testing it at the moment. Yes, I'll likely add it it. I'll start with putting some hash rate towards it and see if it's stable before opening it up for registration. Bitcoin 0.8.2+ has been fairly unstable for me when used on the pool. What did you do about about the block forking features added in bitcoin that weren't in i0coin originally? I assume this client can cause block forks due to p2sh support, level db vs bdb differences, etc. This would make it a requirement for your client to be used by everyone pretty quickly. Probably not a big deal since i0coin isn't getting much mining power or exchange presence. bitparking does merge mining of namecoin, ixcoin, devcoin as well as bitcoin with stratum. The pool has no fee (it's currently funded out of transaction fees). Additional income from the merged coins is currently:Code:< mmbot> NMC is 0.00595 BTC per NMC at btc-e, we earn 126.181203093 NMC per bitcoin block = 0.750778158403 BTC or 3.0% additional BTC per block< mmbot> IXC is 3.652e-05 BTC per IXC at Vircurex, we earn 1622.7536957 IXC per bitcoin block = 0.059262964967 BTC or 0.24% additional BTC per block< mmbot> DVC is 6e-07 BTC per DVC at Vircurex, we earn 84518.4216511 DVC per bitcoin block = 0.0507110529907 BTC or 0.2% additional BTC per block< mmbot> Total extra BTC per block is 0.860752176361 or 3.44% extra incomeNot huge but not bad either. i0coin had merge mining added first. Then ixcoin added it once it was proved to work for i0coin. I was travelling overseas and was without internet for longer than expected to release the payments, sorry. Now that I'm back I'll work on automating that process as a priority. It enables you to use the merge mine proxy program to merge mine bytecoin as the primary chain. The patches aren't needed if you're using pool software (eg. p2pool, eloipool) that do what those patches do using getblocktemplate. The advantage of using the mergemineproxy is you don't need pool software so it's easy to solomine. They've implemented what is done via the patches to bitcoin internally into p2pool. The mergemineproxy could be modified to do this as well but no one has. It predates 'getblocktemplate' which was the functionality added to bitcoin that allowed this type of thing to be done outside of patching bitcoin. The 'now supports merge mining' was referring to being able to use it with software that uses the merge mining proxy protocol (getworkaux rpc, etc). That isn't included in bytecoin before their latest round of changes. No, it can't without additional block forking changes. ixcoin is about 80,000 blocks away from having its subsidy drop to zero. This means miner income from that coin will only be via transactions. Will the coin survive this? Will the price increase or collapse when this happens? I think this was one of the experiments of the coin - to make that drop to zero happen faster than bitcoin to see what effect it has. Block 227,499 is the cutoff block number. Ah, I see! The seed is the previous block hash and is passed to the random number generator.Edit: It seems to use a substring of the prevhash. If difficulty reaches a certain value (bitcoin levels?) won't it always produce the same substring and therefore the same random value? How does this work in terms of nodes validating blocks? In other coins they check the number of generated coins is valid and fail to validate if a number greater than the subsidy value is there. In this coin if the random check succeeds the subsidy value will be higher. Any other node validating the block would also need to hit that random value successfully to actually validate it without rejecting the block as invalid. And every node on the network would need to do that everytime it validates the blockchain.How does this coin prevent that from happening? If it doesn't validate the block amount then people could change the source to any subsidy they want.Edit: See the check in ConnectBlock that the generated coins is not greater than GetBlockValue. The value of that will change for each node that tries the random number. No sane person would run a closed source alt coin client. How would they know it wasn't a wallet stealer? You haven't explained how they are stealing it. Are they implementing features you didn't ask for? Are they not doing things you're asking for? You might want to try to develop a thicker skin if you want to develop an alt coin. The alt coin world is full of people trying to exploit them, hack them, find out flaws in their reward schemes, etc, etc. I definitely don't recommend paying anyone to do it since the risk of failure is huge. It doesn't mean they hijacked the coin, it just means they could. If they're implementing what you want, and doing what you want, then there's no hijack. What exactly are they doing that you're not happy with? I'm not entirely sure what you've done since this is the ixcoin thread and you seem to be talking about some other coin without any links to what that coin is. It sounds like you got someone to create a coin for you and they've got control of it due to the source repository being controlled by them? If so, not much you can do. I hope you didn't pay them any money. If you want to 'found' a coin you really need to control the canonical repository, website and announcement thread/forum for it yourself. If you hire a programer to work on it don't give them access to the core repository. Take pull requests or patches for the changes they're making, sanity check them, then apply them yourself.
I'm under the impression that my pool, bitparking, and fireduck's pool, HHTT, support it unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by reconnect support. Sure, but as I've said more than once already...If you're using the merge mine proxy you need these patches. But the reason I provided the commit is not for the millions of people using the merge mine proxy, it's because it ports a bunch of stuff that the secondary chain code uses and I had thought those interested in that would like using it as a base, or looking at it to see what changes are needed, to porting the other patches. Assuming you meant 'primary' not 'secondary', you do if you want to use the 'merge mine proxy'. You don't if you use pool software that does internally what merge mine proxy does (eg. eloipool). From your coin repository, something like:1. git remote add foo git://github.com/doublec/bitcoin2. git fetch foo3. git cherry-pick 7a6e135db4cdbf70c56546da8a5974152ef84e5a4. Fix any conflictsIf you're stuck I could probably do it for a 50 BTC  bounty or so. If you cherry pick the commit I referenced to your coin and use the "merge mining proxy" that is included in the 'contrib' directory that is added by that commit then you can have your coin as a primary chain while mining DVC, etc as secondary chains. You won't be able to mine bitcoin though but from your posts I'm assuming you are fine with that. No, I mean as a primary chain using the merge mining proxy software. That software requires extra RPC commands to be patched to bitcoin. This patch ports those extra RPC commands. But those RPC commands also use a bunch of stuff that the secondary chain RPC commands use - so a lot of the porting work to get the secondary chain additional stuff working is also done in this patch. Well, yes and no. If they're using the 'merge mining proxy' they can't as that proxy requires patches to bitcoin. If they're using custom block generation pool software then that software would need to be changed to work with their coin. That's why I wrote "Although it doesn't include the patches required for an auxilliary chain it should be fairly easy to add those as it'll just be the rpc functions that are needed.". That commit does all the hard work. It ports over the auxpow stuff, changes the things required in block creation,etc. You can do the rest if you want it. I have a version of the patches required to use bitcoin as a primary chain rebased on top of bitcoin 0.8.1 with the recent security fix and performance improvement patch from 0.8.3 and 0.8.2 respectively cherry picked. It's in the m0.8.1_merged branch of my bitcoin fork on github: https://github.com/doublec/bitcoin/tree/m0.8.1_mergedThe commit you're looking for for just the merge mining code is: https://github.com/doublec/bitcoin/commit/7a6e135db4cdbf70c56546da8a5974152ef84e5aThe branch also includes a patch for using libzmq for block notifications which you probably don't want. Although it doesn't include the patches required for an auxilliary chain it should be fairly easy to add those as it'll just be the rpc functions that are needed. The patch also includes some extra stuff I used to use for implementing getblocktemplate with merge mining but you can strip those out if you don't need them. What does "redoubling the bounties" mean? Do you mean multiplying them by 2? What pools do and what pools don't support it? It had 0.5 BTC of transaction fees too which has been the highest the pool has come across for some time. Bad block to orphan! Some pools have Tor endpoints. For example, HHTT. Yeah, looks like they are preferring to build on their own blocks when they can. Look at the coinbase for the generate transaction. It will have some conspicuous extra data if they're merge mining.  The ixcoin author's name is an exact anagram for Satoshi Nakamoto so it's unlikely to be a real name. Yes, good idea. I'd change it to not be case sensitive but old accounts rely on it now. Ah, found the previous one by looking up your registered addresses for that. It was "SHTTD". If you know one of the addresses you registered I can look it up. I have not heard of anyone reporting this. Is your miner falling back to a backup pool?
There's definitely no user 'shttd' which is why no coin balances are showing. You're must have registered with a different name. The pool accepts but silently discards shares from users that aren't registered. The page for stats sees that the shares were submitted and shows a hash rate which is why that's there. You're probably looking at the wrong userid. If you enter a non-existant user it shows a page with no coin balances. Make sure you are using the correct capitalization. Email admin@bitparking.com with your username if you are stuck. If you've had contact from me you are in the queue. Lots of people have had their accounts processed and have posted about it. Most haven't posted about receiving it. There's also lots of people left to process as I outline here. It's an unfortunate situation but I'm doing my best. It's a Pitcairn Island Domain (.pn) so exists in the normal domain name system. I wanted a two letter domain and I boringly chose 'cd' for my initials. Some of my family ancestry involves Pitcairn Island and I visited there last year which is why I chose that top level domain. The domain name I use for various projects. The machine hosting my bitcoin stuff was originally bit.cd.pn and now it also hosts bitparking. Minimum withdrawal amounts have changed. They are now:* BTC: 0.01, down from 0.05* NMC: 0.05, remains the same* DVC: 10, down from 50* IXC: 0.01, down from 0.05 Right, but it pays less on short blocks allowing the pool to build up a buffer. So during unlucky times it pays more and during lucky times it pays less. There's CoiledCoin but no one trades it on the exchanges  If it's a sha256 coin that's tradeable and mergeable I'd look at adding it, yes. Yes, it should be possible. No problem, done. Sure, I've added it to the front page and the blockstats page. it is the longest in time I think but it's not the longest block in terms of percentage of difficulty. it's currently at 24% luck but previously we've been as low as 12%. Hopefully it won't get that bad. Luck here is defined as difficulty divided by the number of shares. A bad run does indeed suck though!  It's about 2.6% at the moment using BTC-E's rate. 3.2% if you include the other tradeable merge mineable coins. I've added the CORS access control header to the user and blockstats page. Let me know if that helps. Bitparking is now "no fee" on DGM. This is to compensate for the extended time it's taking to implement paying out transaction fees to miners. Since the task of implementing transaction fee payout to miners is taking longer than expected I've made an adjustment to pool fees. From this moment the fee for DGM reduces from 1.5% to 0%. That is, there is no explicit fee on DGM mining for bitcoins. The pool continues to keep transaction fees. Once I've made the code changes to allow distribution of transaction fees I'll switch back to 1.5%. So for now, enjoy no fee DGM. 50.116.37.18 is a long running node I run. Not yet unfortunately. The pool isn't my full time job so adding and testing features that involve risky things like payouts take a bit of time. The last lot of changes I did, regarding orphans, put in a bunch of stuff allowing transaction payments but I still need to do the rest. No, I'm not eating my words. Transactions fees are currently being used to build pool reserves. I'm also implementing support for paying transactions fees. That support is not yet done. In the meantime I'm letting you know what they're being used for, hence 'currently'.
It is not possible to create hundreds of thousands of coins out of thin air in a 51% attack. They can mine from a point further back from the main chain and when they surpass the main chain a reorganization occurs which would result in their chain being the main one. The coins they legitimately mined are then real and those that are on the losing chain lose theirs. It's not really 'out of thin air' though. They genuinely mined them. This is probably what you meant but it's good to be specific otherwise people spread FUD about what can happen in 51% attacks on other coins.EDIT: I guess they could double spend which is a form of creating coins out of thin air. Spending them once, rolling back, then spending them again. Is that what happened? Correct, transaction fees are currently used to build the pool reserves. I'm not sure what this is referring to.Thanks. Any chance of getting the rest of the information I asked for? It would be most useful. Given that there are miners mining with 100+ GH/s I don't think that's true. Again, what miner are you using. Do you have backup pools configured. Can you paste, PM or email the command line and/or configuration file you use for the pool. There's obviously something wrong with either your setup or the pool's setup such that it doesn't like something your mining software is doing and it'd be good to work out what it is. No, that shouldn't be the delay. It would help to track down what's happening if you can email admin@bitparking.com with:1) Your pool username2) What miner your are using3) Have you got any backup pools configured4) Logs of a mining session that include lost shares. Something about 30 minutes long should cater for the delay. The more detailed the logs the better but anything that includes submitted/rejected/accepted is helpful. If you could also let me know the timezone of the logs so I can match up with what's in the database that'd help.Thanks! You have not. You have not answered the questions I asked to track down the problem. Your response to my questions was "Seriously...". That's not being civil. If you really want to resolve the issue then to help find out the issue, please provide the information I asked for:In particular, with regards to logs, if you can provide protocol dumps (cgminer uses "-P") that would be most useful.  There is a number of delays between a share being submitted and stats being shown on the stats page. The page itself is cached by the webserver for a number of seconds to reduce load. This means it is always behind. When you submit a share the share the result of that submit (rejected, accepted) goes into a queue. That share is submitted to the database when the queue is processed. This can take some time depending on pool load, database activities, etc. Once it's processed from the queue the web server can report it. This has been the apparent discrepancy in the times that others have reported issues. Ok, thanks. I misunderstood what it was about from the website. I'm curious why you don't just use namecoin? Block numbers are available here. Block 242,435 is the one referred to. I get quite a few emails and requests for support, it's helpful if you answer questions in a civil tone with the information requested so we can move towards a solution. If you're not willing to do this I suggest you mine elsewhere. It's a lot easier to maintain a fork if you include all the history of the previous coin it was forked from. Without this it's difficult to merge or cherry-pick fixes that are later applied to the original coin. It also makes it hard for auditors to compare your fork vs the original coin to see if any malware or secuity issues were added. To do this now they would have to basically analyse the entire code base from the beginning. If you don't want to provide the entire history of the previous coin then providing the git repository and commit id it was based on is useful. This most recent orphan was caused by a bitcoind issue that an emergency patch was supplied for. The issue caused the bitcoin daemon that the pool daemon was hidden behind to crash due to OOM and the pool daemon no longer received updates. It's unfortunate but not much could be done about bitcoind bugs. The pool was a block behind the mainnet at the time the block was found and it was immediately orphaned on restart of bitcoind when it caught up on mainnet. The  reason the pool lost connection with mainnet is due to a bitcoind issue that I've now patched and applied in the last restart. I'll write more about that when I can. I've left the block as pending to investigate further tomorrow (it's 3:30am here). This is the orphan data btw - block 242435:   Code:{        "address" : "18cSDzSuRa4BtfKNu4qAPfeiS57uC9kER4",        "category" : "orphan",        "amount" : 25.05510000,        "confirmations" : 0,        "generated" : true,        "txid" : "a5bae820979fa82783a665e1e1bef5f091b655a608ef3cd121f10fb9ad8bae18",        "time" : 1371729118,        "timereceived" : 1371729138}, Had to do a quick bitcoind update to fix pool issues over the last couple of hours. You'll have seen a few restarts during that time. I'm working through all the mails I've had. Some haven't had responses, this is because I haven't reached your account yet or there is some difficulty recovering your data. The best way you can facilitate your processing is to provide all the information at http://exchange.bitparking.com:If you haven't provided all that, your processing will be slower. If you deposited multiple times to a single address your processing will be significantly slower due to the nature of the recover (I think this is your issue but you haven't provided me with the above to tell - you did read the deposit page about deposit addresses working once only, right?). If you deposited, withdrew or traded during the crash period your processing will be much slower as well. If you have a significant namecoin or bitcoin balance it will also be delayed to confirm the data. Recovery is unfortunately slow and time consuming. I'm doing the best I can. If you have not had a response in the past month you can email/Bitmessage again providing as much information as you can. There was data loss in the namecoin wallet and in the trade database and I'm trying to recover the data which has caused even more delays. I haven't posted progress because whenever I do I get even more enquiries/complaints about progress and I'd rather just work through processing the accounts as a I can. I thank those that have provided positive comments during this process and reported when refunds have happened but I apologise to those still waiting. I don't in general post here or reply to PM's because it just leads to more questions and queries. Emails or Bitmessages are the best approach. Even if I don't respond immediately you'll be put in the queue for processing. Although it is no excuse, this exchange was a hobby project for me to provide namecoin users with a means to get namecoins and the large pump/dump on the day of the crash has made it very difficult to piece trades together. I'm trying my best and working through the queue. Hopefully the responses here where funds have been refunded at least give some idea that this is happening.  You're a bit hard to deal with...things would go faster if you'd just provide the necessary information, especially since you're asking for something outside of what the pool normally does. Your latest email still doesn't include an account name. I need a simple email from you asking for what you want including the account name so I have an audit trail. Thanks. Instead of complaining about it, how about just doing it, so this can be resolved. Sorry, I don't normally respond to PM's and your email probably got buried in your previous ones complaining about PPS vs DGM. The order in which I deal with email and bitmessage is usually:1. People using the pool needing support2. People I'm processing funds recovery requests for the closed exchange3. Everyone else.You're number 3 as you're asking for something that is already covered by pool instructions - the minimum withdrawal fee can be worked around by mining. I need to manage this order otherwise I get drowned in requests by people for "just this one time" to do things like you are asking.Note that I'm not 'refusing to pay'. The pool states there is a minimum payout. By mining you are agreeing to this and you need to mine to reach that minimum to withdraw. The minimum payout of the pool is 0.05 to reduce the cost in fees from a fragmented pool wallet. You know this of course because you've asked me to manually transfer a balance before. At some point in the future I plan to implement automatic withdrawals where small amounts like yours can be processed with zero fees and picked up by the pool when it solves a block. Unfortunately until that time any request for a manual withdrawal depends on my free time.If you have sent an email, I'll process it in due time and can do the manual withdraw then. In the meantime you can either:1) Wait for it to be actioned2) Wait for automatic payments to be enabled3) Mine until you reach 0.05.Edit: I looked in my email pending queue and see an email from a G Lukacs on June 3 requesting a fund withdrawal but they didn't include an account name. If that's you can you do a followup including that information, thanks. This is the first I've heard of this. Are you on getwork or stratum?'unknown-work' means work is being submitted to the pool that it didn't serve. What mining software are you using? Do you have backup pools configured with it? Do you have any logs you can provide to look into it? Fantastic! Thanks for letting me know.
What version of Firefox are you using? You may to enable HTML  video in YouTube by going to https://www.youtube.com/html5. Not all videos are converted and videos that the submitter have marked as requiring ads will still use flash. For the latter to work they're waiting for browsers to support the Media Source Extensions API. This is currently being worked on for Firefox. Firefox supports HTML video using Ogg Theora and WebM video formats. I was one of the developers that implemented the support for those formats in Firefox. Firefox also supports H.264 on some Android Devices, Windows desktop in some builds and on Firefox OS devices. Linux support for H.264 is coming soon via GStreamer. Yes, I delete news that is no longer needed (eg. pool restarts, temporary restrictions, etc) and move pool changes to the "Pool Changes" section. I've made a quick code change and restarted just now. I'd be interested if it makes a difference.Edit: Oops, I lied. I have now definitely made the change and restarted again :-) Thanks these are very useful.

This results in higher fees when those funds are spent. I'll add lowering it to the list of things to investigate though. Are you able to run it with the"-P -D" switches for "protocol dump" and "debug" respectively? You can pipe the output using "2>log.txt". So something like:Code:./cgminer -o ... -u ... -p ... -P -D 2>log.txtIf you can send the log to admin@bitparking.com or see anything relevant in there around the disconnect it would be useful. What miner are you using? cgminer v3.2.1? What withdraw fee? There isn't one. There was a pool restart just now as I rolled back to bitcoin 0.8.1 to see if the recent upgrade is the cause of the instabilities. Share's are kept in a queue and if they fail to transmit to the database server they wait until the database becomes available again. When restarting the pool services this results in a bunch of shares in the queue getting submitted when the database server comes up again and it often shows up as an increase in hash rate like that. Yes, the bitcoind crashed. I'm having a few problems with the recent upgrade to bitcoind 0.8.2. I'm running under the debugger at the moment to try and see what's going on. Worst case I may need to rollback the last update. Yes, back up now. What are the errors you are getting? No, transactions fees are not yet paid out. I've mentioned this before but not all those orphans were real orphans but were the result of the pool paying out on stale submissions that solved a block. I flagged them as orphans in the pool accounting system as it's the only way to note in the reserves that a payment was made but no income received. The bug causing this was fixed before the switch to the pool not paying for orphans.Since the switch there have been two orphan blocks, both genuine close races. The most recent one I think our block was submitted something like 10 seconds after the racing block - not much you can do about that. I've made a configuration change just now. Let me know if it makes a difference. Yes, protocol-dump would be useful,thanks. Getwork server is operational again.
Can you turn on verbose logging of cgminer, including protocol logging, and log to a file? When you get a disconnect like this send me the log and it'll help track it down, thanks. You are correct with regards to your DGM statements. DGM and PPLNS are similar with the former having a few more knobs to tweak to adjust who ends up with the variance (pool vs miner). Stratum server is up. Getwork server is currently offline while I investigate some issues. There will be approximately 5 minutes of downtime in the next hour while I install some bitcoind updates. I have not been able to reproduce the issue since fixing the previous 3.x problem (which I was able to reproduce). I'm still working on seeing if I can find the problem, sorry. The getwork server doesn't support it so I've kept the message there to reduce my support workload for miners who swap between them. It should work on the stratum server fine. The forks I know of were at 14640, 150,000 and 160,000. They have existing issues on the topic of using virtual currencies you might want to read through before asking:https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/14 Namecoin is currently 21THash/s so you'd be doubling it which probably won't have a great effect. A bigger change would be if ixcoin and devcoin were added. They're currently 6 Thash/s. Devcoin's price is very low so it'd be interesting to see what happens when it drops sub-satoshi level.

Made in ChinaThey have the majority hash rate on ixcoin and devcoin.Sometimes it's hard to tell. For example, Eligius still has the MM coinbase but they say they announced they no longer offer merge mining of namecoins to miners so presumably they haven't updated their coinbase for the removal.Software to analyse bitcoin blocks and the associated blocks on the altchains would be useful.  They're also merge mining namecoin, ixcoin and devcoin for the curious. The switch away from pending is currently done manually while I confirm the process works correctly. I'll be making it automatic when I'm confident everything is fine. This means if we find a number of blocks overnight there will be a delay. The distinction is pretty fine. It's considered a stale if the bitcoind that owns the private address that's paid out in the coinbase address never sees the block. It's an orphan if it sees the block and loses a race resulting in the bitcoin noting the payment as 'orphan'.Some pools are big enough to continue building on confirmation 1 blocks and win enough times to make it worthwhile. I think it's generally considered bad form by most pool operators to do this. There's a suspicion that some have done in the past though from discussions I've had with various operators. Do they list the address on their site? I did some digging into why devcoin's difficulty is increasing so much. Vircurex says the hash rate is around 6thash.

This appears to be a bitcoin pool that is currently only identified by the string in the coinbase. An example of a bitcoin block of theirs. I assume from the coinbase string these are the same miners. Looks like they have a substantial hash rate! They could also be the ones dumping coins. Just a small update for bitparking. It stopped paying orphans today so the "Pay Orphans" column should be "No". 140 wasn't really a true orphan, it wasn't actually a valid block but the pool paid out on it anyway so I marked it as orphan. The issue was that the pool would submit a block to multiple bitcoind's and every now and then it is actually stale but one of them would report it as successful due to not having had a new block notification yet and it was being reported as a successful block. It could technically be regarded as an orphan but it's not really since that bitcoind would immediately know when it propogated the block further. Too late for the pool though since it considered it valid. I've closed this loophole now.One advantage of the move to making blocks pending until confirmed is that this sort of issue of "orphan, stale or something else" is avoided since we wait for confirms. I can manually look if needed to see if it was an orphan (racing with another miner) vs was stale but one of the bitcoind's I communicate with didn't know yet. Pool will be going down in 10 minutes or so for updates. It should be up approximately 10 minutes later.Edit: Pool is back up and the orphan changes discussed earlier are implemented.
Right, the payment would be delayed 3 confirmations or so to confirm the block isn't orphaned. The effect of the payments of the next valid block will depend on if the orphan block is short or long. In the longer term this effect is minimized and the the general cost to the miner is the percentage of orphan blocks the pool gets.According to Meni Rosenfeld, the DGM creator, the scores should not be adjusted if an orphan occurs. There's a discussion in the DGM thread about this and you should raise any questions you have there. Here's what Meni says:And later in the thread:It would be nice to have a method that could adjust for orphan blocks and 'make up' payment for them but it's not possible since we can't predict the probability of a block accurately in the presence of orphans. The pool doesn't have a way to 'make up' the cost of orphans and pass that on to miners, other than increasing the fee to approximate the orphan rate. From what I can tell users prefer losing out on orphans but paying a lower fee. This is a heads up that I've written and tested the code to have the pool no longer pay out on orphan blocks as discussed here previously. The way this works is there will be a "Pending BTC Payments" section in the user stats. When a block is found the bitcoin amount earnt is added to that and the block appears as "pending" in the list of solved blocks. When the block is marked "paid" the amount is moved from the "Pending BTC Payments" to the users bitcoin balance and is then available for withdrawal. If the block is marked "orphan" the amount is not added to the bitcoin balance. I'm expecting to set the threshold of confirmations to denote "not orphaned" to be about 3. When I first activate this I'll be processing the payments manually to check that everything is going ok before I automate things so there may some delay in confirmation initially. I'm looking at activating this process sometime in the next 24 hours when I've got a time I can watch the pool constantly to make sure nothing goes wrong.With regards to transaction fees I've not yet enabled the payment of these to users - the pool still keeps them - but I expect to do that in the next day or two once the orphan code has settled.Future updates after this are expected to be:Continue to investigate the pool disconnectoin reports from cgminer 3.x that some users are experiencingUpgrade merge mining bitcoind to 0.8.2. I have the merge mining patches I use converted to 0.8.2 and have done a fair amount of testing and it's working so this won't be too far away. This should provide better pool performance, block propogation and less chance of orphans.Automatic payments over a set thresholdMore stats available from the apisAs always, feedback appreciated. Slush pool only mines namecoins on the getwork interface. Those coins are then paid to all pool users, stratum included. The hash rate of getwork only miners is low making finding a namecoin block hard so payouts are not so often as pools where their entire hashrate is mining namecoins. It's working fine for me - anyone else seeing this issue? Ok, I thought BIP 23 was for the feature discussed here. Why does BIP 23 include the "Logical Services" section? This doesn't seem to have anything to do with the core part of BIP 23. I think it'd be better to trim the BIP to be specific to the task required to make it more understandable and easier to implement. Very nice!  The one I fixed was definitely bitparking specific. I use zeromq to notify the stratum server when a new block has arrived. The stratum server listens on the zeromq socket with a 30 second timeout and sends a notify message then. Unfortunately zeromq on the server was 2.x while I was testing on a 3.x install on my development machine. The 2.x version of zeromq doesn't honour the timeout. So the zeromq listen never timed out. If no blocks on any of the alt chains occurred within 90 seconds then cgminer would disconnect. I think this disconnect rule is new in cgminer 3.x.x which is why it's not seen in 2.x. Rounds should on average equal the difficulty value over time. Currently at our hash rate, from the #mmpool bot:Code:< doublec> !average< mmbot> On average it will take 6.5 hours to find a block at 2238.3 Gh/s. 50% of blocks will be found in 4.5 hours. 95% in 19.4 hours. 99% in 29.8 hours.< mmbot> The pool should earn approximately 92.62 BTC per day. I did notice while I was debugging a number of people connecting to the stratum port with a getwork miner. If your miner has been connecting and constantly getting errors you might want to check this. There were a number of server restarts over the last hour as I worked to track down the cause of the stratum disconnections every 90 seconds occurring with users of cgminer 3 and above. I finally found the issue and have installed a fix. Hopefully there will be no more restarts or disconnections related to that issue.Unfortunately I couldn't reproduce on my test environment as it turns out the issue was due to a third party library version being different on the pool server vs on my testing machine.Feedback on whether the number of "pool interrupted" errors have increased or decreased from here on appreciated. I can't duplicate it locally unfortunately so there will be some restarts as I add debugging to the stratum server and tweak settings.Edit: Logging lots of debug goodness now. I can confirm that I get this with cgminer 3.1.1 but not 2.11.0. I'm attempting to find out what it's doing differently. I've noticed that there's a few more big miners merge mining devcoin. My pool used to get 90% of the blocks, now it's less than 40%. The other miners are probably dumping the coins since I'm not aware of any other pools distributing devcoins to users. Pool luck has been pretty reasonable lately. See the blockstats here. When exactly did your rewards reduce? And are you comparing to PPS, other pools, or historical DGM payout on bitparking? I ran a test mining at difficulty 32 with 14 Mhash and didn't see these disconnections. I am noticing that users reporting it are running cgminer 3.1.x. I'm running 2.11.x. I'll do some testing with the newer version. Perhaps there's some difference in how they're dealing with stratum. The stratum server disconnects users that have no network traffic for a set time. It was 5 minutes, now it's 15 minutes. Is it my imagination or is void_s_life Ender's Game with names changed and paraphrased. Void is Ender. Jewels is Valentine. Dan is Peter. Flob's are the Buggers. Space Fleet are the Astronaughts. The device is the monitor. Stailson is Stilson. How does devtome protect against this sort of thing generally? There was a brief stratum server restart just now while I increased the idle worker timeout to see if it helps with the disconnect messages people are seeing.
Thanks! I'm glad the pools is working out for you.  Blades look nice! I do see a bunch of 0 confirmation payments mixed in with some with 6 confirmations. That's is unusual. Other nodes don't seem to have seen them either. Looks like the transaction propogation had an error. I'll see if they can be resubmitted. Payments should still be instant. Possibly just a network glitch at the time. This is just a visual thing. User balances are still updated immediately. I manually approve the data containing the block number, reward and whether it was orphaned while I'm testing how how that data propogates to make sure it's correct. Miners tend to prefer PPS as it's a guaranteed constant income. Pool operators prefer not to have PPS. DGM, PPLNS and CPPSRB seem popular and non-hoppable. DGM has lots of knobs to turn to adjust from high to low variance on the miner or pool side at a cost of being more difficult to understand. I like it though. Miners seem to find it hard to get a handle on so it can scare people off. With regards to transaction fees, the feedback I've had from miners in my pool is they overwhelmingly want them. My pool pays orphans but keeps fees to cover it but it seems miners prefer it the other way. I'll probably be switching. Donation based pools are fine as long you don't expect any donations. You probably won't get many. You'll want to be able to pay the server costs out of pocket for a while as most funds will be used to keep the pool solvent in the beginning. Even tiny errors can end up costing big and it's hard to recover from an error when pool fees are so low.Stratum-only seems reasonable. GBT is also a fine choice. GetWork is probably on the way out. I've addnoded a bunch of connected servers and send out to a couple of my own nodes that are relatively unconnected from each other (to encourage dispersion of the blocks). Of the four orphans two are actually the result of failure rather than bad block propogation. One due to the slowdown of nodes as the result of spam and another due to a pool bug losing the block before it even got submitted. Both have been fixed or worked around now. Yes, did some minor updates to improve performance in areas and preparing for transaction fee payments. Unfortunately on the restart it failed to send a clean block out so got lots of rejects for 20 seconds or so. Haven't done the update to v0.8.x on the merge mining server yet as it's still in testing. Seems to be working ok though. It's a bit suspicious since the first go at doing the merge of the code changes worked straight away. Something must be wrong! The pool is over 50% devcoin and ixcoin occasionally. There seems to be a couple of other big miners that hop on now and then. Most of the time it's over 50% though for those two coins. What I'm doing is porting the merge mining modifications to the 0.8.2 bitcoin branch. That'll help with the orphans. And I'm also looking at migrating to paying transaction fees but not paying orphans. Most miners seem to prefer that approach that the way I've got it at the moment. Part of the move to the stats, where the full block reward is shown, is the move towards being able to pay transaction fees. I've added to http://mmpool.bitparking.com/blockstats to show the block number, block reward and whether the block was orphaned for the blocks the pool has found. The pool reserves section also now takes into account the transaction fees the pool received whereas before it just assumed 25btc per block.  Merge mining is now active again. Yes, doing the switch. I'm running some tests and will enable in the next 20 minutes or so all going well. I am not seeing this myself. Is anyone else seeing this? What cgminer version are you using? The block download is up to 230,000 so it has not long to go now. Once complete I'll re-enable merge mining. It's taking longer because I disabled the download while on my 14 hour flight back home just in case it impacted the rest of the pool. Not long now until everything is operational again.To prevent this happening again I'm commissioning a second server to operate as a 'hotswap' server. It'll have a mirror of the normal server and enable switching over too it if something goes wrong with the main server with minimal downtime. Not that I'm aware of. What are you seeing? getwork server is back in operation. Still no merge mining while the blockchain is being indexed. Stratum is up again, merge mining is disabled. Currently only bitcoin with DGM is operational. The getwork server is also not up. I'm monitoring stratum for the next few hours to check stales don't happen. I'll enable merge mining again as soon as the blockchain download is complete on the merge mining server. Last night the pool starting having issues due to what I assume was blockchain spam. I had a patch applied to prevent this but the bitcoind was still getting slower and slower. I was on a plane at the time but as soon as I landed and found out what was happening I shut things down then brought it up in non-merge mining mode while I tracked down the issues. While shutting down the main bitcoind process the block index got corrupted. I don't know how or why. This meant having to reload the block index. This operation is still going on. I assume this impacted server load and caused problems with the temporary non-merging mode I setup and it started serving stales overnight. I've now shut the pool down completely while I load the block index and verify everything is ok. I apologise for the inconvenience and hope to have it up as soon as possible. The timing is unfortunate as I'm traveling back home after a work related trip and have been doing this while hopping between airports, hotels and airport lounges. My next flight is 12 hours so I'm hoping this load finishes before then so I can  bring things up before I go offline for that time. Pool is down while I investigate the issues. Pool went down, but it's up now. It's not currently merge mining but is paying the merge mined coins out of reserves while I investigate the issue. 
Can you see the website? Does the getwork interface work? PM me your username and I'll see if you're blocked. I blocked a few people who were constantly mining using 'scrypt'. It's not a bitparking block. We must have shown as the first node to broadcast it that blockchain noticed. You'll notice that most bitparking blocks don't actually appear as bitparking on blockchain.info. The site is pretty inaccurate due to the approach they use. blockorigin is more accurate but it's showing 'unknown' at the moment. It may show who produced it later if it's from a pool that delays stats. You should be seeing the alt coin balances increasing immediately as you submit shares. Bitcoin balance should increase when we find blocks. What's your username (best to PM it)? Are you sure you've spelt it correctly in your miner? Yeah it's a tough time. Over the last 25 blocks we've averaged luck of 0.83. But mostly due to the last 4 long blocks. Before those we averaged 1.02 meaning we were ahead.  We've solved more than one block in two weeks - you should have received more than one reward. This round was a long one but we've had short ones too. Thanks, possibly the page was hit by a web spider. Some point soon I plan to move to automatic payouts over a certain threshold so the pool doesn't hold too many coins. As discussed on irc, the exchange main page has progress information and there's a thread where people complain how slow things are. I'll sort something out to reimburse you but it'll take me a couple of days. There will be 5 minutes more of downtime sometime in the next hour as I apply some fixes for the pool crashes that happened earlier today. Things should be working now. There was some downtime about 3 hours ago, and 6 hours ago, when the bitcoin daemon crashed. I'll investigate the crashes later today. It seems odd for it to be stable right up until now, the switchover day for the block fork code, so I'll be looking in that area.Edit: Belay that, we're going down for 5 minutes. Pool crashed. I'm investigating why but it's back up now. The only other coins the pool could merge mine are coiledcoin, groupcoin and some other whose name I forget (by the same creator as groupcoin). These aren't really actively traded though,except on an OpenTransactions server which I don't know much about. If an exchange took it, possibly, If not, probably not. Pool had a 5 minute restart today to install some updates. You can tell it's from Bitparking anyway since I have "Bitparking" in the coinbase. Pool user br*********at ('*' replaces name characters to avoid revealing your user id), you are mining on stratum using an scrypt miner and all your shares are rejecting. You might want to check. Bitparking pushes the new block out to multiple bitcoin nodes. Depending on which of those broadcasts the block first it gets a different IP address and blockchain.info won't show it as coming from 'Bitparking'.  Nor does DGM. The Slush scoring method has got people thinking that "hop proof" means "must mine continuously". What is this 5 round thing you are writing about? Where in DGM do they mention 5 rounds? Note this point in the DGM article: Their seed nodes are down. You need to find and connect to an existing node. If you can fire up your old node and connect to that to get the  blockchain and node addresses to bootstrap.
Vircurex is suffering an issue: It will look like you are losing because your new account will be 'charging the capacitor'. But at the same time the old account will be discharging and the two will add up such that nothing is lost. You can keep your old account if you use the email me/signing thing I discussed earlier. Just don't withdraw before then. 8337 is the ixcoind port. For devcoin I'm using 9333, sorry. I don't know where it's getting port 52333 from. It should be port 8337. Where did you get the source from? Try:Code:ixcoind -addnode=50.116.37.18:8337 Try adding 50.116.37.18 as a node for both DVC and IXC:Code:ixcoind -addnode=50.116.37.18I'll try and get something together for this in the coming week. Ok, I'm going to do a one off fix for this issue. If users email admin@bitparking.com or bitmessage BM-BbgTgGa6LX3yYqwJSwdwrzysvfWjM2u6 with the following:Your account nameYour bitcoin address registered with that nameI will reply with a message you need to sign using your bitcoin address. For those of you who do not have the private keys for any of the addresses I'll deal on a case by case basis via email/bitmessage. What you should do now though is register a new account with new coin addresses that you own. The other approach I've considered is setting up my own coin wallet service for people to generate addresses, withdraw, etc. Keeping this separate from the pool enables those who manage their own keys to be as secure as possible while the wallet service would be for those that don't care. Someone hacking the wallet service wouldn't affect the pool for example. This could be a possibility in the future if someone else doesn't do it. Right, every time I think "I should move to coinbase payments" my other inner voice says "but then you have the support cost of explaining to all existing users to register new non-exchange accounts".  Thanks for the kind words and ideas. I don't have plans to add passworded accounts as I see this as a differentiator with Bitparking - the owner of the private keys for the registered account owns the funds and it can't be changed. The Vircurex issue shows this has a downside but for those that own their own private keys they know they're safe. If I move to automatic withdraws and/or generated coins in the coinbase then even the pool wouldn't own the coins. Transaction fee payout is something I'm considering but if I do that I'll have to change to not paying orphans. Basically the transaction fees pays for the orphans - or so I'm hoping - over time. So far the pool is in debt in that area due to two early orphans when switching to DGM but we'll see. It seems that paying tx fees might be perceived as a better deal than paying orphans by users and it'll be worth switching. Yes, this is a problem. Bitparking has read only addresses and the owner of the private key for the registered address basically owns the funds. What you might be able to do is ask Vircurex for the private key for the addresses. You could import these into your own client, withdraw, then immediately transfer. It's unlikely any hacker is constantly monitoring the alt coin wallets. It may not be possible for Vircurex to provide this though.You don't need to run all alt-coins all the time on your own machine. You can run once, get an address, register with that and never run the client again until you want to use the funds. You can even withdraw from bitparking without needing to run your client. This is how I do things.Someone asked me if they could sign a message using one of the keys (ie. the  bitcoin key) to prove ownership of the other addresses and have them changed. The problem with this is it leaves the pool open to social engineering. If the bitcoin key was kept on Vircurex too I don't know if it's the hacker then trying to withdraw funds from the pool. It's a bad situation. I'm open to suggestions. Yes, this has been catered for  Definitely. I used to use AJAX to provide an updating hash rate back in the early days and my bandwidth and load was immense. I assume people just left it open in a browser tab and forgot about it. Sure, I'd be interested. I have zero design skills  I took it down because someone complained that it was lagged and missing shares. I can bring it back if there's interest. Try WebSnap or WidgetMaker. They allow taking snapshots of websites and putting them on a widget on your homescreen that is regularly updated. They're pretty neat. I use them for monitoring some internal pool data. Thanks! A difficulty of 1-2 per ghash is reasonable I think. Yes there's more to come with regards to stats and work on the pool. If you search in the Android Play store you'll see a Bitparking app with widget that a contributor created. I'm planning to use Pushover for notifications of workers going offline - it's what I use myself for block notifications and the pool being down. Lately it's been a rush to get Stratum going, then transitioning from PPS. Now I hope to get some time to improve other things. Yes, there was a transaction with 3.2 BTC of fees in the block. Yes it was. You'll notice though that the subsequent blocks have been paying 25+ BTC even if they were solved early to work towards making it up. The last 7 blocks have averaged a payout of 275 satoshi per share vs PPS payout of 236 (PPS of 5% fee). The last 16 blocks have averaged 222 Satoshi which isn't far off the 236 PPS. Adding an extra 10% for the alt coins gives a 244 satoshi payout which is more than the 236 PPS and you can currently get more than 10% selling the alts. But that 60 hour block is definitely hurting. Without that we'd be at 290 satoshi per share (without the alts!). A few more short blocks should start seeing things even out.
Thanks, much appreciated! This is now fixed. User id's are case sensitive. Look up the stats for "Wave". Which stats? The 'score' count should be increasing and the 'estimate' should show the estimate of what you'll earn. Oops, thanks. There's also one when the user has no shares submitted in a round, I'll fix those in the next update. I don't know why it wouldn't be workig. Trying a newer version and seeing if that changes things is all I can suggest. That would be this thread. The 16% extra is not from Bitminter. The person quoting the original data posted results from another pool which merge mines more than just namecoin. For Bitminter it would be the namecoin % only which was 8%. What version of cgminer? What error you getting? Connection information looks fine. Coin designers should use a better difficulty adjustment algorithm. PPCoin and Devcoin seem to be handling asics coming and going well. My pool was mining devcoins and dropped from 5 THash/s to 1THash/s on devcoin and it barely caused a blip in block times. If  coin designers make their coins merge mineable then MM pools can mine it and help reduce the effect of asics causing havoc. I have definitely considered it - especially now that the pool hash rate is lower, running a second pool isn't such an additional load. The main thorny point with freicoin is dealing with demurrage on user balances that are held. Yep. To be a primary coin you don't need any blockchain changes - just software to correctly manage the alt coins and store data in the coinbase of the primary chain. Tweaking namecoins merge-mine-proxy can do this. Pity Freicoin can't be merge mined, I'd definitely be adding it to the pool. Some results from the !exchange command in #mmpool:Code:< mmbot> NMC is 0.00915001 BTC per NMC at Vircurex, we earn 221.383927344 NMC per bitcoin block = 2.02566514904 BTC or 8.1% additional BTC per block< mmbot> IXC is 0.000189 BTC per IXC at Vircurex, we earn 7036.7594417 IXC per bitcoin block = 1.32994753448 BTC or 5.32% additional BTC per block< mmbot> DVC is 2.08e-06 BTC per DVC at Vircurex, we earn 366497.887589 DVC per bitcoin block = 0.762315606184 BTC or 3.05% additional BTC per block< mmbot> Total extra BTC per block is 4.1179282897 or 16.47% extra incomeSeems a lot. Someone want to check the math? Recently I switched from PPS to DGM payment methods which unfortunately coincided with a run of long blocks resulting in a bunch of asic's leaving the pool. Bitparking is at 600 Ghash/s now. More asic's would obviously be welcomed. Isn't Coinotron using DGM for bitcoin payments? Finally got past the long block, block 234756 was found. Here's hoping for some shorter rounds and better luck. Block withholding is always a legitimate concern, especially on PPS pools. In my darker moments as I was watching my PPS reserve whittle away I was wondering if some asic devices weren't block withholding since it's in their best interests to do so (helps stop difficulty increasing but they get the same reward). I did check to make sure the big miners were actually solving bitcoin blocks occasionally. That's the paranoia I mentioned in my previous post. The variance in mining really is quite large and it's possible to have long periods of the wrong side of it. Believe me this always goes through an operators mind during long rounds. Paranoia sets in. I have checked and things are fine. We're solving namecoin blocks at a normal rate for example. We're just not finding hashes close enough to the bitcoin target. The best hash we've found so far is:Code:00000000000001d26460346f49a03d529a843b1603e90507824582f2edb98b7f <= so far00000000000001AA3D0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 <= bitcoin targetWe've had a bunch close to that but nothing over. Currently luck is around 19%. We've had worse (about 14% I think). I'm sure other pool operators have had worse too. OzCoin had a 100+ million share round recently. It's definitely not the best timing just as we switch to DGM scaring a bunch of high hash rate miners off unfortunately but what can you do.
It does with DGM. In longer rounds slightly more is paid in an attempt to offset the pain of the long round. In shorter rounds less is paid to help the pool build up a buffer. You can see this reflected in the existing payouts on that page. This is in turn affected by the variance the pool has been experiencing in that future rounds will pay more to make up for the lesser amounts paid in the unlucky rounds.The actual effect of the adjustments is controlled by the parameters the pool operator chooses for o, f and c as described in the double geometric method post. The parameters I picked result in up to approximately 5.8 BTC extra per block payout to correct for variance/long rounds. That's why you're seeing the existing estimate increasing much more slowly around the 30BTC value. My redownload has now got the non-dead chain. Hopefully that one will disappear as nodes using it go offline. Bitparking also pays for orphans. This is what the transaction fees go towards - keeping an orphan buffer. If the network has averaged 1% orphans in the last 12 months then the 1.5% fee at bitparking is really only 0.5%. Add to that the income from the alt coins and the fee is negative. Disclaimer: I'm a tad biased... I'm curious why a reorg never happened. I've taken my node with what I assume is the dead chain offline and am trying to redownload a new blockchain. I'll see what one I end up getting. Thanks, that's what one of my nodes gets. The other has:Code:coiledcoind getblockhash 179577c4720651f8f96152894218250efad3266110b378689209b671f13c94285993f9coiledcoind getblockcount183496It hasn't seen a block since 18th April though so whatever node that was feeding it might be gone. Thanks, it'll be interesting to see what happened. Both nodes on different chains that I run have all the blocks from the other chain but they're orphaned. Neither are doing a block reorg to the others chain though. Did coiledcoin have a limit to stop large reorgs? I did some analysis of two diverging coiledcoin chains. They diverged at block 179577. Both chains have hash 0277f8ea8189d5e18aabe669226375492fc58ec0d30b14a9b6cc0b79c1bab8ba as block 179576. But for block 179577 one chain has c4720651f8f96152894218250efad3266110b378689209b671f13c94285993f9 and the other e654dad298eeccbcd74e90804a5ac1583a875a4fd08ed4e90844e44cd6806e34.So here's a question for the coiledcoin users (all 2 of you?). What is the output of:Code:coiledcoind getblockhash 179577And what is your current block number:Code:coiledcoind getblockcountI'm curious why it forked there. Some OP_EVAL transaction causing a fork maybe? I've fixed the duration wraparound. You are pretty much correct. Past events have no effect on future events. You can't jump onto an unlucky pool based on an assumption that their luck must turn and therefore you'll be mining at a lucky period for example. Even if you prefer PPS this is bad for a PPS pool you mine at. Then the pool takes on this bad luck and eventually disappears. The timer wrapped. I'm not showing days, I'll add that. I didn't think it'd be much of an issue when the pool was 5+Th/s The low hash rate makes it look like this is a long block. Luck is currently 30% (that's difficulty divided by number of shares). That's not excessively long. We've had luck lower than 15% before. But that was at a higher hash rate so the actual time for the round was only 12 hours or so. Now it seems much worse because of the longer time to solve. I have no ETA when all accounts will be processed.  There's now a #mmpool irc channel on freenode irc for those that want to discuss the pool or get support. That's the one I worked from, yes. For the curious you can use Wolfram Alpha to compute the buffer from Meni's paper. At 5% PPS, with a 1 in 1000 risk of ruin, you need 1,726 BTC in reserve. Replace the '1000' and the '0.05' in that URL to change the risk of ruin and percentage fee respectively. Absolutely! Bitparking no longer does PPS. It's DGM only from here on out so you might want to remove the PPS entry. Thanks! It looks like there's a network issue between the 'stratum2' server and the pool backend which is causing the problem. I'm looking into it but in the meantime I'll disable the stratum2 functionality. I've changed the DNS to point to the mmpool server and will shut it off when it has propogated. Thanks for pointing out the issue!Edit: I'll also try the same mining software you are using to see if there's some incompatibility. Ok, thanks. I'm going to take stratum2/dgm2 out of rotation and see if I can find out what's going wrong with those servers. It sounds like 'mmpool.bitparking.com:3333' and 'mmpool.bitparking.com:4333' are fine? You mention '15098' but that's the getwork server.Edit: What miner are you using? Can you give me the exact servers you are connecting to. There is no "non DMG strat" anymore. If you can resolve the memory issues I'd be willing to add it to the merge mining pool. I agree conditions involving third parties make the bounty less attractive.
I've thought of a few possibilities to bring some form of PPS back without needing large reserves. One approach might be to split the 25 BTC reward so that 5BTC is distributed via PPS and 20  BTC via DGM (or whatever split). A single share gets a PPS payment computed from the value of the 5 BTC and a DGM share at the value of the 20 BTC. At 5 BTC provided for PPS and a 5% fee the pool would need a 230 BTC reserve to cover that with a 1 in 100 risk of ruin. This provides at least some regular, no need to wait for a block, type of earning with a chunk that becomes available when a block is found via DGM. The split could be adjusted based on reserves the pool has. What are the thoughts of something like this? If you can provide the funds for the reserve I'll switch it on now. blockchain.info doesn't pick up all the blocks. You're better off using blockorigin. There's also the stats.csv which is the block file I provide for the weekly pools thread. The pool has had a bad run of luck, especially in the last two weeks. This is a major reason for providing DGM. I don't have the funds to keep a reserve of PPS going through the bad luck period. It does vary a a lot though. The last difficulty period I think I was about 1.4x difficulty overall. The period before that I was about 0.9x difficulty. The process of paying transaction fees is almost as tricky with DGM. I don't know of any DGM pools that pay it - are there any? It's still on my radar to investigate though.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1A social engineering hack attempt was attempted on the bitparking server this morning. The attacker attempted to convince my hosting site that they were me, and successfully gained access to the customer service portal. They used this to raise support requests to gain access to the server. No access to the server itself was available through the portal and they did not succeed in gaining access to the server as I was able to communicate to the hosting provider about what was going on.The attacker registered a domain name, "chrisdouble.co.nz", as part of the social engineering attempt to gain access. This domain name is not owned or affiliated with me. If anyone attempts to contact you regarding bitparking services you should be wary that this may be a social engineering attempt. I can be reached on the bitparking Bitmessage address shown at the bottom of the pool's main page if you want to confirm my identity. My GPG fingerprint is also available on the bitcoin otc and I can sign messages with GPG to confirm information if you need confirmation messages are from me.Some bitparking services are currently disabled while I deal with cleaning up issues related to the attack and tighten some things up. Most notably the PPS servers are offline and traffic is being redirected to the DGM servers. The bitparking hot wallet is at the bare minimum needed to service DGM blocks as they arrive. My apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.If you use other bitcoin services be aware that they may be targets of similar social engineering attacks. At least one other pool, BTCGuild, has had an attempt using the same method and you can read about that in their thread. The attacker in my case attempted to pass off that they were the 'toil' or 'Josh Rogers' identity that was possibly involved in the OzCoin hack so it's possible these are done by the same party.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)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M3rf-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- In the meantime, pool is up with one dgm server running while I resolve these issues and attempt to bring the others online. If anyone receives email from chrisdouble.co.nz, domain registered today, that is not me. Someone is currently trying to break into the pool server via social engineering with my hosting provider. I'm working on it and in discussion with my hosting provider. Pool is back up but the PPS servers are having issues. I've temporarily redirected them to DGM while I investigate.Edit: And we're down again, sigh. I'll comment here when we're stable. Pool is back up now.Edit: And we're down again. Investigating. Crashed bitcoind. I'm in the process of restarting it. The chance of solving a single share is constant. So it suits a miner to mine that share wherever it can get the highest price. On a proportional pool, that pays out blockvalue divided by totalshares, the hopper will want to mine wherever the total number of shares are lowest. Say there are two pools, one with 10 total shares so far and one with a million. It would be better for the hopper to mine at the pool with 10 total shares as it would get 1/11 of the block value if it finds the block. It would only get 1/1,000,001 if it found it in the second pool. So the hopper moves around mining at whatever pool has the lowest number of shares, which will be one that has found a block most recently. So the hopper is getting more money this way than if they weren't hopping. This means the miners that aren't hopping are getting less money due to the actions of the hopper.The pool loses out too because it gets a huge influx of hashrate at the beginning of the round and then, as it goes longer, it drops off leaving it with a low hashrate and even less chance of finding a block. Other miners get disillusioned and leave. I think these are the main arguments made for those that think hopping is bad. Luck is difficulty divided by number of shares for the round. So it's luck for the round (current block being mined). The funds are not mixed.I've posted on http://exchange.bitparking.com the details of what is happening. Have you sent me a bitmessage asking for progress? They get responded to more quickly for status requests and general enquiries simply because of the volume of mail going to admin@bitparking.com. There are *thousands* of emails and recovery requests. Each one takes time to recover the state of transactions and data. I'm doing the best I can to recover the data and work through the queue. PM me your email address and I'll see where you stand. I don't see anything obvious received from 'human'. I can give you the reasons why I don't do it, but understand that there is no right approach. Anyone can do whatever scratches their own person itch. The pool is designed to protect alt coin chains via merge mining and to distribute these coins to users who want to get them via mining. Their use of the coins will hopefully (if they don't immediately sell) help with the exchange rate of the coins. If I were to only provide bitcoin and receive fees via selling the alt coins then my selling would dump the alt coin market and drop their prices quite a bit. I'd also be tied to the risk that the alt coin prices drop, or the alt coins fail, making the pool lose money while offering a zero percent fee. This is the last 'justification' post I'm going to contribute to this thread because it's completely unproductive. Any answer is a 'right' answer depending on individual miners wants and needs. That's why it's great having so many pools to choose from. User stats now have round duration and time/duration on the list of previous payments. I don't know, sounds like a good project for you to investigate. Yes, that is how it works: http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/273/how-does-merged-mining-work Yes, if you've registered an address for them. They are calculated the same as PPS in bitcoin, but with a 2.5% fee.
EMC doesn't merge mine, so you are missing out on income from namecoins,devcoins, and ixcoins. EMC doesn't pay orphans, Bitparking does which eats into the fee quite a bit. It may be that none of this matters to you in which case, yes, EMC might be a better pool for you. Some pool payment methods, notably PPS, pay per share contributed and make the funds available for withdrawal immediately. This means the pool is taking on the risk of blocks being found in a timely manner. To do this they need funds to cover the unlucky pool periods. Fees can reduce the reserve needed for the pool to avoid becoming bankrupt (unable to pay miners). a 2.5% fee PPS pool needs at least 2,302 BTC]http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=25*%28ln%28100%29%29%2F%282*0.025%29]2,302 BTC in reserve to have a 1 in 100 chance of bankruptcy.The 'threshold' you refer to is most likely the 120 block confirmations required before a block can have its funds spent. This means either the miner has to wait 120 blocks before they can withdraw the funds, or the pool lets them do it out of the reserves and recoups after the threshold.Most pool owners would keep any pool reserves in cold storage with some in the hot wallet for withdrawals. Did you register addresses for the other coins? You only receive rewards for coins you have registered. As it says on the registration form "Enter a namecoin address or leave blank to receive none." Yes, you are missing something. The pool 'merge mines', it doesn't mine each coin individually. This means a single hash from your miner is used to solve blocks across all the coins. See here: http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/273/how-does-merged-mining-work A bitparking user not happy with the fee increase on PPS asks, Why do pools charge fees?. My response is here. The fee is to pay for costs of operating the pool, build reserves for operating the PPS side of things, and to pay for the time involved in support and upkeep of the pool.You are complaining about the increase in PPS but higher PPS fees are necessary to keep pools in operation. Did you read the part of my "Upcoming Changes" that explained the reserve requirements for PPS pools? Do you have The 3,000 BTC necessary to keep a reserve for a low fee pool? PPS pools can pay hundreds of BTC of funds keeping the PPS pool going through the bad luck periods. I need to raise the fees to reduce the chances of pool bankruptcy. Just like all the other low fee PPS pools like Mt Red and Ozcoin.Why do some other pools have 0% fees? I don't know - maybe they get subsidized hardware to run it. Maybe they have plenty of money and it doesn't matter to them what it costs.As a miner you are free to choose where to mine. Have fun choosing. Yes, it's on the list of things to do. It makes the "past blocks" stats a bit less useful without it. Some Bitparking changes.We've added DGM:Fee: 1.5%Pay Tx Reward: NoVariable difficulty: user definedLocal work: stratumPay Orphans: yesASIC Ready: yesMerged Mining: yesThe PPS side of things has changed the fee to 3.5% for bitcoin and kept it at 2.5% for altcoins. The bitcoin fee is gradually increasing to 5% however so you might as well just put that. PPS bad luck streaks have been a killer. Yet another long block. The last 5 blocks have averaged 2.4x difficulty, ouch. As discussed above, I've implemented the first part of the switch. The getwork mining is now on DGM and the stratum headers it sends points to the DGM stratum servers. The first PPS fee increment has happened, increasing to 3.5%. Some users have expressed concern that DGM earnings are lower than on PPS. The last 5 blocks, since announcing DGM, have averaged 2.4x difficulty which is why PPS payments seem high compared to DGM. Once we get some shorter blocks it'll even out. I've kept the alternate coin PPS rate at 2.5% for now. I've just added DGM to my pool, and yes there's a learning curve. Since introducing it the pool hasn't solved a block with less than 1x difficulty shares for the last 6 or so blocks. The new DGM users are struggling with the concept of lower earnings why they'd be earning more on PPS. It's probably easier with a pool that starts with DGM vs switching. So, now the good news of DGM being implemented is announced...here comes the bad news. As I've mentioned before the motivation for implementing this was to reduce PPS usage to reduce pool risk and not require a large reserve to avoid pool bankruptcy. This is my current thinking on the changes to be made. Comments welcome.With PPS the pool is taking the brunt of high variance and bad luck. This places great strain on the pool reserves. The high cost of bitcoins makes it difficult to purchase the amounts necessary to enable a stable reserve to reduce the risk of bankruptcy. To get a 1 in 100 chance of bankruptcy a 2.5% fee PPS pool needs 2,302 BTC in reserves. At 5% it needs 1,151 BTC reserve.The risk of ruin is too high at the current 2.5% rate and I want to see the pool continue. When prices were low it wasn't so bad since I could just purchase more coins for the reserve, not so much now. To that end I plan to increase the PPS fee to 5%. This will happen in increments of about 1% per day for the next 3 days to give miners a chance to notice and either switch to DGM, which has a 1.5% fee, or change to another pool.  The getwork server will switch over to using the DGM method and will not offer PPS. It will by default refer stratum supporting miners to the stratum DGM server. Users that want to mine at the higher fee on the PPS server can connect directly to the PPS stratum server.Some features to note of DGM:Your earnings work like a capacitor. When you start mining it needs to charge so initial earnings are lower than expected. When fully charged they reach a normal level of earning. When you stop mining you continue to receive earnings until it is discharged. The end result should be equivalent to PPS with a 1.5% fee.Payments are made to your balance when a block is found. If the round is short you may get more than the PPS rate. If a series of long rounds occurs then your payments may be less than PPS. Overall it will average out.The risk to the pool is much lower making it more likely to survive while balancing with low variance for miners. These parameters (more risk to pool, less to miners) can be tweaked and we can adjust it over time.At 1.5% fee you should earn more on DGM than PPS with consistent mining.The DGM server will continue to pay orphans as if they hadn't occurred. I'll need to monitor the orphan rate here to see if the fee needs to be adjusted for it.The math behind the Double Geometric Method is explained in this bitcointalk postStratum users can switch between the 5% PPS and the 1.5% DGM any time by switching to the right server:DGM: stratum+tcp://mmpool.bitparking.com:4333DGM: stratum+tcp://stratum2.bitparking.com:4333DGM: http://mmpool.bitparking.com:15098PPS: stratum+tcp://mmpool.bitparking.com:3333PPS: stratum+tcp://stratum2.bitparking.com:3333        The alternate coins that are merge mined will continue to be paid using PPS whether you are mining on a DGM or a PPS server. I may revisit whether to change these to DGM at a later time but for now the pool has adequate reserves. Pool is back up. Let me know if you find any issues. Just a reminder that the pool will be unreachable for 10 minutes or so as my service provider does some network maintenance. This happens in about 5 minutes. The d=x customizable difficulty does work with DGM. Yes, the default difficulty on the stratum servers is 16 and I recommend you lower it or increase it as needed. I'd really like to implement automatic difficulty adjustment at some point.The PPS and DGM pools are working together. This way DGM miners don't need to wait weeks for a block to be found because of a smaller hash rate. The PPS pool contributes to DGM but when it comes to DGM payout time the PPS amount isn't paid out since miners are compensated at share submission time for the actual PPS rate. Here's an example of how that works. Currently we have a total of these shares:Code:PPS: 11,032.272DGM:    387,956The estimated DGM stats are:Code:All PPS miners:  27.05527705All DGM miners:  1.07672230Total:               28.13199935You'll notice the estimated payment for DGM miners divided by the number of shares is an effective PPS rate of 277.5 satoshis which is slightly above the actual PPS of 272 due to the fee and the block solve luck. It'll be because they've found more shares in total and the capacitor is fuller. It also depends on when they mined. The payout they're getting will depending how much of short blocks and long blocks they participated in. Overall it'll average out. I wrote the following to help clear it up to someone in email: On Sunday, 28 April 2013 at 09:20:00 the pool will have 5-10 minutes of downtime as my hosting provider does some network maintenance. During this time the pool won't be reachable so please ensure you have a backup set. Congrats to the last two 50k score DGM winners, '70421325' and '227164b6', who got paid a 2 BTC and 1 BTC bonus respectively. Thanks to all for participating! Not at this stage, no. I plan to run for a while and ensure that fees cover the DGM operation taking into account the fact that the pool pays for orphans - I don't think other DGM pools do this. I'll revisit the decision after that.  They still use PPS. Mining on DGM will still earn the alt coins but the rewards for them are given using PPS. I may offer DGM for them later but I'll see how DGM goes with BTC for now. Congrats to number 3 in the 50k DGM club, '6600bcec', who has been paid a 4 BTC bonus. Yes, it was supposed to be 3 BTC but I misclicked, oops. Only two to go and the next share values close to 50k are close. 21560, 20452, 20128 and 17,853.
Congrats to '255e8151' who hit 50,000 shares and has been paid a 4BTC bonus. The next 3 getting close to 50k have share values of 45400, 20,800, and 19,800. I've made the necessary pool changes to make the DGM share count accurate and this will be rolled out after the next block or so. You'll then see the number of shares for the DGM payments and the PPS payments separately on the page and the API. Yes, good idea. I'll add that.  4 BTC then 3 BTC, 2 BTC, 1 BTC, then it's done. Last DGM related pool change for a bit. I've added a "last 5 payments" to the user stats page. This shows the actual amount of BTC paid for the last few blocks. I'll clean up the look of this later, I just wanted to get something quick out there. Can you PM me your ip address? I banned a range from someone attempting a mass SQL injection attact and you may be caught up in it.Edit: Actually if you can't reach stratum2.bitparking.com then it's not that. What error are you getting? Congrats to '6a407671' who hit 50,000 shares and has been paid a 5BTC bonus. The next 4 getting close to 50k have share values of 32000, 14,600, 14,400 and , 7800. I put some DGM stats here. Note that the 'score' shown in the estimates is an estimate and could be off by a few. The score in the payouts should be accurate however. What this doesn't show is the effect of the PPS miners. All the PPS miners effectively contribute to DGM so the pool has an internal PPS user that accrues DGM value. If there's interest I can show that too. I'm not quite sure the best way to display or word it though. I've added a temporary stat to the user page that shows the total number of DGM shares mined so you can see how close to the 50,000 you are. Thanks to the following users who get 1 btc for being the top 5 share submitters on the dgm stratum node (Usernames are the first 8 characters of the sha256 hash of their username):6a407671: 6188f4b05c10: 296857a22ab2: 1416a5d78fff: 1360906b1bc4: 6231 BTC has been sent to the bitcoin address associated with these users accounts. I'm opening the DGM server for wider testing. To mine on the DGM server with stratum use stratum+tcp://mmpool.bitparking.com:4333. Note the '4333' at the end instead of '3333' which is the PPS server. The details of the DGM server are:1.5% feef=-0.23125c=0.2o=0.8Details about DGM (and what 'c' and 'o' mean) are available at the Double Geometric Method forum post. Unlike PPS, where constant payments are made for each share, your DGM balance works like a capacitor. When you first start earning the amount is lower while the capacitor charges. When fully charged the earnings are more regular. When you stop mining the capacitor discharges and you still get paid for a period afterwards. So don't panic if earnings seem lower at the beginning. Even if you stop mining on DGM you'll continue to accrue DGM amounts where you'll catch up. Stastically you should earn more on DGM due to the lower fee. Due to the way DGM operates payments are made when a block is found. You will see a "DGM Estimated Round Payout (BTC)" in your user statistics page. This is the estimated amount of BTC you are likely to earn when a block is found. You'll notice this will have a value in future blocks even when you stop mining due to the capacitor approach described before. You can switch between PPS and DGM any time.Feedback on DGM, the stats shown, and the parameter settings the pool is using, are welcomed. Note that this is experimental and if there are issues let me know so I can track them down. I reserve the right to shut the DGM server down should I find a major problem so you should set up a backup server. If I shut DGM down I'll redirect to a PPS server.First user that hits 50,000 DGM shares and emails/bitmessages/PM's me to confirm gets a 5 BTC bonus sent to their registered BTC address for helping test. Second, third, fourth and fifth get 4, 3, 2 and 1 BTC respectively but remember you need to email/bitmessage/PM me so I can confirm to be eligible! If I have to close DGM early due to issues I'll apportion based on nearest hash rates to 50,000 at the time.Edit: I'll also throw in 1 BTC each to the top 5 highest score submissions on the DGM server as at Saturday, 27 April 2013 00:00:00, GMT. That's two hours from now. This should give the lower hash rate, but early testers, a chance for a reward.Edit 2: 40 minutes to go until the 1 BTC awards mentioned in the edit. Currently the top five have 2720, 2080, 864, 546 and 258 shares. Thanks for testing! I have a devcoin seed node running at Code:dcnode.bitparking.com. This connects to my mining pool node which is mining Devcoin at about 4 Thash/s so gets notification of new blocks fairly quickly. My devcoin address is 1KXrxx7skEeTapMZiV67MHo699hS6BrcEZ. I fired up my coiledcoin client a few weeks ago to see if it was still alive but noticed there were multiple chains. One client I connected with had a block count ahead of the blockchain explorer, with different hashes for the blocks with the same numbers as the explorer, but another client I connected with on a different machine matched the block explorer. Neither chain reorg'd when connected to each other. New stats added to the user page and the userstats JSON API:Shares for round. This is the number of equivalent difficulty 1 shares submitted since the last block foundPPS for round. This is the number of BTC earned from the PPS system since the last block found. If you haven't done any DGM mining (when it's enabled) this should be the 'shares for round' multipled by the current BTC rate - assuming difficulty hasn't changed mid round.DGM Estimated Round Payout. This is the estimated amount of BTC that would be earned when the next block is found for the shares submitted to the DGM system. The main page also shows the hash rate going towards the DGM reward system (not currently enabled, still in testing). Wallets refilled, withdrawals are now working. Pool is back up. I've defragmented the wallets and they're currently empty. I'll be sending the funds from the old wallets shortly then withdrwals can resume. Pool down for 10 minutes for a coin daemon upgrade. Hello IP address 46.165.208.105, nice try running a script to try and SQL inject user logins. but please don't test the security of the pool without asking me, thanks. There's a miner on the main stratum server that is sending invalid hashes and getting H-not-zero responses as a result. It looks like they haven't noticed. The hashes look to be scrypt based. If You are user "Lxxxxxe" ('x' are other characters, blanked out to prevent revealing the name) then you might want to check your configuration. It looks like you have an asic and it's being wasted.There are two miners on the stratum2 server that appear to be asics but are forcing a difficulty of 1. This is causing quite a large bandwidth usage on the server. I've forced that stratum server to send a minimum of difficulty 8 shares as a result. If you're on that server please check your password to see if you're configured for difficulty one shares. Thanks, I appreciate the kind words. At the moment I'm planning to add DGM to the pool and offer both PPS and DGM. The choice of which reward scheme you want would be based on the server you mine on. I will probably have a higher fee for PPS and a lower fee for DGM. I'm running DGM at the moment in testing and it seems to be working fine. Thanks, I assume the 'r' used in that calculation should be calculated using a 'p' adjusted for the difficulty of the share that solved the block too?
Is the 'p' used here '1.0/D' or is it 'd/D' (where d is user's difficulty of submitted share). If it's 'd' how is it affected if a user has their difficulty changed part way through a block? Is it the 'd' for the most recent share submission? The pool had another 4x difficulty block, continuing its run of bad luck. Thankfully it was followed by a couple of short blocks putting us back to averaging 1.5x difficulty since the difficulty change. After seeing what's happened to Ozcoin, where a PPS bad luck run caused reserve issues and they had to disable PPS, I've re-enabled my DGM payment method testing code and am running that alongside PPS to test and compare results.I may offer DGM alongside with PPS at some point, or leave it there to enable a switchover if PPS bad luck results in pool reserves getting dangerously low. I like PPS for its simplicity but I'd rather switch to DGM than go bankrupt if the reserves run low. Normally I'd just buy more reserves but the bitcoin price has risen so high since I started the pool that's not really an option when block swings can be 10,000 USD. There were some pool restarts in the last 20 minutes while I added some statistics and monitoring data. This hasn't changed, all addresses remain read only. To add an address you need to create a new account. What's up with the run of bad luck we're having? The last block was a 6.7x difficulty and a few blocks back there was an over 4x difficulty. Since the difficulty change the pool has averaged 1.6x difficulty. Bring on the counterbalancing good luck please! The same way bitcoins are. Press the withdraw button on the user page. Too late for you now, but for the future if you want to avoid screen scraping there's now a user stats JSON api:Code:http://mmpool.bitparking.com/userstats/usernameReplace 'username' with the username and you get a JSON result of hash rate and balances. Good point, that would be annoying. Best to wait till I have an interface set up allowing you to set and edit the alerts. At some point I plan to add support for notifying miners if their miner's stop mining. I'm open to suggestions on how best to handle the notification trigger. For my own server down notifications I'm using Pushover to send notifications to my phone. As a stopgap until I've implemented something for miners, if you'd like to receive pushover notifications if you're miner hash rate drops you can bitmessage me at BM-BbgTgGa6LX3yYqwJSwdwrzysvfWjM2u6 (or post here if you don't mind it being public, or PM me, or email the bitparking admin address) with your account name, your pushover user key and the hash rate minimum you want to receive a notification and I'll set a notification up for you. There were some server restarts today to try and track down the issue causing the stratum server crash that has been occurring on the mornings. Hopefully I've done the last of these just now to resolve the issue. I've looked into the failover issue and applied a fix just now. There was a short server restart as a result. I'll monitor the fix and see how it goes. The backup server does cache shares for a short time and this will always result in the website and stats being a number of shares behind. These are always submitted though. If you were to stop mining for a few minutes it'd catch up. Just in case though I've disabled the advertising of the backup server while I investigate to see if there are any issues. I installed some monitoring on the pool hash rate to ping my phone if it dropped low and it triggered this morning. I was able to see the reason for the recent crashes and have fixed the issue. Pool had about 5 minutes downtime. I'll continue to monitor. The getwork server is now randomly picking one of the stratum servers for the redirect header. If you want to connect to a specific server use the "stratum+tcp" address directly on your miner. I have a backup stratum server operating on stratum+tcp://stratum2.bitparking.com:3333. If the main stratum server fails this one should continue operating. It's not a complete failover as it still relies on some features on the main server but will work fine for the types of stratum crashes that occurred recently. You can also pick the stratum server that provides the best latency for your miner. I'll continue working on a solution that works in the case of the main server completely failing. Thanks, restarted pool. I should have the backup server up today - it's been syncing the blockchain and is nearly complete. I'm working on bringing up a second stratum server as a backup. You may see stats appearing on the main page and the JSON data for this second server while I test. I'll announce here when it's available. Yes it was OzCoin, and I think Coinotron used the same parameters when it was running DGM. Thanks for the information. Default difficulty on the stratum server has been changed from 8 to 16. You can adjust this higher or lower using "d=16" as your password, replacing "16" with the difficulty you want to mine at. Stratum server was crashing. I've restarted and will monitor it to track down the issue. I'm a bit confused about the term "fixed fee" vs average total fee" mentioned in the OP and what they mean. Is the "average total fee" the average fee the pool operator receives over the long term? Or is 'f' the fee the pool operator expects to receive over the long term?I ask because I notice, for example, a pool that states it has a 1% DGM fee but parameters "f=-0.25, c=0.2, o=0.8". This makes the "average total fee" 0 which makes me think that that isn't the fee the pool is expecting to get on average.
Is there interest in automatic payouts? I'm thinking of something like doing an automatic payment of all accounts over 1 BTC or similar every hour. Or do people prefer accumulating balances and withdrawing when needed? Updates on the exchange are posted at http://exchange.bitparking.com or you can bitmessage BM-BbgTgGa6LX3yYqwJSwdwrzysvfWjM2u6. Addresses can't be changed, sorry. The pool was designed this way to prevent hackers changing the address, or attempting to social engineer changing/adding an address by convincing me to do it. If you want to use a different address, create a new account with the new address. Oh cool, that's great! Let me know if you need anything else. I've just added one:Code:http://mmpool.bitparking.com/userstats/usernameGives JSON line:Code:{    "hashrate": 100,    "balances": [        {            "coin": "bitcoin",            "balance": 0.0695632        },        {            "coin": "devcoin",            "balance": 237.53994151        },        {            "coin": "i0coin",            "balance": 0        },        {            "coin": "ixcoin",            "balance": 0.46077017        },        {            "coin": "namecoin",            "balance": 0.00431738        }    ]} Minor pool update: Minimum withdrawal amount has changed from 0.1 btc to 0.05 btc. bitparking does merge mining on getwork and stratum of namecoin, devcoin, and ixcoin.Merge mining is a bit of a pain on the pool side. The alt coin daemons are behind a few versions compared to bitcoin, are less stable, and due to the increased overheard in communicating with them it can cause a small increase in bitcoin block orphans. Selling the coins requires going to various small exchanges and dealing with low volume. This is probably a headache a lot of pools don't want to deal with.Miners can look at the coinbase of the pool blocks and see if there is merge mining data in there. What miner are you using? Is it stratum or getwork? It'd have to be ixcoins trading for coiledcoins or something equally dead! No, it does not share the tx fees. The process of doing this is tricky for PPS pools that pay out before the block is found.  I'm a bit of a programming language nut. The pool was originally written because I wanted to try out the language runtimes and see how well they worked. I used to do what Eligius does too, back when 'mmpool' wasn't merge mining but was a namecoin pool. When I switched to merge mining I had to somehow associate multiple addresses with a user. When I did the ppcoin pool I used the same pool code after I'd done the user modification thinking that sometime in the future I'd enable merge mining with ppcoin as the primary chain but I couldn't get that working. The pool reserves of ixcoin have dropped too low and I can't top it up until and exchange that offers ixcoin goes back online. The pool is still generating ixcoin so eventually it'll get high enough to process payments again, or I'll fund it when Vircurex is back. It is my own front end and back end. The back end is written in the ATS programming language and the front end in the Ur/Web programming language. Thanks for the payment point I'll take a look.  You might want to note this sudden urgent terracoin update: http://terracoin.org/news/It switches on in 400 blocks or so which will come very fast. There's a reason why there are so few good exchanges around. It is hard. Running an exchange over cjdns, tor or i2p would help mitigate a DDOS attack I think. Have a public facing normal internet site that just proxies to the alt-network site. This would be a little slower (although it's pretty good on cjdns). If the public network site get's DDOS'd bring up another since it's quick to do a proxy - and users can use the alt-network site if they really need to trade.Downsides are people don't trust sites on alt-networks but that's mainly anonymous people setting up exchanges that are untrusted I think. Other downsides are it limits users if it's only accessible via the alt network.  I'll keep the exchange operating for a couple of extra days to give Vircurex a chance to get back up. Once I close the trading engine I'll keep it up for withdrawals for a while then process the emergency withdrawal address. After that I'll have some simple interface for withdrawals operating until the exchange is empty. Worse case people can email admin@bitparking.com if they can't reach the site and I'll sort it out. Exactly. It's gone from being able to cover something going wrong out of pocket to serious money that users financial stability depends on (from emails about the namecoin exchange I'm getting) very quickly. Were I to get into exchanges again I think it'd just be writing software and let someone else actually run/manage it. The software is the most interesting part for me anyway.  Do you have a link to this? If it's closed for a few days I'll keep my exchange open in the meantime until it reopens. I'd still recommend people not keep funds on the exchange though and transfer as needed. I had this too but only during the upgrade/reindex. When I stopped and restarted memory was back to normal. I don't know about the balance difference, that is odd. I didn't actually check when I upgraded, hope I didn't lose anything!
It is remaining open. With the exchanges closed I can concentrate on making the pool better. Yes, there was an address for both registered. For my users that don't have an emergency address I'll leave something up to enable them to withdraw their coins. I just did a run through of the PPC, TRC and LTC exchanges to make sure the hot wallets are topped up. Don't panic if the withdraw doesn't go through, the hot wallet may have dropped low and I'll top it up.  Thanks, I'm sorry they didn't work out  Recent events have shown that running an exchange is way to risky and stressful to me in the current alt coin climate. Prices have risen to a point where I'm not comfortable I can provide a reasonable level of service. To this end I'm closing the exchange and encourage all users to move to vircurex. The following details are on the exchange site: Recent events have shown that running an exchange is way to risky and stressful to me in the current alt coin climate.

The following details are on the exchange site: Even with the fee increase the pool has hit a large bad luck run and I've decided to close the pool. The risk is to large to end out of pocket and having to buy ppcoins to cover the reserve at high prices. The following is posted on the pool page: Make sure you've spelt your username correctly. It needs to have the correct case. What miner are you using? Due to orphans, stales and the instability of the ppcoin daemon there is a lot of loss that the pool absorbs. My PPC pool wasn't designed for huge hash rates like it is getting now and it's causing a large strain on the server. I've increased the fee to account for this and to discourage miners from using it - preferring them to use cheaper pools and reduce the load. When PPC supports getblocktemplate I can switch to using stratum instead of getwork and the pool can lower the fee. I do recommend switching to another pool if you're not satisfied.With the 500+ block confirmation required with PPCoin the pool requires a large buffer. The pool reserves keep dropping low and I'm funding out of pocket to keep things topped up. I was fine with this when prices were low and I didn't mind spending 'hobby money' levels to keep it going. Now the costs are much higher and the pool needs to pay for itself. Support for getblocktemplate and sendblock are the only blockers for my pool to have stratum on PPC. Currently at almost 500 Ghash/s on getwork is causing some strain with the setup I have unfortunately. That and the memory leak. I've set ppcoind to be restarted every two hours to stop crashes due to that. PPS pools are slightly more risky for the operator than PPLNS. Without a fee, or even a low fee, the risk of bankruptcy is insanely high - I don't know how the Mt Red's of the world do it. I don't know how you do it either with PPLNS - I assume you get enough donations to make it viable? People mine in pools for different reasons and I'm sure most anyone has backup pools set anyway so I'm all for people picking and choosing their pools however they want. If you don't like a pools fees, payout method, or presentation, mine somewhere else or even solo. That's the nice thing about bitcoin. So much choice. Good point. There are patches around to that stops dust transactions from being used in coin selection. Same issue existed in my exchange, it's crazy. Some people do many small deposits direct from mining pools for less than 0.0001 coins and it fragments the wallet resulting in high fees for withdrawals which the exchange has to eat. It'd be nice if the various coins had an API that worked like:Code:foocoind sendtoaddress 1X9999 25 0.01Where 0.01 is the fee you want to pay. If that fee is too small for the coind's default it can fail and return the actual fee required. You can then retry the command with the new fee. This would allow finding out the fee to pass on to the user. Click on "PPC/BTC" in the order summary on the right, below "Your balances". Yes, the machine that was hosting the exchange is not operational so I moved the ip to my pool server to put a message up. I am transferring a disk image of the exchange at the moment and will start recovery when it completes. Yes, working on it now. Restarting a crashed bitcoind, should be up in 5 minutes or so.Edit: Pool is operational again. The server crashed this morning, and I was unable to remotely bring it back online. Currently working with my service provider to get it back in operation.  Merge mining is temporarily disabled while I investigate crashes with the merge mining daemons.Edit: Merge mining reenabled. I posted the data here in another thread but thought it might be relevant here. There's a good analysis of the reserves needed for a PPS pool in Meni Rosenfeld's paper on pool payout schemes. Using that formula, at 25BTC per block and 2% fee, allowing for a 1 in 1000 chance of going bankrupt, the pool needs a reserve of 4,300 BTC. If the pool tries to get by with a reserve of 1,000 BTC then it has a 20% chance of going bankrupt. Variance is a killer. There was a website that plotted pool balance variance over time based on fee but I can't locate it at the moment.Back when the price of bitcoin was $1 or less it was fun running a pool since $4,300 in reserves wasn't too much of a risk. Now it's close to $400,000 so it's less of the 'fun' level. Less risk if you don't go for PPS of course. There's a good analysis of the reserves needed for a PPS pool in Meni Rosenfeld's paper on pool payout schemes. Using that formula, at 25BTC per block and 2% fee, allowing for a 1 in 1000 chance of going bankrupt, the pool needs a reserve of 4,300 BTC. If the pool tries to get by with a reserve of 1,000 BTC then it has a 20% chance of going bankrupt. Variance is a killer. There was a website that plotted pool balance variance over time based on fee but I can't locate it at the moment.
Slush's pool doesn't do PPS so there's less risk. They pay out a proportion of that produced by the block based on the shares you've found (using a formula to reduce hopping). PPS pays out for every share submitted. So in periods of bad luck the pool pays out and hopes to catch up on the periods of good luck. Profit margins are so small on pools that 'paying out of profits' isn't much of an option during the bad periods. A 2% fee is only 0.5 btc per block. So to cover for one block's worth of bad luck, or one single orphan, will take 50 blocks for the pool operator to recover from in fees. Bitparking terracoin exchange is upgraded. Exchange is down while I do the mandatory terracoin version upgrade.Edit: Exchange upgraded and operating again. .What exactly does the difficulty change do and why? They haven't given much time for people to update given that it's a forking change. It's likely to cause problems with pools and exchanges with users on old clients wondering why they're not getting any of their coins confirmed. Nice. CoiledCoin is the only one, of the coins that got a lot of attention, missing that I noticed. It should ideally be: Miner->Stratum server->Litecoind directly and bypass pushpool entirelyBut you could put the proxy between the miner and the stratum server if they're using a miner that only does getwork. You'll likely have to write code for the stratum server to update your pools backend database with share information,etc (I haven't looked at the python server code).If your Java is better that your Python you might find fireduck's SockThing easier to get going. How about have the user have to send a token devcoin amount to an address. When that is received the account is activated. This is similar to how the bitcoin wiki works. That is correct. When you use stratum the long poll system is not used. All  notifications about new blocks are handle by the stratum protocol. Yes it does. The recent increase in difficulty on ixcoin and devcoin (and hashrates which can be seen on vircurex.com) is due to the activation of merge mining on my stratum server. Unfortunately one of the back end bitcoind's crashed last night and was refusing connections. I'm investigating why this happened and how to work around it if it happens again. What's the best hash someone found on this payout method, do you know? Pool is down due to a server issue. I expect it to be up in about 10 minutes.EDIT: Pool is back up. I've reset the bitcoin server wallet. This means there are currently no funds in it until a couple of blocks have gone by when the transaction to top it up again goes through. I'll notify here when the funds are back in it.EDIT2: Pool funds are transferred and withdrawals should be working. Thanks, fixed. Has anyone played with the OP_EVAL capability of CoiledCoin? This was the alternative to bitcoin's P2SH back when it was first discussed. CoiledCoin went and made every address use this which was supposed to result in some nice capabilities. I was curious if anyone would pick that up and run with it.  The source I have has a 'qt' directory and it doesn't look like multicoin - it looks like it's based on the original bitcoin source. I'll investigate, thanks for the report. I've activated merge mining on the bitparking pool stratum servers now so you may notice an increase in hash rate and difficulty on Devcoin. Oops, found a bug. The bug affects total pool statistics, not user statistics. I've fixed the cause and am now in the process of correcting pool stats. Sorry for the restarts.Edit: Pool stats fixed. And we found a stratum bitcoin block which is a good sign that I didn't break bitcoin block generation when adding merged mining to stratum. Merge mining is enabled on stratum now so we should start seeing the hash rate of the alt coins increasing. I'll be monitoring closely the next couple of days to make sure I haven't broken anything, in particular the generation of bitcoin blocks! Pool will have 5 minutes of downtime to install merge mining updates.Edit: Upgrade done. Let's see if it sticks...
More stratum merge mining progress. I've got the code working and blocks are found on the alt chains in my testnet. I'll do some more testing over the next few hours than push to production. Not long now!  I'm making progress on the merge mining support on the stratum connection. I hope to have it testing tomorrow and all going well put it live the next day. The hash rate of the pool has increased dramatically since putting in stratum support. Currently it's around 800 GH/s. It'll be good to get that hash rate working on the alt chains with merge mining. And good for the pool reserves as they're paying the alt coins out of the pool pockets at the moment. It's mining proof of stake blocks. I don't know of a way to turn it off. Bitparking merge mining has resumed. Bitparking merge mining has resumed. Pool is going down for a couple of minutes to re-enable merge mining on the getwork server.Edit: Back up and merge minining on the getwork server. IIRC, having this happen early was part of the experiment to see what would result. BTW, bitparking has temporarily stopped merge mining ixcoin to fix issues with merge mining and version 1/2 blocks. I hope to resume in a couple of days but in the meantime hashrate of ixcoin and transaction speeds is likely to be low unless someone else joins in. Bitparking merge mining pool has temporarily stopped merge mining due to a issue with version 1 and version 2 blocks. I hope to fix this in the next 24-36 hours but in the meantime it will mean slow devcoin transaction confirmations times unless someone picks up the mining slack. It's because of they way they appear to the devcoind client. They appear as "generated" rather than the normal sent/received status. The balance of the generated coins aren't picked up via the devcoin API calls usually used to see if funds have been received. Merge mining is temporarily disabled. The merge mining code was putting the wrong height data in the coinbase for my version 2 blocks. This didn't use to be checked but once we hit 75% of the network producing version 2 blocks it activated. This resulted in my last 3 blocks being invalidated. I had discovered the version mismatch earlier today but thought version 2 blocks weren't activate until 95% so had some time to fix. That's what I've been working on today. Unfortunately I didn't know about the 75% switch and I ran out of time.So merge mining is deactivated until I finish coding and testing the fix. I expect about 24-36 hours. It looks like we aren't - I ran a quick shell script on bitcoind. But due to a merge mining issue my coinbase has an invalid height and the check for that gets activated at 75% which we've hit. Lost three blocks, argh! No worries. I'd been using it to track the supermajority and working today on getting my merge mining server compatible with version 2 blocks. Then I noticed the error in my logs and which makes me think we've hit it and I've run out of time. Note their current block number showing in their list. It's over 1,000 blocks out of date. Have we hit this already? I'm seeing in the logs of a v1 node:Code:ERROR: AcceptBlock() : block height mismatch in coinbase I just noticed that my merge mining getwork server was producing version 2 blocks without having a block height in the coinbase in certain circumstances. If you're a miner using a merge mining patch you might want to check that your coinbase is correct otherwise when the supermajority happens your blocks will be orphaned if the coinbase is wrong. This is me. It's a wallet I created by sending approximately 250-500 PPC every 5-10 minutes over the period of a month. The actual amount and time depended on how much PPC I had available. I kept this running on a 24x7 node and it averaged about 150 blocks immature constantly after about 40 days. The machine it was on had a hard drive failure and it's been offline for a week or so. Having recovered the wallet from backup I've fired it up again and I guess it's catching up. For the curious the ppcoind node this runs on uses about 80% CPU idling - I assume that POS stack code takes a bit of CPU while cycling through so many transactions. The upgrade hasn't happened yet. About 14 hours to go. What is the exact switch over time? There will  be a couple of brief periods of downtime while I update to bitcoind 0.8.1 for the blockchain fork fixes. The stratum server should be down for a short period of about 60 seconds since it's already running a modified 0.8.0. The getwork server will be down for longer while it updates - the stratum server will work during this time.Edit: Stratum server is upgraded to 0.8.1 and back up. The getwork server will be going down once the stratum server has stabalized.Edit2: Getwork server is upgraded and back up. I've changed the default difficulty on the stratum server to 8. If this is too much for your miner don't forget you can change it as described in the original post here by setting your password to "d=x" where 'x' is the number of the difficulty. 
0.3 doesn't switch on until after March 20 I think. What version of the proxy software? I just tried the git repository and it is working. Can you PM me some of the trackback (or a link to a pastebin with it) so I can see what's causing the error? That looks fine. Is this slush's proxy? I'll download it and see if I can reproduce the issue. Great to hear it's working well for you! Yes, it'll just take some time to update my current merge mining code to provide the information the stratum server needs. There's nothing fundamental with stratum that would prevent it from working. I'm hoping to get it done in the next few days. Stratum server finds its first block. Block 226272. This is now fixed. Thanks for reporting it. Will a verison of ppcoin with getblocktemplate/submitblock support be coming out any time? What BTC price do you use to compute market cap? Do you take the depth of the order book into account? Otherwise it would seem to me to be prone to manipulation by people inching small orders up to increase apparent market cap and profitability. Oops typo, well spotted. I'll fix it, thanks. Usually pools provide shares to a miner set to difficulty '1'. This controls how fast you submit solutions to the pool. '1' was good for slower miners but with fast GPUs, FPGA's and ASICS it results in so much data being sent to the pool that your miner spends all its time sending and less time solving. By increasing the difficulty level you send less data and spend more time mining. It increases your variance a bit so you don't want to set it too high. For your setup the default of '4' should be fine. This works for me with cgminer 2.11.0:Code:./cgminer -o stratum+tcp://mmpool.bitparking.com:3333 -u username -p d=16Does it work for you? Is port 3333 blocked at your firewall? Can you connect to any other stratum server? It's working for me. Anyone else having issues? Use the "-datadir" command line option:Code:namecoind -datadir=/foo/bar/baz/somewhereMake sure the wallet,dat and namecoin.conf are in that directory. If that directory is located  on an encrypted drive it'll be encrypted. Any command you run though can access it since it's unencyrpted while you're logged on. But at least if your machine gets stolen it is safe assuming the encryption is solid. They might be doing what I'm doing. My 0.8.0 stratum server node is connected behind a 0.7.2 node so if it sends a bad block the 0.7.2 node will stop it before propagating it to the network. My stratum server is at the defaults though since I'd rather not orphan a block and halt my 0.7.2 getwork node. The main pool page now shows the Getwork, Stratum and total hash rates. So far there is 50 GHash on the stratum server. I've also adjusted these rates to show GHash instead of the previous MHash. The URL http://mmpool.bitparking.com/stats2 shows this data in JSON format. Bitparking is currently using all the default settings from the 0.7.2 client. I've shown before that I can generate large consecutive chains of blocks by just bring the exchange cold wallet online. The first time I did this I got 84 consecutive blocks. The second time over 100. Yesterday I brought another wallet online and left it running. When I closed it overnight it had 400 blocks in 'immature' status. That is probably why POS difficulty is currently 30+. The exchange doesn't have that many coins. There are people out there with more coins than the exchange I'm sure. The restart mentioned in my previous message is done. There shouldn't be any more planned restarts until the next round of stratum modifications for merge mining support. There was a stratum restart a few minutes ago to improve performance on share submission. There will be another one in an hour to change over to another bitcoind. This should only be a 30 second outage. Thanks it's back. Sure would be nice if the ppcoin memory leak could be fixed...
Stratum support seems to be going OK. I've had to do a few server restarts to real with merge mining issues on the getwork server but other than that things are working fine. Some better luck would be nice! I have some more tweaks to do on the stratum side of things to make reporting shares more efficient and hope to get that done over the next couple of days. It should also take into account the number of coins generated in a block. For coins like ppcoin this changes on every block. A description of stratum is here. It basically provides a more efficient way of receiving and sending work from/to the pool that the 'getwork' and longpoll protocols. For ASIC miners and other very fast devices this will cut down on bandwidth and make more efficient use of their machines. There should be less stales.   I am testing stratum support. You may see your miner jump to the stratum protocol if it supports the redirection via the X-Stratum header. The server is stratum+tcp://mmpool.bitparking.com:3333. The stratum server is not currently merge mining but it is paying out the alt coin PPS portion from pool reserves. Please post any issues about the stratum usage here. Remember to set your difficulty for mining by setting your password to "d=8" to set the difficulty to '8'. Change '8' to an integer number for the difficulty you want to mine at. If you don't set the difficulty it will default to 4 on the stratum server. Withdrawals on bitparking pool are re-enabled and service is back to normal for the exchanges. bitparking is running 0.7 nodes. You can still downgrade if you haven't deleted your old blockchain data. If you're not mining though you should probably just shut the node down until the situation is resolved and we know which is the 'one true client' to run. If you're mining solo, mine on a 0.7.2 client. Bitparking is now running 0.7.2. I've rolled back to an older bitcoin client as suggested by the bitcoin developers and have enabled mining again. Withdrawals are disabled until the issue with the bitcoin blockchain is resolved. It looks like a wider problem with blockchain forks. All bitparking services are down while this bitcoin issue is investigated. Pool is down while I investigate an issue with bitcoind not receiving new blocks on the network for the past few hours. Yes. http://ppcpool.bitparking.com. The exchange is back up now. Exchanges are back up now. PPC pool is up. PPC exchange is down for bitcoind and ppcoind upgrades. Both of which require re-processing the blockchain. The exchange is down for the bitcoind upgrade to 0.8.0 and the ppcoind upgrade to 0.3.0. All the bitparking exchanges are down for a bitcoind upgrade to 0.8.0. This is taking a few hours to redo the blockchain. It should be up in an hour or so based on progress so far. I'm sorry but it's not possible to change withdrawal addresses on the pool. As it states on the registration page: "These addresses cannot be changed once you've accepted the form below. You'll need to register a new userid if you want to change them."How did you come to no longer owning the existing one? Can you contact the current owner to retrieve the funds? Do you own the private key for the address, and if you do, can you sign a message I give you with it (to recover funds)? Fees are one benefit. Unfortunately the variance of mining is so extreme that you won't see this benefit for a long time, and in the meantime you'll see such large swings that you'll be wanting a large buffer of your own personal coins to cover it. Thanks to the rising price of bitcoins you can be tens of thousands of dollars down if the short term luck is bad. Or tens of thousands of dollars up if the luck is good of course. And this also depends a lot on the pool payout method. Imagine being 1,000 bitcoins down due to variance, paying PPS, and bitcoins being $50 USD each. Ouch. Devcoin I can understand. Buying devcoin is essentially a donation to open source developers who receive grants from devcoin. By buying them you increase the exchange rate which enables those developers to get a better price when selling them. I have no idea why ixcoin's are bought. Maybe someone has secret plans for them. This was due to bitparking temporarily disabling merge mining to track down an issue with a bitcoind upgrade. It has been re-enabled. The difficulty of ixcoin and devcoin are so high they hardly moved from the approximately 36 hour outage so a 51% attack occurring during that time would have required a significant hash rate.It was interesting to see that Devcoin still chugged along, although slowly, but ixcoin ground to a complete halt. It looks like almost no one other than bitparking is mining ixcoin.
Merge mining is operational again. I'll document them later today when I'm not mobile. I put the block size at 500kb when I first read your post btw. I briefly tried 1000kb but the load on the pool was a bit much. At least it highlighted some inefficiencies I need to fix! Merge mining is temporarily disabled. Payment is still made for the alt coins from pool reserves. I'll post here when it's re-enabled.EDIT: I expect it to be a 24-48 hours from now to re-enable.EDIT2: Merge mining is re-enabled. I don't think it matters for people to take them as payment. Developers/open source people receive their devcoin grant and trade it for BTC or dollars on an exchange. People wishing to support the grants can buy devcoins on the exchange as a way of keeping the value high enough for the grantees to get a good rate. So one could look at buying devcoins on the exchange as a way of supporting deveopment in the fields that devcoin gives grants to. The blockchain.info link says its had 52 confirmations. Are you sure your blockchain is up to date? That links says it's had 52 confirmations. Are you sure your blockchain is up to date? Pool down for 5 minute maintenance.Edit: Pool is back up. The pool's bitcoin wallet has been defragmented. Some of this has changed, for example ECC is now used. The initial key exchange is still there unfortunately. There are no miners. A proof of work is done by the sender when a message is sent.  IRC discussion going on in EFNet in #bitmessage if anyone's interested. There's also a reddit /r/bitmessage. It'd be nice to do that but my understanding is that a 0.01 limit causes quite a bit of wallet fragmentation. Once recipients of those 0.01 withdrawals try to do a spend with a number of them as inputs they'll end up paying larger fees. Even with checkpointing it would be interesting. The blocks came very fast. If the target got 6 block notifications before a checkpoint had time to go out and be received it could have been double spent. I fired up bitparkings ppcoin exchange cold storage wallet to top up the exchange hot wallet and immediately found 85 POS blocks consecutively in a few minutes. Wow. It's definitely been polarizing. Many people love using OpenID and just as many people have hated the exchanges use of it. Instead of using aux chains you could use a DHT (Distributed Hash Table).  How new is the terracoind you are using? See this bitcoin issue. It appears newer bitcoin versions may not support this. I don't think people are waiting for the update before rolling out services. They're not rolling out services because there's no real interest to do so. It's a problem every alt-coin faces. Even Bitcoin took more than a year before services started happening.  Exchange is back up now.  Solidcoin removed the copyright notice of the original Bitcoin devleopers and changed the license. That was the objection from LukeJr IIRC. I force SSL for everything on the exchange to prevent user credentials from leaking if the user visits an http version of a resource.
The exchange requires SNI support for SSL so possible something was stripping it out. What version of Firefox are you using? I'm not getting this error and the certificate I'm served is the ppcexchange one.  It won't ask you to go through the sign in process unless you are clicking "Sign Up" again. Make sure you put in your user id in the box next to the "Log In" button and click that. Your user id is the one you selected when signing up initially.  At the bottom of the cryptostocks website it says:That's why I asked. The page for Vircurex didn't mention any relationship with cryptostocks which, if there was a relationship, might impact on interest in it. The rucoin website has a source archive on the download page. It shows it as  https://www.rucoin.org/rucoin-0.401.tar.gz. According to the website, source is here. I haven't tried it but the source does include scrypt stuff so I'm assuming it's a recent version. Can anyone confirm? Is Cryptostocks owned by Vircurex?  Bitparking disputes your selection of dominant exchange there... Pool is back online. Pool is back online. Yeah, I posted in the pool thread that's it's down for maintenance. It'll be up soon. Pool is down for some maintenance. Pool is down for some maintenance. Ease of implementation. The exchange is based on existing code for other alt currency exchanges which don't have the same addresses formats. It's a good idea for a future update though, I hadn't considered that now that there is private key import/export features in the RPC API. Right, that's the approach I've been suggesting. I think it should work. Thanks, back up. The problem with using the filename/title as the namecoin key is people will squat them, or set them to fake values.  Yeah, command line tool/gui would be good. A website with a read only view would be good for initial uptake though for those not wanting to install namecoin just to see what it's all about. As I test I found a long magnet link from a movie site. I took just the hash from that link (the string of hex digits after '?xt=urn:btih:') and searched for that in the DHT network via btdigg.org. This pulled up the correct file information, including a shorter magnet link (without the 'tr' tracker links). This seems to imply that just requiring the hash is fine. I did the same for searching for the archlinux iso (hash e940a7a57294e4c98f62514b32611e38181b6cae) and it came up.This does seem to indicate however that namecoin isn't needed for storing information since the DHT already has it. Maybe the namecoin provides the "unique identity that can be followed to provide files I'm interested in" aspect. Can you give an example of a long link? Here's an example of the archlinux distro:Code:magnet:?xt=urn:btih:e940a7a57294e4c98f62514b32611e38181b6cae&dn=archlinux-2013.01.04-dual.iso&tr=udp://tracker.archlinux.org:6969&tr=http://tracker.archlinux.org:6969/announceThis is 176 characters. Are the "tr" keys actually needed?Edit: The only mandatory parameter= required is the 'xt' according to BEP 009. So magnet links can be quite short. A website can scan namecoin for the magnet links then retrieve the metadata via the Bittorrent DHT. I still think it might be good to include metadata in namecoind though to make searching faster/easier. Something like:Code:{"hash":"btih:e940a7a57294e4c98f62514b32611e38181b6cae","description":"archlinux-2013.01.04 iso","tags":["linux","iso"]}
I've created a "btm/testing" name for testing. It should show in about block 93985 where you can see it the magnet links it has posted with:Code:namecoind name_history btm/testingYou can list the "btm/" namespace with:Code:namecoind name_filter "^btm/.+"Now there needs to be a website that scans that namespace, does a name history on the names, and provides it in a pretty format. Good point about 'sendtoname'. Using a separate protocol per namespace is also a good idea. Given magnet url's have a "dn" key for giving the full name I'm wondering if it's even worth having JSON as the value. Just having the magnet link gives all that's needed. I posted my ideas here for storing torrent information in namecoin if you're interested. Namecoin doesn't really have the notion of .something. That mapping is done via other software. Namecoin just provides a way to map a name to a value stored in the blockchain. By convention names prefixed with "d/" are mapped to domain names in the real world with .bit as the TLD by various pieces of software. There's nothing to stop you from using namecoin to purchase domains with different prefixes and there are already examples of such in the blockchain.If you wanted to immediately devalue all the squatters names you could come up with some DNS software that maps a different namecoin prefix. If your DNS translation software gets popular then that would become the defacto "namecoin domain name" system. I agree that namecoin would be a good start for experimenting with this. There's a number of approaches that could be taken. Some ideas:The namecoin 'key' is a torrent name with the value being the magnet link. This is simple but has a few disadvantages. The owner of the key has to update it every 36,000 blocks for it to remain alive. Only that owner can modify the magnet link if it changes. Multiple people will store information for the same file with slightly different key names. Spammers can create fake magnet links easily for popular filenames, or squat on filenames (eg. future episodes of tv shows or movies about to be released).The key is a username of a person publishing links. The value is a datastructure (JSON?) that holds the link type (magnet, mega, freenet, http, etc), the URN (magnet link, freenet address, etc), a title, tags and maybe other things. A user can then filter by the namecoin key if they find a user that publishes torrents they like. Spammers would need to register their own username and people will learn which are bad and ignore them. Adding links is done via a name_update command. You can get a list of all links for a user by doing a "name_history" on their username. This can sit under a namecoin prefix like "fileshare/". I registered a fileshare name to show an example. Downsides are that a name_update can only have one pending for a given key per block. This could help cut down on spam updates though. Another downside is that it requires a name_history to get all entries and isn't as simple or efficient as iterating over a namecoin prefix to get all keys.As an example of the second option, running this namecoind command will show an example entry:Code:namecoind name_filter "^fileshare/.+"That example adds a "command" entry which I though could be used to add/delete/modify items but I'm not sure of the utility. It also might be worth encrypting or obfuscating the entries. Maybe an option to add an address to the value for users to send namecoins to as a means of voting. Yes, it's an additional value specified in the JSON value when registering the name. Namecoin is really a name/value datastore, with a portion of it used for domain names. Devcoin adjusts on every block IIRC and doesn't have checkpointing. Have you take a look how they do it? That's by design. It means it's impossible for a hacker to change your bitcoin payout address. Allowing changes would also require users to have passwords which adds another whole level of security that's uneeded in the current design. Just create a new username if you want to change things. There are other pools mining PPC. That list only shows local to coinotron. PPC is also complicated by the POS blocks making difficulty matching more complicated. I only know of two:* http://exchange.zapto.org* https://trcexchange.bitparking.com Would a tor/i2p service that connects to an existing exchange suffice? Or would you want an "all darknet" exchange? The problem with the latter is it'd be hard to get traffic to make for a decent orderbook. What's wrong with the existing exchanges? Or are you specifically looking for a tor/i2p based service? This is mainly because I first implemented a namecoin exchange back when it was the first alt-coin. When the others started coming out I just modified that exchange - the changes to add multiple currencies to it would be more extensive and not something I was keen on doing at the time. At some point I may rewrite things to make multiple currencies easier but at the moment there's too many other projects going on. Right, it was the easiest way of showing total exchange volume for various price points. I restricted my pool to a small number of connections for a couple of weeks and it made no noticeable difference to the memory consumption so I think (2) is out. Are you keeping a cache of blocks or anything like that when a block is found via getwork? The column on the right is a cumulative sum. It shows the total of all TRC up to the given price (ie. all rows above it). You can use an anonymous open id provider or host your own if that's an issue. But that aside, that's fine, I understand your point of view. I prefer not handling passwords on the exchange. See my message here for details on the closing of the exchange: Exchange is back online. Exchange is back online.
Yep, it'll be processed when it comes back online. The exchange will be going down for maintenance for 30 minuts within the next hour or so. The exchange will be going down for maintenance for approximately 30 minutes within the next hour or so. I thought Coblee was the original developer of Litecoin. It looks to me like the memory leak in ppcoind is related to the number of blocks created/mined. My pool now has a low number of blocks produced, due to lower hash rate and the larger number of proof of stake blocks produced by others. This has resulted in needing to restart the daemon less often to reclaim memory.I wonder if proof of stake miners are seeing a memory leak. Is anyone running a node 24x7 for proof of stake producing a reasonable number of blocks per day seeing this? There are 15 million PPC in existence. Get 10% of them selling their coins and the market will drop low. Especially considering that there aren't many buyers. There were a lot of buyers at the beginning probably because people were speculating that PPC would become useful. As time goes on and there becomes no way of using them anywhere the number of buyers drop, more people start selling them since there's nothing you can do with them but sell them, and the price drops further. As others have noted this is the story of most other alt coins. Just to be clear so I know what you're talking about, and to remove 'reading comprehension' error, can you please post a patch with the change you are suggesting? They can't, because doing so would make all blocks after the block where the new difficulty comes into effect invalid. Correct me if I'm wrong but If someone modifies the fork to generate a block without any foundation percentage then the existing forked clients will accept this and the original freicoin clients won't. This would result in a hard fork of the blockchain and isolate the forked clients from the existing network.  If you do I expect that none of your blocks will be accepted by the FreiCoin network. Have a look in main.cpp for 'GetInitialDistributionBudget'. This shows the addresses that receive the Foundation percentage. Not really. Namecoin only has 1/3rd of the bitcoin network hash rate merge mining it. None of the other merge mineable coins (ixcoin, i0coin, devcoin, etc) has any large pool merge mining it. Some of the big pools are grumbling about including namecoin and I wouldn't be surprised to see it dropped at some point. Just because it can be merge mined doesn't mean any pools will actually bother.Unfortunately merge mining is a double edged sword. Namecoin showed it can be used to protect a coin. Coiledcoin showed that it can be used to attack one. It also seems to make the coin mostly worthless as people see it as a by product of bitcoin mining. I haven't seen any merge mineable coin gain much in the way of usage outside of "sell immediately" as a result. Those are the times when it's more profitable to mine PPC and sell them to earn BTC than it is to mine BTC directly. Chain hoppers join in. There's still this race though, unless I'm misunderstanding things:That is the exchange has calculated the balance of the user for the withdrawal based on current blockheight and the user clicks "Go". The freicoind rpc transaction is crafted just after the blockheight changes in the second between "Go" and the RPC call. Now the value of the coins withdrawn in the transaction is higher than the amount computed internally by the exchange. This is a small window of time, and small amounts, but in a long running exchange it'll happen.I guess the exchange can avoid this by crafting the raw withdraw transaction itself, embedding the reference height it used for the demurrage calculatoin into it, and using the "sendraw" commands. That's a bit more work for the exchange however. Is there an issue with race conditions between a site and the blockchain for sites that hold balances like exchanges? Say a user of the exchange withdraws their balance of 1,000 FRC which the exchange has calculated as the amount at "present value". During the time of processing the withdraw the block height changes due to blocks being found. Now that 1,000 being sent is backed on the exchange by 999.998 (or 1,000 less demurrage). It'll go through because there are other user funds in the exchange wallet. But over time the exchange loses out.If a withdrawal takes a few blocks to go through due to high transaction volume on the blockchain or malicious miners holding back exchange blocks will this results in a bigger difference between what the exchange expected and what actually happened?The exchange could detect the transaction when it completes, find out the real value and adjust the users balance but then an exchange account can be in debt and the user can just leave and create a new account. Doesn't this have the issue that sell orders can exist without coins backing it? If a user lists 1,000 FRC for sale which is their exact balance on the exchange then on the next block they no longer have 1,000 coins to match the order. What's the best approach for services that hold user balances to account for the reduction in value of the users account over time? Exchanges and pools tend to have large balances held for users and will not want to foot the cost of the balance reduction.Is there an API to get this? Does the "accounts" system that bitcoin have work for freicoin and include the reduction in value in the users account balances? I prefer not using the "accounts" system so I'm hoping it's not the only way. This is the same with PPCcoin. Each block has a different reward value. One way of solving this is to use "getmemorypool". This returns the reward of the block currently being worked on. The pool then provides PPS based on that. Other coins have done similar as well. Solidcoin had a "coin protection fund" IIRC was used to fund projects and help raise funds to protect the chain. Devcoin has a large percentage of blocks go to "open source developers". The distribution of that is controlled by a group of people which would be similar to the foundation you suggest I imagine. Solidcoin wasn't successful but Devcoin seems to be doing ok with this approach. Is there any usage of Freicoin at the moment? Many alt coins start off with speculation (and unfortunately stay there) but with Freicoin losing value over time does this mean current speculators are hoping something will happen real soon or there coins will disappear? Or am I misunderstanding how Freicoin works? The churn on a pools wallet due to withdrawals results in getting a 30 day coin age to be uncommon. The current ppcoin client doesn't take coin age into account when computing inputs for sends.
It's the proof of stake transactions. Your coins are old enough and you've generated proof of stake blocks. These reduce your balance for 520 confirmations and then come back with a little bit extra for your troubles.If you use the command line build and do a "getinfo" you'll see the amount currently set aside for POS blocks as "stake". PPC should be considered a test currency. As I say on my exchange:Even if the developers released it as a '1 year testnet' coin I'm sure you'd find speculators jumping on it. And probably even continuing with it after the year. Much like when Solidcoin 1 shut down some people kept it going. One a coin is out in the wild, it's a real coin. One way of preventing this for a true '1 year testnet approach' might be to reset the blockchain reguarly. Hard to do on a chain that requires coin age though. The regular chain resets on bitcoin's testnet seem to stop it being used as a currency pretty effectively. There's an API to find out the current checkpointed block so at some point I'll change to using that so the number of confirmations varies based on that. I'm aware that without checkpointing the number of confirmations don't matter if someone has a large ability to mine blocks. I've increased the current number of confirmations to allow for time for the checkpoint's to be broadcast. In light of the recent ppcoin disclosure I've increased the required deposit confirmations for ppcoins from six to ten. Good catch. So POS is just another POW that users can speed up as much as they have CPU power available (and coins meeting the criteria)? What client are you using? Try deleting the block chain (not your wallet.dat!) and redownoading it. All i0coin balances have now been sent. i0coin balances are in the process of being sent out now. You should see your coins appear in the next few hours depending on network speed. i0coin balances on mmpool.bitparking.com are in the process of being sent out now. You should see your coins appear in the next few hours depending on network speed. Leave it running for a while. It takes over 1GB on my servers. Yes. I think it's the most different alt coin that's come out since namecoin. It doesn't appear to be getting much use outside of speculation though. The theory is people holding lots of coins would want the coin to be secure. By participating in proof of stake they secure the network in proportion to the number of coins they hold. They're not being rewarded for being early adopters. They're being rewarded for protecting the network. The actual reward is minimal though. Nothing like proof of work block rewards. They'll be sent out before the end of the month. This is correct. TRC (and PPCoin) can't be merge mined as a secondary chain. This means you can't mine bitcoins along with them. You could (with patches) mine them as the primary chain and mine other alt chains at the same time - just not bitcoin. I'm pretty sure tomaszsz is referring to the main page of Cointron which adds up Litecoins Mh/s rate as Gh/s in the total. For example (made up numbers because the site is down):Code:Bitcoin 50Gh/sPPCoin 30Gh/sLitecoin 50Mh/sTotal 130Gh/sThe total shouldn't be 130Gh/s but 80Gh/s plus 50Mh/s. It's probably just a error in the html page that nobody has noticed since no one really looks at the total hash rate there. the bitmessage domain seems to be down. The pool is currently down and I'm investigating why it's failing to restart. There was an issue yesterday when a miner with thousands of clients joined caused performance issues which may be related. The pool is down. I'm investigating why it's failing to restart and will update here when I have more information. There's been some server instability over the last few hours due to a large number of individual miners connecting. I've made some server adjustments and will be monitoring it.
I use the rpc getwork. Is it possible that it's not memory being lost but being maintained in a cache? Has ppcoin added any additional static global maps or caches? The main page of coinotron says 200 Mhash for LTC, but adds it up as Ghash. Is it mhash or ghash? Even 200 mhash strikes me as impressive for ltc. Pool was down for a bit due to ppcoind running out of memory. ppcoin restart in progress to workaround memory leak in ppcoind. There was a pool restart a few minutes ago to work around the ppcoind memory leak. Yes. It's most noticeable in alt-coins because people send large amounts around more often. I regularly have to combine transactions in the exchange and pool wallets to be able to process large withdrawals otherwise transaction creation fails. If memory and resource consumption is reduced it can be re-added. My guess would be the same issue that exists with normal transaction creation. If the wallet is fragmented due to lots of tiny transactions then transaction creation with lots of inputs will fail. Possibly this prevents stake generation. Pool is back up. i0coin mining is now disabled. The pool is no longer running the i0coin daemon. All existing user balances will be sent to their registered addresses over the next week. Oops, we're down. Coming back up shortly. The pool is merge mining the alt-coins again. There was a restart a few minutes ago to enable this. I wasn't offering opinion on any other discussion btw, just wanted to clarify that one statement since things sometimes get quoted and re-quoted. There was a restart a few minutes ago while I switched off merge mining temporarily. This means that no alt chains are currently being mined. You are however still being paid as normal for the alt chain shares out of pool reserves. This is a temporary situation (about 24-48 hours) while I monitor stales to see if its a particular alt chain causing issues. I'll slowly being them back one by one while monitoring the stales. I'm not aware of Luke-Jr ever doing a double spend attack fwiw. I know that there's been discussion of what happened to coiled coin but it wasn't a double spend which would imply financial motive. Here is how an attacker with 51% or more of the hash rate can bankrupt your exchange. For this example I use i0coin:1) Attacker starts mining a new blockchain fork, starting from the existing block.2) Attacker deposits i0coin in your exchange.3) Attackers fork of the chain in (1) does not include this deposit transaction.4) Attacker sends the same coins as (2) to another address they own and this transaction is included in the blockchain fork in (1).5) After the required number of confirmations attacker trades for bitcoins and withdraws the bitcoins.6) When (1) is longer than the existing main chain attacker publishes their fork.7) repeat from (1)The result of (6) is that the exchange loses the i0coins due to the transaction no longer being valid. The transaction in (4) has replaced it. The exchange can't reverse the bitcoin withdrawal as the coins are already gone.The exchange can't detect this offline mining. There's no way to know someone is building the blockchain fork in advance. The exchange can only notice the chain reorg after the fact. By that time all the coins are gone.It doesn't matter how many confirmations you wait to confirm the deposit in (2). If the attacker has greater than 51% then eventually they will have a longer chain and can force a reorg. It doesn't matter if you process withdrawals manually. The attacker just waits until you've confirmed the btc withdraw and then publishes their fork.The attacker can even re-use the i0coins they used in the attack to repeat the process since they still own them.If the alt coin is able to be merge mined then there is no cost to the attacker. They essentially perform the attack for free since they are mining bitcoins at the same time. If it is not a merge mineable coin then the attacker has the opportunity cost of them not mining bitcoins. The amount taken from the exchange can compensate for this however.In this attack note the attacker started mining the fork before they initiated the fraudulent deposit. This makes it much easier to reverse since they don't need to go back X blocks and mine from there - as the wiki entry you quote notes this could be computationally difficult. Although with >51% they'll eventually get there. That doesn't help though. If someone has greater than 50% you can wait as many hours as you want but they can still double spend. I'm not trying to trash your idea, I'm just giving you a heads up on the risk from someone who had an i0coin exchange double spent in this manner for about 200 btc. It was an expensive lesson. How do you plan to protect against double spend attacks on low hash rate alt-coins? Only the source, sorry.The namecoin data contains a copy of the bitcoin block header, not a reference to the header in the bitcoin chain. Imagine that namecoin is being merge mined and a block is found on the bitcoin chain, resulting in a block found in the namecoin chain. Now imagine all future blocks on the namecoin chain are mined by solo namecoin miners. These miners don't use merge mining and don't connect to bitcoin at all. Then the bitcoin chain reorgs invalidating the original bitcoin block. The solo miners will not know about this and continue mining, no affect on the chain.Another reason a 'reorg' won't affect namecoin is that the the hash that solved the namecoin block is still a valid namecoin hash. The fact that someone built on a different bitcoin block in the primary chain, and invalidating the original block, does not stop the fact that the namecoin block had a valid namecoin hash and that miners are building on that namecoin block. Merge miners can start working on the new re-orged bitcoin main chain, but continue building on the existing valid namecoin block that was solved previously.It is possible that a merge miner could cause a reorg on both chains though. That miner could be mining a bitcoin chain that becomes the main chain and they could be mining a namecoin chain that becomes a new chain too. It's possible that the same reason they created a fork on bitcoin causes a fork on namecoin. For example a large miner mining offline for a short period. A reorg in the mainchain does not affect the auxiliary chains. They are entirely separate. The original patches are the only thing I know of.That branch was a work in progress of my own to port i0coin to a more recent bitcoin. Unfortunately the new nodes were not getting peers and I lacked time to investigate.The high memory usage is inherited from bitcoin. My bitcoin node uses >1GB at times as well. With i0coin's faster blocks it uses more. I don't know why this would be happening.
Thanks, I'm investigating. There may be some down time during restarts while I tweak things. I'm aiming for the end of the month. For the litecoin and ppcoin exchange you can deposit as many times as you want to the same address, before or after previous confirmations, and they'll be picked up correctly.For the namecoin exchange you can only deposit once to an address but it only calculates the amount once the number of confirmations have gone through. So if you do multiple deposits before the confirmation limit then they will be picked up. At some point I'll move the namecoin exchange over to the same software as the litecoin/ppcoin exchange so it gets the reusable address functionality. It's collected a total of about two since it's been in operation and this is primarily due to initially having a largish PPC balance to handle the startup of the pool. It does seem the turnover from withdrawals prevents POS stakes from having a chance of happening. If TRC is a clone of bitcoin it can't be merge mined alongside bitcoin. It'd need chain breaking patches to do that. You could merge mine it with namecoin and others however. No plans at this stage. A large number go towards the open source developers don't they? I suspect many receiving them don't even know, or have forgotten, they are getting them. I have 18 connections from my client running v32509. What version of the client are you running?  What does being a moderator give you in terms of special powers?* Can you see the IP address of posters and identify sock puppets?* Can you delete threads?* Can you ban users?* Can you merge threads?* Can you lock threads?* Can you unlock threads that were locked by the original poster?As a moderator, what would you most like to do the Alt concurrency forum? Since you are asking for the post I'm assuming there's something about it you'd like to see different. The was a few minutes downtime just now while I restarted ppcoind to work around the memory leak. You bitcoins won't be sent because they can't be sent to a litecoin address. The error message is due to the send bailing out trying to send to an invalid address:Code:$ bitcoind validateaddress LhkK5VtmAHZpX5tySaMERoHMneehNjc5zP{    "isvalid" : false} Bitparking uses 0x00000000ffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for difficulty 1 shares.  Does it show up if you hack the client to not check the hash on blocks and to assume every submission is correct (running on a private testnet of course). This should help find it faster. It's fine to mine on one accounts. The hash rate estimate on the site is pretty inaccurate and is only based on share submissions over a short time period. Mining on two accounts is only really needed if you want your miners mining at different difficulty levels. You can't have two miners on one account with different difficulty levels. I use getwork, getdifficulty, sendtoaddress and getmemorypool. It does seem proportional to the getwork requests. When my pool hashrate was greater than 100Ghash it was losing 1GB of memory a day. Now that it's low I only need to restart the ppcoind once a week or so when it reaches 4-5GB of memory. Setting the reserve balance does not change the ppcoind coin selection aglorithm. So even if I dynamically set the reserve to the level of the sum of all users selected reserves, withdrawals can come out of the high coin age balances unfortunately. There was a couple of minutes downtime as I restarted the pool to workaround a ppcoind memory leak. Can you run a miner? Steps that might reproduce:* Set up a difficulty 1 ppcoind 'testnet in a box'* Run the ppcoind instances under valgrind* Mine a few blocks* Check valgrind reports Pool is back online.
Pool will be down for a couple of minutes while I swap bitcoind instances. The pool is having a bumpy ride at the moment due to two things:1) The blockchain database for bitcoind corrupted so it's running off a secondary bitcoin daemon which has a bit more lag2) The blockchain is being re-downloaded which is causing high cpu/disk usage while it catches up (about 8k blocks to go) which is impacting the web server performanceOnce (2) completes I'll switch back to it and things will stabalize. I'll then look at what can be done to avoid this in the future. Thanks, daemon had crashed. I'm restarting it now and it'll pick them up shortly. It's 6 confirmations plus up to 90 seconds depending on how long it takes for the process that polls to check for the 6 confirmations wakes up. How many confirmations are you at? And we're up again. Something seems to be wrong with the wallet and/or block index of my bitcoind as it's not updating with new blocks. I've switched to another bitcoind instance and we're mining on that for now while I investigate/fix the old one. The new bitcoind wallet has no coins in it so withdrawals will hit the "no funds" warning but a transfer is in progress so they'll work again soon. And we're down again, sigh. Working on it. Pool is back up. It took longer than expected as bitcoind was failing an assert on startup. Pool is down for a few minutes while I restart the bitcoind due to a hang. What makes you think this? The only limit on withdrawals is if the hot wallet runs low and needs to be topped up. There's a delay while the top up gets confirmed. There can be delays too if someone with a balance greater than the hot wallet balance tries to withdraw all their coins - if they withdraw in small amounts though it works.Edit: I just read your quoted section. The reason that user couldn't withdraw is they were trying to withdraw less than the minimum amount of 0.01 ppc/btc. Glad it's sorted. Let me know if you have any other issues. I have not seen it - is it still happening? We've just come off a very long block - almost 5x difficulty, so I'm wondering if the longer blocks see reduced performance over time. PM me or email admin@bitparking.com:* The exchange you used (PPC)* Your account name* The amount you tried to withdraw* The browser and version you are using.With that information I can track down what's happening. Variance with pools is enormous. The pool can expect to be 10x up or down that at least. Looking into it, thanks. Not yet but it's planned. Thanks! I do plan to implement one or the other (or both). Hopefully before the end of October I'll have something going. My pool is using the one on http://i0coin.bitparking.com/. I've been unable to get the kR105 one to work consistently. It slowly disconnects all the peers over time. I assume this has something to do with the DoS code - it doesn't seem to like existing peers. I had the same problem trying to port i0coin to a recent bitcoin as well so I don't think it's a bug with the kR105 code specifically. Yes. I keep most funds in a cold wallet so regularly send the hot wallet back to the cold wallet, and retop up the hot wallet from the cold wallet so it's compact. This is normal and occurs when a large number of inputs are used to create the transaction, exceeding the allowed size limit. It's the bane of exchanges that often get lots of small deposits and large withdrawals. I regularly have to compact my wallet by consolidating addresses. It's an issue with pools too where the reward per block is small and people wait until large amounts accrue before withdrawing. Thread for the Namecoin exchange is here, although it doesn't get much traffic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=11530
Vircurex volume for BTC/NMC is showing a volume of 10. Or am I reading it wrong? Is their volume in BTC? It's completed orders for the last 24 hours. There would be nothing stopping people from using ppcoin as the parent chain and merge mining other auxiliary chains afaik. You'd need to patch ppcoin if you want to use the namecoin merge mine proxy but it would remain compatible with normal ppcoin blocks. What you can't do is merge mine ppcoin and bitcoin together. Yes moving funds resets the time. I'd be more inclined to add proof of stake incoming earning to the exchange first. An interesting approach would be a "proof of stake pool" which would really be an online wallet but optimized for ensuring fund movement minimizes effect on coin age.  Good idea, I've limited it to the last 50 blocks. The pool ran out of funds overnight, I'll top it up. The 520 confirmations is a killer Edit: Topped up. Any bitcoin calculator should work. For example, putting your hashrate and the ppcoin difficulty into this one gives about 10 hours on average, or 1 day 6 hours to 95%. Are you sure you don't have immature blocks? They won't show up in your balance and take 520 blocks to mature. There will be a few minutes outage shortly as I update the ppcoind and restart to workaround the memory leak.Edit: Restart complete. The exchange keeps most of its funds in an offline wallet so want currently participate towards mining proof of stake using them. I suspect the hot wallet sees too much churn (withdrawals/deposits) for proof of stake to happen. I'll be keeping on eye out on how proof of stake works in practice and I'd like to look at a way of having user balances credited with their contribution to any that happens.  When you mine on the pool you mine at difficulty 1 like most bitcoin pools. If you have a very high hashrate you might like to mine at a slightly higher difficulty to reduce network traffic. You can do this by following the instructions in the first post. Set your password to "d=x" where "x" is a number. "x" can't be higher than the current ppcoin difficulty as this would make no sense - you'd be losing money. You don't have to do any of this though if all you want to do is mine at difficulty 1. PPCoin has the same difficulty for the proof of work blocks as bitcoin. As hash rate goes up, difficulty goes up. You'll see a change when you submit a block successfully. Check your username is correct and then you use the correct uppercase/lowercase letters. I'm not sure it has much meaning to compare difficulty value of coins that use different algorithms. Yes. Yes it can be mined. Difficulty is about 13,000. Any bitcoin miner can be used. According to coinotron it is less profitable to mine ppcoin if your goal is to earn bitcoins by selling them. Yes. There's a variety of methods that can be used to attack that though. Connect to lots of nodes, analyse where the checkpointing is coming from, DoS that node, then 51% attack the network for example. I think it's mentioned in their PPCoin paper. It is instant, unless the amount is unusually large, or empties the exchanges hot wallet. I don't see any pending withdrawals so I assume you got the funds. If not, PM me your username, the amount, and the address you were withdrawing too and I'll take a look. Pool is back up. It took a little longer than expected as I ran it under valgrind to get some memory leak information for a few minutes.
Pool is going down for a couple of minutes to restart ppcoind to reclaim the 5Gb of memory it's using due to a memory leak. It's custom code written by me in the Ur/Web programming language. It's not open source at this stage. Was PPCoin based on a stable bitcoin release? If so, what commit id, so I can get a diff of just the PPCoin change. This wasn't really an attack, which implies malicious intent, but was a consequence of the difficulty adjustment algorithm and chain hopping. People would mine namecoin when it was profitable, driving up the difficulty, and then leave when it wasn't and it would take a long time to come down. The people mining weren't deliberately attacking the chain, they were mining for profit. What attack on namecoin are you referring to? What's your username on the pool and I'll look it up. Are you sure you used the correct username, with the correct case? Bitparking is "Yes" to "Pay Orphans". Coinotron does PPS now too so I assume it has instant payouts. getwork calls CreateNewBlock, has that changed? The pool also called getdifficulty. Does your mining give a reason for the rejects? The pool sends out a header explaining why it rejected the share, I see it on my pool as well. Running 64bit Linux it's at 4.6g. The exchange doesn't though, it's at 185m so I assume it's something mining related. No they are on different servers and have different wallets. i0coins will still be mined as long as the chain is stable. If you've got a vircurex address registered you'll need to register a new account on the pool to mine with new addresses before vircurex close the doors on the chain. I'll look at setting up a quick i0coin webwallet based on my exchange code over the weekend so those who don't want to run an i0coin client  can register an address to store coins. Another option is to ask vircurex if they'll give you the private key for the i0coin deposit address you are using.Each registered username needs to mine at a specific difficulty. So if you want two miners mining at different difficulty levels you'll need to register two names. They can share the same payout addresses however. If you try mining at different difficulties with the same username you'll get errors returned. The times I've seen this have been when the miner thinks the pool took to long in responding to a share submission and so sends it again.  Coinotron has difficulty and profitability. Bitcoin miners work. Reward is linked to difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the lower the reward. I have this page. The userid's are the first few characters of the sha256 hash of the miners username. Blocks themselves show at block origin or you can poll pool_history.txt. Haha, yes it is. I'm impressed with how your site shows all the important information so nicely and I rage at my inability to do pretty sites! PM me your username and I'll compensate you for the lost shares. Ran out of money overnight, sorry! Funds are back up. The extra hash power is outrunning the 520 block confirmation so it's been requiring constant top ups at the moment. There was a brief restart just now as merge mining of the alt chains was resumed. I'll be tracking the performance and hopefully it'll stick.
Coinotron has a profitability calculator for Litecoin and PPC at the top right of their page. Correct, it's a cumulative sum. it should do. It's running the same software and setup as my bitcoin pool which has 200Gh/s at the moment and has reached 300+. Assuming I didn't mess something up when converting it to ppcoin  Pool had a couple of minutes downtime as I upgraded some software. The main improvement is adding the ability for miners to select their own difficulty level to mine at. It defaults to a difficulty of 1 but if you set your miners password to "d=8" you will mine at difficulty level 8. You can change "8" to any number. All PPS rewards will be multiplied by that value. It should be a non-decimal number. This will result in less submissions to the pool reducing bandwidth and improving performance.  Yes, slush's example will be useful. My pool is custom software which I think will actually make it easier for me since I know it better than trying to add support to other pool software. I think it's great that you and slush sorted out the differences between the proposals and hope the new protocol gets some traction.  I adjusted the payout instead as suggested by someone here. On the site it says:At the moment the pool isn't mining any of the alt coins as I announced here a couple of days ago while I track down a performance issue. I'm still paying out the alt chain PPS from pool reserves though. I'm hoping to re-enable them this weekend. It'll take a while for those of us who've only just seen it to implement it. I'm interested in adding support for it to my pool but it'll take time to write and test. Yep, the same thing happened during the early namecoin days. People would hop to my namecoin pool when the namecoin price reached a point where it was more profitable to mine them and sell for bitcoins. I'm expecting a drop in hashrate when the price drops. Unless people start using PPCoins for something of course. Some will remain interested to see what happens with proof of stake as well. PM me your account details and I'll look into it. Done, sorry about that. Pool was more popular than expected! The variable difficulty stuff is only recently implemented so if you see problems let me know. I haven't enabled that on my other pool yet but I will do once it's seen a bit more testing. Yes, I think the pool I ran based on puddinpop's code was the first public pool. It predated the "Difficulty 1" mining idea that I think Slush came up with. Here's the original pool page and the thread about it. I've started a PPCoin pool that pays out using PPS. Dedicated thread here. Pool closed, sorry. From the pool page: Code:C: SUBMIT,129,00000001,abcdef12S: SHARE,ACCEPTC: SUBMIT,129,00000001,21fedcbaS: SHARE,ACCEPTC: SUBMIT,129,00000005,419be9cfS: SHARE,ACCEPTAfter a "SUBMIT" does the connection not process any more submissions until "SHARE" is returned?

What does the server use it for?Is there an error response from the server to indicate bad data sent by the client (eg. malformed hex strings, signed numbers vs unsigned,etc) or will it just disconnect? What effect does proof of stake have on a services wallet? I see there's a thread that's run that does proof of stake mining. What does this do to existing coins older than X days in a users wallet? Are they consumed? Or  are they sent from one address to another?There's an RPC command 'reservebalance'. What does this do exactly? Should a merchant use 'reservebalance' to ensure they have funds available to service clients while proof of stake calculations are going on? What's the CPU usage like of that ongoing proof of stake mining thread? Nice, thanks for the clarification! They pay out only when they find a block though don't they, which is a bit unusual for PPS pools. What happens when the PPS payment is more than the block payment? I've implemented a way for users to adjust the difficulty they mine at so large hash rate users can reduce the number of network requests to send results to the pool. If anyone is interested in testing this please PM me and I'll provide details. I'm not sure what you mean. Are you saying you are only get 0.000015 btc per share? Can you PM me the username you used and details on what mining software you are using and I'll look into it.
What changes should be made to the DGM calculation in the presence of miners that are mining at different difficulty levels? For example, a pool that dynamically adjusts difficulty based on the users hashrate, or one that allows the user to select their own target value? This is normal on old cpuminer versions as they submitted difficulty 1 shares always. This means you get a bunch of false proof of works for those that don't meet the actual target difficulty. Bitparking pays orphans, as I think most PPS pools do but most pools in the PPS list seem to have No there. How does "Pay stales" work? For those with a "Yes" does that mean a miner can ignore longpolls, get a bunch of getworks in advance, and chug through those even though they may end up woefully out of date and stale? Or is there a limit? If a pool only pays stales for a short time after a block change does that count as "Pay stales"? Yes but there's work that can never be useful. For example a miner that ignores longpoll's. They'll have higher stales and be submitting work that can never result in a valid block more often than someone who handles longpolls. But they get the same reward as the latter so why bother dealing with longpolls. What PPS pools pay for stales? That sounds like a great way for a pool to bankrupt itself paying out for work that isn't valid. I see Bitparking took the hit for everyone's good luck over the week! I'm not aware of anyone working on it for any of the alt chains.  Is 'getmemorypool' returning the wrong coinbasevalue for PPCoin? it currently returns '1298080000' but the last block minted was '1298.17000000'. 1298080000/1e8 = 12.9808. Or am I miscalculating something? No, I was referring to you as I knew you ran it  It seems to be near impossible for an alt coin to die. Even coiledcoin is seeing mining power applied to it and that has no exchange or any infrastructure. It's not possible to merge mine PPCoin with bitcoin. The PPCoin designers did not add this functionality (by design) and making the changes to the coin would not be network compatible with existing PPCoin miners. A pool could probably merge mine PPCoin with the other alt coins (Namecoin, etc) if they added the appropriate patches to PPCoin though since this is generally network compatible. For anyone still using i0coin, the block where the subsidy halves has been reached again. It's now 12 i0coins/block. See my message here for details on the closing of the exchange: I've temporarily disabled merge mining while I track down a performance issue. The pool is only mining the bitcoin chain at the moment. It is however paying out the other chains from the pools reserve so users don't lose out but alt chain users may notice a hash rate drop on their chain. I'll update here when I begin merge mining the others again. There was a few minutes of downtime as the pool found a bitcoin block and chugged through the large share database which backed everything up. I've installed a fix for the issue of handling large numbers of shares. Thanks. I'm mostly concerned about checkpoints for now since ppcoin is so new and the blockchain aspects of it are less understood (by me anyway). I've set up a bitparking ppcoin exchange and I'll see how it goes as to whether it's a long term thing or not.   Another long block, 13 million shares so far. Fun times in pool land! Is there a way with the RPC API to identify when the last PPCoin checkpoint occurred? So a merchant/exchange can know a safe point where a transaction won't be rolled back? Pool is down for a bitcoind patch. Back up shortly.Edit: Pool is up now. Are you mining on a pool with LTC but not with PPC? If so the 'yay' is from difficulty 1 shares and you'll get more of them. 
A couple of minutes downtime just now as I updated bitcoind on the server. No, the effect is it pays out the transaction fee value for the current block being worked at as part of the PPS payment. So each PPS increment for the user is adjusted based on the fees for that block being worked on, even though the pool hasn't received those fees and might not if it doesn't solve that actual block. Over time it should balance out though.Currently bitparking doesn't pay out transaction fees at all. That's what the effect would be. I haven't implemented it yet though so not currently paying out Tx fees. The approach I've been considering implementing is paying a PPS value based on the actual value of the block that getwork creates. This would include transaction fees for the block. It'd make the PPS value slightly variable as transactions are included in blocks being hashed. A downside might be if an outlier transaction with a large fee is in a block and the pool pays out PPS for it but doesn't win it - it might take longer to recover from that. if transactions fees are evenly distributed across blocks it might not be too bad. I assume this is how DGM pools include transaction fees? bitcoind daemon on the pool has hung. I'm restarting it now.Edit: Back up now. Thanks for the update, I've left X-Roll-NTime disabled for now while I do more testing on it.I found an issue that was causing stales whenever a bitcoin block was found by the network. At the time the pool learns of the new block there are a number of getwork results still queued to go to miners but have stale block data. These were still going out so a number of miners could get stale work. This may have been the cause of the "upstream sent stale" that someone mentioned in a previous comment. I've fixed this now by refreshing the stale blocks in the queued work before sending them to the miners.There's still a period of time between when the pool learns about the block, and when miners receive their longpoll result that some miners will be submitting stale work. I've enabled a threshold for this time period where the pool pays out on stale shares for a short time so miners aren't affected by the pools inefficiency in this area.Another area of stales was when I restart the pool. For a short period miners submitting work had them registered as stale due to the worker log in the pool being flushed on restart. I've corrected for this so no work is unpaid immediately after a restart. I made some pool changes to hopefully improve the stale situation today. Let me know if you see more or less stales. I'm not sure what that means either. What miner are you using? I'll look into it.Edit: Nevermind, found code in bfgminer for it. Looking into it. A couple of things I've noticed so far:* I really need to improve longpoll times when bitcoin blocks are found. This is where the majority of stales is coming from.* One miner is submitting a lot of duplicate hashes. They'll be seeing these as stales and they'll be fairly high. Your username begins with 'e'. If you think it's you, PM me. Possibly you may need to update your mining software. The pool had a quick restart a few minutes ago to install some stale tracking code. This restart also adds the HTTP header X-Reject-Reason to any returned result that's the result of a stale or other invalid share. This can be used to help identify why you are getting stales. I picked that header based on the getwork wiki page. I'm investigating the high stale issue. The recent changes to the pool that might affect it have been:* Enable X-Roll-NTime* Rejecting block times outside a specific range* Statistics trackingI've temporarily disabled X-Roll-NTime to see if that's the issue. If they're still high I'll check the block time rejection and the statistics. Upgrade done. Pool is back up. Pool will go down for a few minutes shortly to install a bitcoin update. Their NZ phone number is a Skype purchased "online number" based on the first few digits (889 xxxx comes from Skype) so they could be anywhere in the world. NZ is popular for setting up shell companies for some reason. The fact their company address is a mail forwarding business seems to point that way. Their business address isn't far from where I am. If I went to the building and looked do you think I'd see what they show in their company photo's, or just a shell company plaque? I'm not familiar with cgminer - what numbers should I be looking at? Is there a document available on the new protocol? Are you interested in other pools implementing it? Assuming I've implemented it right, pool now supports X-Roll-NTime. Although if we get many more 9 million+ share blocks like the current one I might have to rethink before going bankrupt! Pool needs more good luck! Thanks for using the pool! I'm not planning to go DGM but I was tracking DGM stats to compare payouts. If I did enable DGM it'd be an option and I'd keep PPS but I don't see me doing DGM in the near future.  It doesn't seem to be very good for sporadic miners and I think that form of mining will become more common as people switch pools regularly for backups, etc. I also much prefer the simplicity of PPS in terms of data the pool needs to keep. Currently most of my pool development efforts are going towards improving performance and scaling. 
Well that was fun - unexpected pool downtime for 20 minutes or so. I've temporarily disabled DGM stats collection which was causing score updates to fall behind. I installed a queuing system for updating share data recently to help with performance. Unfortunately this resulted in hash rate estimates to be under-reported in times when the pool comes under load and the queue builds up. I'll fix this in the next update, sorry.The pool hash rate has picked up again, ranging 200-300+ at the moment with some miners that mine for a time period then leave. I'm wondering if it's the result of being a backup pool for people that kicks in when their main pool has issues. Yeah I assume they don't treat alt stales as the whole result being stale. I seem to recall that high stales on p2pool is normal but doesn't mean the same thing as high stales on standard pools so it's not a big issue. Luckily we had a few good short blocks earlier so it balances out. The pool ran really bad in the early days, and someone ripped the pool off for about 300 btc back then after finding a flaw, so it's still catch up. In total it's 800 btc behind or so. Variance is crazy. It an easily be +-600 btc at any time.I haven't decided on whether to go DGM yet - I'm just running stats for curiosities sake for now. If I did I'd do them side by side. That was a horrible block at 6,907,591 shares. Hopefully we don't get too many of those! p2pool has 10 second longpoll times. High stales are likely to be expected. Does it consider a result a stale if it's stale on the altchain but not the primary chain? I don't really see much difference between a pool where people mine with their own hardware and one where they buy shares so someone else can buy hardware, mine with it, and pay the proceeds to them. If the goal of bounties is to get people using devcoin then I think the bounty would best be reworded so this usage is allowed. Ok, I think I understand now. People don't mine in your pool with their own equipment. Instead they buys shares in a company which buys mining equipment and mines using it. The income from that mining operation is paid out to shareholders in either bitcoins or devcoins. Is that right? I'm confused how this works. It's a private p2pool node so people don't actually mine with you? If they do, where are the details to mine? There was a few seconds of downtime a short time ago as I installed some pool updates to help with performance. You probably only registered a bitcoin and namecoin address. Register a new id and put in addresses for the other coins you want to receive. Do you have a page somewhere that describes how one accesses your Open Transactions exchange in simple terms so ordinary users can use it? How does that translate into an exchange rate that can be used by someone to work out values for conversion? Where's the list of recent trades? That's also an unsecured html page on some random domain with no proof it belongs to open transactions or that it has been modified "in flight" via mitm attack. How would one determine what the exchange rate is on Open Transactions? I don't see a list of trades or current rate or anything. These don't look like pools. How does it work?How does this pay Devcoins? You might want to include instructions on how users mine there for those not familiar with p2pool. For example, what username, password, how they get rewards, etc. http://p2pool.knotwork.com:10332/fee returns 100. Is that a 100% fee? What's to stop the pool from offering a conversion of 0.00000001 devcoin per 100 bitcoin, or something terrible like that just to gain the bounty? Is there a time limit or required hash rate limit before the bounty is given to stop someone starting a pool with almost no users, getting the bounty, then shutting it down? By conversion I assume you mean not just paying out of devcoins earned as part of the process of mining? But conversion of other coins earned as part of the process of mining into bitcoins?What unit is the bounty denominated in? ie. 12 what. 520 to mature IIRC. I think 'newmint' can be ignored. It only tells you how many coins are immature.
If ppcoin has 'getblock' then you can "getblock" on the hash of the block and that gives the block height.A way to do it is to determine the reward for the block associated with the work you've given a user and compute the PPS specific to the value of that block for the shares they return. That's if you're paying PPS s shares are submitted. If you're paying after a block is found you can use "getblock" to find the value and compute the PPS from that. Do you have a page showing list of recent trades and volumes? Yes it mines all those coins at once. Not that I'm aware of. You'd have to ask Vircurex. Didn't ABC just raise their fees? Did you change 'pchMessageStart'? If not someone who accidentally connects to the bitcoin network with ppcoin will bridge them and IP addresses will be shared. Could this result in bitcoin transactions being sent (and rejected) to ppcoin? I see this in the ppcoin debug log a lot:Code:******* exception encountered *******ProcessMessages(tx, 225 bytes) : Exception 'CDataStream::read() : end of data' caught, normally caused by a message being shorter than its stated lengthProcessMessage(tx, 225 bytes) FAILED A couple of issues you might need to address (I don't know if these are different for ppcoin but for alt chains you often have to tinker with them):* Longpoll notification when a block is found. * Reward per block varies based on difficulty - it's not just bitcoins 50 coins. With 11 blocks solved since collecting DGM stats the numbers are interesting. So far DGM would have paid out 140+ bitcoins more than PPS. This is a bit of a skewed view though since the pool has been running well with no blocks with scores greater than difficulty since I started running the stats. I'm sure it'll balance out when that happens. Pity I didn't run the stats two weeks earlier when the pool was running bad! The managers of the top level .st domain went AWOL. see http://blorn.com/post/29851770158/beware-cutesy-two-letter-tlds-for-your-domain-name Luke-Jr's changes are in a branch of the repository called 'ppcoin'. You need to do something like:Code:git clone https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin.git ppcoincd ppcoingit checkout -b ppcoin origin/ppcoin...now you can build ppcoin.... Did you change to the ppocoin branch after cloning? Are you pointing them to 127.0.0.1 port 9902? It's running. Open up another cmd prompt and run something like "ppcoind getinfo" and you'll see output as it connects to the one running in the first window. Open a second cmd.exe window after running ppcoin.exe in the other. Run "ppcoin.exe getinfo" in that other window and you should see something come back. Same with bitparking btw. I would have thought all PPS pools were "don't have to wait for 120 confirmations". mmpool.bitparking.com used to do anonymous by address but when I switched to merge mining I needed a way for a user to provide all the alt coin addresses so I switched to needing to register where you supply the alt coin addresses at registration time. It's still anonymous though since it doesn't require any email addresses, passwords, etc.The other option I considered was having an anonymous address and having the alt coins send to that address too - the user could then import the private key into their alt coin wallets but this was a bit technical for some users. The pool doesn't get the additional coins. The generation coins the miner gets are the 10%. The remaining 90% are distributed as part of the mined block to addresses belonging to 'open source developers'. These addresses are obtained from a csv file that is regularly downloaded by the client and controlled by the devcoin developers. It's a bit centralized compared to other coins - the developers control who gets what when coins are mined.  Their FAQ says 5% fee so same as OzCoin and BGTCGuild: https://eclipsemc.com/faq.php mmpool.bitparking.com has a PPS rate of 0.00002225.
I've added a user id 'estimated payout' portion of http://mmpool.bitparking.com/blockstats page. This Id is the first 8 characters of the sha256 hash of the username of the user. You can use a page like http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html to convert your username to a hash to see where you rank.Edit: And now there's a rough estimate of hash rate there as well. I've been looking at comparing other payment methods to PPS and have added a quick 'stats' page to which shows some data. The first payment method I'm comparing to is DGM as this seems to be a reasonable alternative to PPS which helps lower variance for the pool operator. For the curious the stats are here: http://mmpool.bitparking.com/blockstatsThis page shows under the 'Current' heading the current number of difficulty 1 solutions (as Score) and the amount of PPS that has been paid so far for the current block being worked on. On average a block will be solved by the pool every 'Difficulty' score submissions. This number gives you an idea of how far into a block we are and how unlucky we are if we're way above difficulty.Under 'Blocks' is a list of the blocks that have been solved since I added the payment comparison stats. So far there have only been two full blocks. They show the total amount that would be paid to all miners using the DGM payment method, the total amount actually paid using the existing PPS system, the difference between the two, and the score total that solved the block (number of difficulty 1 solutions submitted by miners).As you can see with the two block solved there is a bit of variance there with DGM being higher in the 2nd block and PPS in the first. In both cases the PPS is less than the 50 for the block due to both blocks being solved 'early' (less than the the difficulty number of submissions).The 'Totals' section sums up the DGM and PPS payments over all the blocks and compares them. It also compares them to the block reward to see if the pool is losing or making money. For those two blocks the pool has been lucky. For the last number of blocks it's been a bit unlucky unfortunately so it's actually in the negative a fair amount (hence my reason for looking at lower variance reward options in case I need to change).Under Estimated Payout is the current values for all miners mining the current block. It is sorted by total score (difficulty 1 submissions by the miner). It shows approximately what the payout for the miner would be using DGM if the block was found. It also shows the current PPS payment made to that miner and the score. At times DGM will be higher than PPS or lower depending on long it is taking to solve the block.I don't show the miner user id for privacy reasons. Is there interest in that though? Or maybe a hash of the miner Id? It makes an interesting leaderboard.Note that stats shown on this page are cached so are not 'immediate'. They are also generated by a seperate stats gathering module so may not represent the exact values you're getting in PPS but should be close. These stats are using floating point values rather than dealing with 'coins' so have some roundof errors. My DGM code may have bugs so another reason for this page is for me to test the implementation. The stats also show bitcoin values only. Comments welcome! Any other data of interest? Bitparking will be moving to permanent addresses soon. I tested the changes for this in the litecoin exchange I recently started and it seems to be working well enough to enable on the namecoin exchange.  I was on a pacific island for three weeks in April/May where they only have power about 12 hours a day - I can relate! I'll recover the funds for you. Note to those reading, this was on the namecoin exchange which doesn't allow re-depositing to an existing address. The litecoin exchange does allow re-deposits so I wouldn't need to recover manually. Once you hit 'Approve' on the pending withdraw and it no longer appears there the funds are transferred immediately. I don't see any outstanding transactions - all have been confirmed. Is your bitcoin blockchain up to date? Do you see the funds in a block explorer? PM me your username and withdrawal address and I'll investigate. You may have noticed a few disconnects of 30 seconds or so today as I updated some of the pool software. Things should be back to normal now. Total LTC in sell orders on BTC-E is 1.1 million+. I assume there's more in user balances so could possibly be one of their wallets. mmpool is still merge mining them. I'd planned to stop I0C as the number of stales and orphans made it non breakeven for the PPS pool. Currently it's still going but at a much reduced PPS rate to break even. The i0coin daemon is also using over a gig of memory and the frequent block rate results in a performance hit when merge mining since a new bitcoin block is created internally for mining when the aux changes have a new block. According to share submissions we've hit 300 Ghash/s, mostly from one large miner. Last  time this happened someone had discovered a flaw in the pool but I don't see evidence of this at the moment since we're solving the alternate chain blocks at the expected rate. I'll  keep monitoring it to make sure nothing untoward is happening. When you log into vircurex you can see all the pairs on the right. They do indeed allow trading all supported currencies against each other. Please PM me details of your username, the miner you are using and the command line arguments you are passing it and I'll look into it. Also available in json format at http://mmpool.bitparking.com/stats About 150 GH/s.  Litecoin cant be merge mined. It uses a different proof of work algorithm ,and doesn't have the necessary chanages to be merge mineable. Due to issues with i0coin mining I've had to withdraw support for it from the pool. Unfortunately the number of stales from the coin make it not break even for the pool to pay a reasonable PPS rate for it. The pool has been making a loss mining i0coin coins and has been covering the shortfall with existing i0coin funds which are now depleted. Existing users with a registered i0coin address will continue to receive coins for a short period of time until it is turned off and withdrawals will remain enabled for longer. Once withdrawals are turned off all remaining i0coins will be sent to users registered i0coin address. Both sides. I believe this is how the other exchanges work but if I'm wrong let me know. I've been told it works fine on the namecoin exchange since the last couple of Chrome releases so it should work.  I've added cumulative sums to the order list on the main page showing the total of LTC and BTC in the buy and sell orders. It clutters the interface a bit, I'm not sure if it'll stay. Let me know if you think it's useful or not. Past experience with running alt coin exchanges has showed me that 0.2% isn't enough to cover expenses - I used to be 0.2% for a while with the namecoin and other coin exchanges I ran. It's better to start at a point where expenses are covered then as volumes increase reduce the price rather than start low, run at a loss and have to increase prices.Edit: Adjusted the fee to 0.2% and the withdrawal transaction fee down to 0.01. Let's see how that goes for a bit.
Can you PM me the open id provider you are using? See my message here for details on the closing of the exchange: Something like:Code:litecoind listtransactions "" 1000|egrep -A3 'immature|generate' Pool is having issues with the bitcoin daemon hanging. I've restarted it again and will monitor it to try and find out the problem. Pool is back online now. Pool down due to a daemon crash. Bringing it back up now. Does your balance still show your namecoins? If so, your order didn't take into account the fees. Click the "Calculate" button and it'll tell you how much to take into account for that. If your balance has the order subtracted from it but it doesn't show in your list of orders then the trade went through immediately. The process of submitting to the aux chain involves a couple of RPC calls. One to the aux chain and one to the parent chain. This is repeated for all aux chains being mined. Then an RPC is done to the parent chain again to check if it solves the parent block. If the parent chain is done first then the call made as part of the aux chain check can become invalid (my understanding based on code inspection). There's also a cost in more possibility of orphans. Before submitting a result to the parent chain a number of requests are made to the auxiliary chains to see if they've been solved. The more auxiliary chains you have, the longer the delay before the parent chain is informed of the resulting hash. If the daemons for the auxiliary chains are overloaded then that delay can be even longer. If some other miner finds a result in that delay time you can be orphaned.An attacker could work on giving a merge mining pool more orphans by overloading the auxiliary chains with transactions. Satoshidice caused overloading on the bitcoin chain. Imagine if each child chain a pool was merge mining was 'satoshidiced'. The load and delay would be magnified for each chain the pool was mining. I considered, and partially implemented, a similar idea with i0coin, dynamic checkpoints, where new checkpoints could be sent using the P2P protocol that are signed by the coin creator. Users could also use a command line argument to indicate who's checkpoints they trusted.In the end I came to the same conclusion as you though, more hash power, not more checkpoints, is a better answer. Maybe something like the checkpointing could be done for new coins as a safeguard though. Code is in my github repository for i0coin if interested. And as I wrote that one got confirmed. Can you let me know if they still show unconfirmed for you? It looks like the bitcoin network is under a fair bit of load. My node as almost 2000 transactions in the memory pool. That might be why things are taking longer to confirm. I see two unconfirmed transactions. I'm looking into it now. http://ideabank.opendns.com/story.php?title=NameCoins_as_a_DNS_Lookup The code doesn't seem to have changed the switch on times for BIP 16 and BIP 30 in main.cpp. This can cause issues depending on whether the new client or the old client has majority computing power and whether it hits this code. You might want to change the dates to a future time such that it turns on when it's likely more people are running the new code. You can convert the date formats at a site like http://www.convert-unix-time.com. Or have you turned off the relevant code somewhere else? If so, disregard :-) There were a few periods of downtime today while I updated some components of the pool. The downtime was just stopping and starting the pool so should only have been a few seconds. There was a period of increased stales during that time lasting about 5 minutes while I fixed a misbehaving component. The changes reduce the cpu load of the pool enabling it to handle load better. I was previously using the namecoin merge mining proxy to handle the merge mining. This was written in Python and becoming a bottleneck so I rewrote it in a lower level language to get better performance. Other than testing different ideas, none really. They're somewhat useful to see what will happen to bitcoin down the track. For example, geistgeld is pushing the memory limits with its large blockchain. i0coin is also getting up there. i0coin also shows that the code to halve coin subsidies works since it hit that a while back. Merge mining seems like a great idea for non-currency blockchains to give them security. Unfortunately there aren't any. Namecoin comes closest but people still use it as a currency. For currency based blockchains it seems to make that currency pretty much worthless.Maybe a currency could be done that merge mines up to block X to seed the coins widely, then at X it switches off merge mining and uses a different proof of work (like litecoin) from then on. The 'goldrush' during the merge mining phase might be fun to watch. Discussion on Namecoin development goes on in the namecoin forums. I'm currently working on pool backend improvements to enable it to scale better in case there's a dramatic increase in load, so hopefully. I'm certainly working towards it. See this post and related thread. It's a contentious issue so rather than concentrating on the who, concentrate on the fact that it happened. Any large pool or miner can do it, so any new merge-mineable coin would need to be able to handle it.
If you enable merge mining on Freicoin, how will you prevent large miners from taking over the chain as happened when coiledcoin was released? In that case a pool used merge mining to have >51% of mining power and refused to accept any blocks from anyone else. As a result they got all the coins and the chain was effectively dead.Not enabling merge mining has the issue of large miners from doing similar but they don't get the attack for free - they won't earn bitcoins while doing it. This attack pretty much stopped development of new alt coins from what I can tell. It is the latest version until the problems with the rebase on top of the current bitcoin are investigated and resolved. I'm seeing issues similar to what was reported when kr105's rebased version first came out about i0coin being on different block numbers. I've rolled back to v32509 while I investigate. How did you build it? I'm on Ubuntu and used:Code:make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=1 bitcoindOr are you building the GUI? I haven't tried that. I'll look into it. Source for i0coin version v60300 is available at http://i0coin.bitparking.com/. This is rebased on top of bitcoin v0.6.3 to pick up recent important fixes for security issues in bitcoin. It is based on kr105's work with his recent rebase and some fixes of mine. A checkpoint was added at block 367,000. The activation times for BIP 16 and BIP 30 are the same as what kr105 set them at. In the rebase I squashed everything into one commit to ease rebasing on top of future bitcoin changes. No binaries yet, but once I've worked out how to build bitcoin with Qt on my windows system I'll get a windows binary up. Upgrade done, pool is back online. There will be a few minutes downtime as I update the bitcoin version running on the pool sometime in the next hour. How's the fix for the 'time travel exploit' in bitcoin going? That was found and fixed in alt chains a while back. I know you don't like alt chains but some of the stuff that's resulted from them have improved bitcoin - particularly edge case bugs as a result of attacks on the coins (The time travel exploit, the database log file growth bug a while back, etc). You can get a free one at startssl.com. I agree, longpoll notification is slow. I wonder if using a lightweight message queuing system like zeromq would do a better job instead of the http based long polling. The no transactions in the recent bitparking blocks was due to a bug in my attempt to lower the cpu percentage that processing transactions was consuming. I've now fixed this and it should start showing transactions again.The issue the bitparking pool has had is the priority ordering of transactions in CreateNewBlock in main.cpp was causing lag in the pool and high percentage cpu usage of the bitcoind process when the memory pool had a large number of transactions. I have yet to investigate why since that function is supposed to only be called every 60 seconds or so. Perhaps it takes a lock that causes timeouts for miners or something. At some point I'll investigate and see if that was the cause. Changing this function so that less transactions were processed in the queue seemed to result in a large drop in cpu % (from 80% to 5%). After the two weeks you get the miners who hadn't switched to the BIP 16 enabled code getting orphans. Maybe there's a bunch of standalone miners running non-upgraded code that are unattended (remains of botnets, unattended servers, etc?) IIRC a bitcoin release candidate was used by some pools that had a BIP 16 switch on time 2 weeks earlier than what the official time eventually became. Pools and individual miners using this RC would have produced a lot of orphans until they noticed. This could cause increased confirmation times for a brief period when a chunk of the network was effectively offline. I don't think this was very long, nor was it a big chunk. CJDNS provides a virtual ipv6 address and allows connecting to the virtual ipv6 addresses of other nodes connected in the cjdns network. The traffic is encrypted and the real IP address of the endpoints are hidden. The real server IP is also hidden by the cjdns ipv6 address. I've added support to my bitparking pool to try it out. If anyone is using cjdns and wants to give mining through it a try:1. Install cjdns from https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns2. Connect to a cjdns peer. Possibly one from the public peer list or PM me for a connection to one of my nodes.3. Point your miner to: http://[fc9f:ee0a:c283:c945:ede0:8a59:78e7:99d6]:16098. Longpolling also runs over cjdns.4. Access the main pool website for withdrawals at: http://[fc9f:ee0a:c283:c945:ede0:8a59:78e7:99d6]:90/poolThis is an experiment and I'm interested in the performance of it. let me know your feedback if you try it. Testing mining to the pool using cjdns if anyone wants to be a guinea pig: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57148.msg969137#msg969137 I'm experimenting with a cjdns interface to the pool. Running cjdns provides a virtual ipv6 address and allows connecting to the virtual ipv6 addresses of other nodes connected in the cjdns network. The traffic is encrypted and the real IP address of the endpoints are hidden. One possible feature of this would be avoiding pool DDOS problems. If you'd like to experiment with this:1. Install cjdns from https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns2. Connect to a cjdns peer. Possibly one from the public peer list or PM me for a connection to one of my nodes.3.

I use http://i0coin.bitparking.com jSjhyibUEJreaee9s1cYKS3WUsJFEWN1YU Pool is back online. Waiting for a blockchain download before the pool comes back online. It takes a while to get those last 20k blocks or so!
The pool is going down for a short period for some maintenance to fix timeout issues. You got a 40BTC bounty for having a merge mining pool for DevCoin at the time merge mining was switched on didn't you? Think of the 'free' money as being a redistribution of that bounty to the users since the pool shut down soon after. I see a difficulty of 3284 or so, with 20 connections, using client v32509. It'd be interesting to know the IP's you are connected to. I'm using the i0coin.bitparking.com one. What 'getinfo' error are you getting?  This will never happen as you won't be able to get the majority of hash power to convert. Luke-jr (afaik) controls 600 Ghash or so of the chain and I doubt he'd update. i0coin mining is enabled again. I there there's a fix for it in the bitcoin tree. They had a similar error when they cause a fork at the time of BIP 16 and a release candidate had a date that it switched on too early.  You'll need to delete your existing blockchain files (don't delete your wallet.dat!) and download the blockchain again. It should download successfully. It's trying to do a large chain rollback and failing. Yeah, I built from source using kr105's repository and I can't even connect to anything. Yes, I'll try a chain download using this and see if it's on a fork. Has there been a chain fork? Vircurex shows the current block as 329,592. I did a full chain download using the i0coin.bitparking.com client and it has the block count as greater than 330,000. What client is vircurex running? It sounds like those transactions got rolled back in the chain reorg. They will never confirm if so and will always remain. It's the same thing that happened when my original i0coin exchange got double spent. I think the vircurex exchange owner will need to check their exchange transactions to see if there are any 0 confirms stuck.kr105, is there anything in the new client that could be related to this? Or is it just a malicious rollback? Yeah not sure what the problem is yet. I see someone released an i0coin client recently. I'm wondering if there's some incompatibilty between that and the original. There's a problem with i0coin causing the daemon to crash. It looks like a large rollback or something to that effect. It was affecting the merge mining of the other coins. I've disabled i0coin for now until it's resolved. I notice the hash rate of the i0coin chain has plummetted so I assume I'm not the only one with the issue. Anyone see a big chain rollback on i0coin today? I have two nodes that saw it and crashed due to out of memory from the reorg.  It's not fixed, it's just dependent on hash rate. Unfortunately the incident with CoiledCoin shows the a major player can still disrupt an alternate coin. As far as I know the biggest miner on i0coin, with >50% is still the coiledcoin attacker.That said, there's an exchange for i0coin already - Vircurex. Why not just use that?It'd be nice to see some usage of the coin beyond exchange trading. I checked the exchange and the address doesn't belong to that wallet. Would you have used any of the other exchanges I ran? (i0coin, ixcoin, solidcoin, etc). I think they were running about that time. Update done. There will be a few minutes of downtime in the next hour or so as I upgrade the pools bitcoind. Stopping merge mining leads to the issue where merge mining was added in the first place - preventing people with lots of hash power double spending the exchanges.
Pool wallet is not dry. What error are you getting? Can you PM me your username and details? There was a bunch of evidence pointing to a particular person. One of the moon threads has it. This included MrMoon and this person logging onto IRC with the same IP address and various other things. i0coin halved a few months ago. The subsidy cuts in half every 218,750 blocks. The pool runs a small online wallet to reduce losses if it gets hacked. That's currently been used up and I'm in the process of moving funds from the offline wallet. Withdrawal's should work once that's done.  I'm currently traveling in an area with very slow internet access and it's proving extremely difficult to keep the bitcoin blockchain up to date to do transfers from the offline wallet. Once I'm back home things will go back to normal. Yeah, same issue. Pool online funds went dry and it took a few blocks to transfer from the offline wallet. Did you backout the changes that result in blockchain forks? The BIP16 and BIP30 stuff? Or change the dates when these activate? If not, the majority of miners will need to be using your client, or problems may occur (anyone being able to redeem BIP16 transactions, working on an orphaned fork, etc).  Yeah, pretty amazing! What platform? The i0coin running on my pool has never died. You may be running out of memory of you're running on a low memory VPS. My daemon is using about 600MB of memory or so. With https://vircurex.com/ operating I don't think there's any need for it given the low level of use of i0coin at the moment. If it started getting used for other things I might get tempted. Haha, I wish. It's not my own yacht, part of a charter tour to the island :-) I don't know. In a week I'm on a yacht sailing to a remote pacific island and will only have expensive low speed satellite internet if I'm lucky. I won't be making any changes before then as I won't be able to fix it until I get back. So not before early May. Interesting test for bitcoin - how do you use it with patchy internet. I'd hoped to get it done before the trip but have had too much other things to do beforehand. I haven't had a chance, sorry. Feel free to grab the source from github, change the images, and build yourself if you want to move things along. Try again after the next bitcoin block is found (ie. block 173330). Funds are being transferred from the offline wallet to the pool - once that's processed you can withdraw. Thanks for the images lightlord, I'll do a build over the weekend using them and see how it goes. Withdrawals are enabled again.  Withdrawal facility is down for maintenance. It'll be re-enabled in 12 hours or so, if not sooner. luke-jr stopped dumping all his i0coins that he gets from his pool onto the market?I've not seen the logo's in .xpm format which is what is needed for including in the client. Basically someone needs to provide replacements for the existing .xpm files using the i0coin logo. There was a few minutes downtime today while I updated the pool to support BIP's 16 and 30. I think it's the mining and fast blocks of i0coin that causes the larger stales. I've temporarily disabled i0coin block notification so there will be less long polling and see if that makes a difference for a day or two. I'll payout stales on i0coin out of the pool's funds so users won't lose out due to this temporary change. There are issues with "Withdraw all" which is why it's disabled. I'll re-enable it when I've worked out a good fix for it. Thanks for using the pool! What happens if the majority mining power doesn't update? Or the majority of clients?
You can run the actual bitcoind binary on the n900: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2125.0 Your version of miniupnp is incorrect. What version do you have installed? Try upgrading to the latest version. This is ancient. See tiker's response for the correct location. Bitcoin developers were actively against storing data in the blockchain. Or is the name data you are proposing stored elsewhere? Mike Hearn outlined an approach for doing merge mining using naming as the example where it doesn't use its own blockchain if you're interested. And block 218,750 has been hit. i0coin now pays 24 coins per block. It halves at 218,750. The hash rate is less than that. Notice the block count for i0coin on allchains.info. It appears to be stuck. It looks like mmpool is the main chain miner at the moment. The generation amount for i0coin drops from 48 to 24 in less than 100 blocks btw. I don't know why you'd be getting high rejects, unless you're ignoring long polling. What do you mea nby "too much work rolling"? There is only one developer and as far as I know they haven't responded to you yet - I don't know if that's an indication of being uncomfortable or not. You've been appealing to 'khal', but the namecoin developer is vinced. Have you looked through the namecoin thread to see if there's any reasoning? According to Gavin they can become isolated if someone mines a bad transaction. Is it a temporary isolation (duration only for that block)? Or was that issue fixed? explorer.devcoin.org has been dead for a while - is it going to be fixed or replaced? The advantage for those on a PPS pool - you get paid the full amount per share even though the actual block values were less. Bad luck for the pool though! Ask in the dot-bit.org forums. Khalahan there just went through the process on their own wallet. I put windows  binaries here: ...they're now available at dot-bit.org...They should appear on the dot-bit.org site at some point. I helped contribute to the solution, along with khalahan from dot-bit.org. Send coins to to their donate address at the bottom of this page as they did a lot of the work to get the github repository updated and linux binaries, etc. Only 18,000 blocks or so until the subsidy is cut in half to 24 coins per block. Try the latest namecoin client at https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin. Linux binary on http://dot-bit.org/Main_Page. You want version 0.3.24.66. This contains patches to help with wallets full of the dust spam transactions that have been happening. They are drafts but it's feedback from implementers (ie. people like you) that will help decide whether they're final. If you implement it, it'll no doubt become the final spec for namecoin/i2p integration. The usual way to lookup a single name is "name_scan" with the numeric argument set to 1. eg:Code:namecoind name_scan d/bluishcoder 1[    {        "name" : "d/bluishcoder",        "value" : "{\"map\":{\"\":\"69.164.206.88\"}}",        "txid" : "ebad6e9dfcb8d1204a49a6da089f6a102ea5779612c745d94766153215bc9a3f",        "expires_in" : 27317    }]You need to check if the returned name is the same as the one you asked for. If it is, and expires_in is greater than 0 you have the right record. Another approach is to monitor the namecoin network for blocks. When you get one do a "name_scan" to obtain the complete history. Cache that and do fast lookups using it. Whenever a new block arrives invalidate the cache and repopulate it. Not that I've noticed, it's working fine for me. Is it still happening for you? The namecoin chain is currently being spammed with dust. If you look at the block explorer the blocks have all been maximum size recently. There was discussion on IRC and the dot-bit forums about it.
A quick search produced no information on these coins with regards to where to get source, clients, how merge mining capable they are (chain id's etc). Do you have any further details? Where are they used? Thanks, I'll do some work on longpolling efficiency. Part of the problem is longpolls are so often with the number of chains being mined.Is there any interest in additional user stats? If so, what sort of stats? Or a leaderboard of users?  Are you still getting them or was it just for a short period of time? What does cgminer say the longpoll URL is? Try the http://mmrpc.bitparking.com:80/ URL for the miner - that uses a port 80 longpoller too and may help identify if it is a firewall issue. They proved they were the owner of an address that was used to mine a large number of LTC coins, associated with a large miner in this thread.Without source it'd be difficult to "shutdown" RealCoin since you have to use their close source binary to mine. You can't modify it to do a "Luke-Jr attack" where you use your >51% power to reject all blocks but your own, or to double spend. You can mine most of the coins of course and cause difficulty that way though. Pool is back up now. There appears to have been a kernel panic that shut it down as a result of something namecoind related. I'm looking into it what caused that. Pool is back up now. There appears to have been a kernel panic that shut it down as a result of something namecoind related. I'm looking into it. Down for me too. Waiting to hear back from the company hosting the machine. btc is only able to be used as a 'parent' chain. It can't be an auxiliary chain. It requires a block chain fork for a chain to be changed to support use as an auxiliary chain. I tried this briefly with mmpool to see how it would work. Unfortunately 10 second longpolls means every user of the mmpool would be constantly longpolling. Many would probably not get the longpoll message before another one went out. Without sending the longpoll to users (ie. trying to hide the fact that p2pool was being used) would result in a large number of stales. Block 162209 is shown as P2Pool but it was the bitparking mmpool. You can confirm this with the IP you have being that of the mmpool server. There's a few others with that IP shown as P2Pool as well. P2Pool as a 10 second share time doesn't it? If this means a traditional pool would have to expose 10 second longpolls to its clients I don't think it'd work very well. You have to register a new name, and enter our addresses along with a devcoin address. If you use the same addresses for the other coins as the old account I'll, at some point, combine the values so you won't lose 'dust' in the old account. Hopefully I'll have that implemented some time this weekend. I find this pretty scary. It may be "worse case" but when worse case happens by someone mining a single block and the result is a drop in the network hash rate by almost 50% and people lose money, that seems non-optimal. Depending on the make up of the pools that support it it could push one of them over 50%. Note that I'm not opposing the new feature being introduced, I'm concerned about the bad things that seem possible when it happens. Would it be possible to push out a client first that activates some far time in the future at a particular block number when it's expected a larger number of clients would have updated.  You're right, it's unlikely anyone will accidentally do it. But I can guarantee there are malicious people around just itching to cause a bit of havoc in bitcoin. It would be best to plan for the case of "it will happen that someone will mine a block" rather than "I don't think anyone would waste time to". There was no attack that I'm aware of from BTCGuild or anyone on i0c other than the double spend attack on the exchange much later in the chains history. Whoever did that is a mystery, other than knowing the i0coin addresses that hold the funds. i0coin's issue was broken difficulty adjustment code that used 'real world' time. ArtForZ actually provided the fix for this so the chain could continue. mmpool has 70 Ghash mining i0coin. Transactions are going through and blocks are being processed so the chain is not dead. This is different from CLC whereby Luke was not allowing any other blocks at all. Unfortunately removing MM results in the chain getting owned by someone else when the hash rate drops. Another fun idea is to make mining blocks cost coins, rather than gain them. Eventually the merge miners will run out of money and can't mine blocks anymore. Solving the problem of no one wanting to mine at that point is an exercise for the reader  Yes, it's a good idea. Currently I adjust balances immediately on receiving a share so can't identify earnings in a 24 hour period easily. I can show number of shares in a 24 hour period without too much difficulty since I already keep that information. I'll look at adding the earnings feature though.  Do nodes automagically update to these? Or is some manual work required? Mining is available on port 80 (standard HTTP port) by using the server mmrpc.bitparking.com. So instead of using http://mmpool.bitparking.com:15098, just use http://mmrpc.bitparking.com. This is slightly less efficient than the 15098 port in that internally it redirects to that but it shouldn't be noticeable.
Can't you change the wallet used by your pool? mmpool has mined a few. It gets about 15-20 out of the 120 immature generations. I assume most of the rest is Eligius. I've adjusted the fees for the pool based on current stale and orphan rates down to 2.5% for all coins. Previously it was 5% for bitcoin/namecoin/devcoin and 7.5% for i0coin and ixcoin. Current PPS rates are:bitcoin 0.00003898devcoin 0.08386213i0coin   0.00844560ixcoin 0.00344397namecoin 0.00010509Note these change based on difficulty so check mmpool for the up to date rates. I've adjusted the fees for the pool based on current stale and orphan rates down to 2.5%. Previously it was 5% for bitcoin/namecoin/devcoin and 7.5% for i0coin and ixcoin. mmpool doesn't allow changing of addresses at all. You have to re-register with new addresses. Registration is light weight in that you only need a username, no password or email address, so it's not too much of a burden. I did it this way to avoid the "hack account, change address" which seems to occur occasionally in places. You could consider making the link to vircurex one without a referral id and follow it with something like "and if you use this link, you get reduced trading fees" or something. It'd look less spammy.  Devcoin's difficulty adjusts fast! 41,945 and rising. Websites can go down or be DOS'd. I used the P2P messaging to avoid this, but if that isn't important then yes, a website URL is an option.  There's a thread someone started for this but I can't edit it for hash rate or features so I've started this one. The Bitparking Merged Mining Pool mines Bitcoin, Namecoin. IXcoin and Devcoin.

I've kept everything deliberately sparse. Coin addresses can't be edited once created (by design) but you can register a new username anytime with new addresses.

Change '8' to any number less than 60,000.  One of the issues with low hash rate chains is dealing with having to add checkpoints regularly and getting users to upgrade to keep the network secure. Here's a work-in-progress proof of concept of 'dynamic checkpoints': https://github.com/doublec/i0coin/tree/dynamic_checkpointsThis provides the ability for a trusted entity with a key to send a checkpoint out to nodes. These 'checkpoint' messages are passed to all nodes. Nodes that are operating in 'trust' mode will check the signature on the message and if it is from the trusted entity it will install the checkpoint. No need to upgrade the software.The patch provides:- All nodes relay the "checkpoint" messages- Only nodes with the "-trust" command line argument will check the signature and install the checkpoint- Nodes can add "-trustkey=foo" arguments where "foo" is an address to override the default key and trust some other entity for checkpoints- a JSON-RPC command to sign and send checkpoint messages- Only checkpoints higher than existing checkpoints can be added so no chain rollback can be done.At least the following should be added:- a JSON-RPC command to return the latest checkpoint. Nodes like exchanges could use this to know for certain a chain won't rollback past a point. This could be used to feel confident to accept large deposits.- Flood control to deal with "checkpoint" messages being sent aroundThoughts on this model? it centralizes the aspect of checkpoints but provides the ability for nodes to override. And isn't different to a trusted developer releasing versions with checkpoints. Maybe only have it enabled when the chain hash rate is low?Note the patch is an experiment and shouldn't be used in production right now. CLC is dead - I'm no longer allowing addresses to be registered. I paid out all existing CLC shares at a BTC rate of 0.0002 per CLC. What I posted just means it's likely Eligius is mining alternate chains, nothing more. It could just be namecoin for example with weird merkle tree sizing. Someone more motivated would have to dig further into the chains if they wanted to find anything else out. Ok, thanks. If it becomes an issue I'll do zero fee and have my pool take those transactions. It can be shown that the Eligius pool is likely multiple block chains by looking at the coinbase of the generated bitcoin transactions. Here's a coinbase from an Eligius  bitcoin block that was used for namecoin only merge mining:Code:Block 160257  coinbase: 07456c696769757302660c2c4d4d3d3d4976cbf9003c0705e29e581038d3ddbe260a5d324c2b17b24779b6ca48c4f8320100000000000000074f505f4556414cThe details of the coinbase are available in the merged mining specification. From this you can see that the number of entries in the aux merkle tree is 1. This means up to 1 other chain is being mined. That's probably namecoin. You can look up the hash of the namecoin block. It's hash 4976cbf9003c0705e29e581038d3ddbe260a5d324c2b17b24779b6ca48c4f832 or  block 36067.Now look at a slightly later block. Say 160499:Code:Block 160499:  coinbase 07456c6967697573025b252cfabe6d6dd28f2fe3e45981bb5ede1a627d762c620847f088cca62d45e6e91f3222ca48b60400000000000000074f505f4556414cThe aux merkle tree size is 4. So up to four other alt chains are being mined. Why the increase if it's only namecoin being mined? Also note that the hash in the coinbase no longer corresponds to a namecoin block. This is another sign multiple chains are being mined. This is during the period that i0coin and ixcoin hash rates increased.Now a more recent block:Code:Block 161090:  coinbase 07456c696769757302a6572cfabe6d6db1e2cb4f9537ecca37a59867856aba5c856992564a80918def0b965174d19a880800000000000000The aux merkle tree size here is 8. Why the increase? Coiled Coin and Devcoin are both active at this time and would have required the aux merkle size to be upped. I got the Eligius found blocks from here. Pools payout the total generation amount based on shares submitted. So people with lower hash rates get lower amounts. With mmpool it's PPS so they get (at the moment) 0.29 devcoins per share or so. Any thoughts on how to deal with fees for devcoin withdrawals in pools? Looks like I'll have to set a much larger minimum withdrawal for devcoin since I can't judge how much the fees are. I'm getting people withdrawing 2 devcoin and I'm paying a 6 devcoin fee for it. What address was this sent to for me? I haven't received this or the recent devcoin bounty you sent in the address I thought I was using.edit: disregard, I received them now. Devcoin merge mining is active at bitparking now. Devcoin merge mining is active on bitparking now. You can use a bitcoin address created from your own bitcoin wallet. Use that in the devcoin address field. At some later time when you want to claim the devcoin's you can import the private key for the address from bitcoin into devcoin. Their addresses are the same format.
Oh right. What's happening is those are blocks mined by someone else, but you are the recipient of the 45,000 share for that block. If you look at the block in the explorer it'll be your own devcoin address from the receivers.csv there. They appear as generates and are still immature. I guess that has the potential to confuse your pool somewhat, assuming that's devcoind output from your pool's daemon. Yeah, something's wrong. those block amounts don't seem right. Are you sure you're not on a fork? Check your hash against: http://64.244.102.88:2750/block/0000000000008dad8f4ae8910a759b81de4e9f84bcb74d75ad6052ef4d77dac7 Why are you asking me if I have plans to merge mine currencies I'm already merge mining? Try mmrpc.bitparking.com, port 80. I've just set this up now so it may take a bit for the dns to propogate. Let me know how it goes. That port is for miners only and forwards internally to port 15098 so may be slightly less efficient due to that additional latency. Email me at the address on the mmpool site. Below I'm explaining what an attacker could do with an attack similar to what happen with coiledcoin. I'm not suggesting this will actually happen.Assume it's a pool with 350 or more Ghash. You can personally summon that much mining power to complete? You'd actually need to exceed what they have.They don't need to invest money - it's free by merge mining bitcoins at the same time. There is no additional cost for a large miner to attack it. Changing difficulty doesn't matter. If they have >51% they then stop accepting other peoples blocks and continue to publish their chain containing only their blocks. Now they control what transactions can be included. If they stop allowing any transactions the chain is dead. No blocks and no transactions. And it's not costing the attacker anything - they're still earning bitcoins/namecoins/whatever while doing it. The only defence is to exceed their hash rate. Or to somehow identify and stop their blocks.The coiled coin attack has shown how hard it will be for alt chains to survive without the good will of existing pools. it can "break" the currency if the miner has greater than 51% and refuses to accept other miners blocks and refuses to include any transactions. Because they have >51% they always have the longest chain. No one else gets blocks, no transactions are allowed, so the chain is effectively dead. It's a pretty nifty example of the power of >51% hash rate. Because he warned me he would. By attack I mean mine the chain with a huge hashrate, dump the coins and drive the price down as is happening with i0/ixcoin. Whether he still plans to or not I don't know. Since it's actually happening on other chains it's important to be prepared for it. My warning about 51% attacks is due to what happen to coiled coin. I don't know if he plans to do the same with devcoin but since it's happened to an existing chain it's important to have a plan for dealing with it. You don't want to find 2 hours into merge mining enabled that your chain is dead. Even if the plan is to ask him if he'll please not do it. No worries, it's all a learning experience. I guess that will be the last alt chain for a while. No, they are normal transactions. It looks like a lot due to the amounts being smallish but coming from addresses with large amounts and the change being the remaining large amount. As far as I'm aware Luke hasn't attacked devcoin. All users that mined coiled coins on the mmpool have been compensated BTC at the rate of 0.0002 btc per coiled coin. This has been credited to your bitcoin balance. Sorry for the inconvenience of resetting your addresses for such a short lived chain.  Which information exactly? You can read the curledcoin thread for details on what happened there.  That's a pretty uncalled for comment. [thanks for removing the barb]. The only thing I know Luke-Jr to be doing with i0coin/ixcoin is mining them and selling them with the intent to crash the price . I know this because Luke told me in #namecoin IRC. [logs removed due to objection from luke]. I don't know anything about the bitparking pool clams. Luke has definitely not done anything to bitparking. Please don't try to make it look like that situation was the same as the one here. I ran a stock standard pool that did nothing to change block propagation in any way. The situation here is a majority pool actively refusing other blocks and this is not the same.  I'm not sure what you're getting at. All I'm doing is giving advance warning that when merge mining activates you'll have a hostile pool with large hash rate destroying your chain. I'm not arguing about whether such a thing is moral or legal or anything. I'm just saying, you might want to be prepared. Like find 300 Ghash somewhere. https://github.com/makomk/coiledcoin The pool is still mining, it'll just never get any blocks unless luke's pool gets below 50%. Sure, but finding 300 Ghash of power to compete with his pool might be difficult. Do his users support him? I doubt they care. Given that luke-jr seems to be on a crusade to destroy merge minable alternate chains (he recently attacked the coiledcoin chain), what plans does devcoin have to prevent this when it switches on?
Due to an attack on the coiledcoin chain by luke-jr I've stopped merge mining them. I'll continue to accept deposit addresses in case it can be re-enabled in the future. What chain Id are you using for groupcoin? I've had to temporarily disable the "Withdraw All" button on the user balance page. You can still withdraw the currencies individually using their own buttons. Once I've resolved the issue with "Withdraw All" I'll re-enable the functionality. I've stopped sending out longpoll notifications for coiledcoin, so there will be less now. It'll mean more stales for the pool but I'll absorb it, and pay out the shares for it, for a while until the difficulty gets a bit higher. Hopefully the difficulty will increase to a point where that becomes less of an issue soon. There was a glitch when the pool had coiled coin added to merge mine. I'm looking into why it happened but it's up again. Looks like the addition of the extra coin caused issues. I've tweaked some things and we'll see how that goes. Merge mining is now active for coiled coins and the pool is paying shares for it. I've added the ability to have a Coiled Coin address when registering. Those that register with this new coin can start receiving them when/if the pool starts merge mining them. You can register accounts with Coiled Coin addresses at mmpool and they'll start receiving coins once I've tested and enabled it. It's receiver pays for fees too isn't it? Or did I misread somewhere? It sounds unlikely. At 24,660 blocks, 50,000 coins per block, that's 1.233  billion coins in circulation. Do:Code:[url=http://example.com/somewhere]This is the text[/url] I'm currently MMing BTC, NMC, IXC and I0C. DVC isn't merge mineable yet but I'm planning to enable it when it is to see how it goes. You'll have to ask Eligius what exactly they're merge mining. Thanks :-D I'm hoping it gets more users too. The problem is that if you set up a service that uses an alt-coin, you could get more users by opening it up to bitcoin. Alt coins need to provide something that bitcoin doesn't. Namecoin has names. Perhaps additional transaction types, or other experimental offerings. The 502 was because of crashes happening due to issues with the new backend. I've hopefully stomped on all them now. You can keep the 1.34 BTC as reward for testing  I've made some changes to the pool backend to try and improve getwork throughput when longpolling is informing users of a found block. Previously the pool would slow down as it suffered a 'thundering herd' of users asking for work for a few seconds. Hopefully this impact is reduced now. If you see any problems post here, PM or email. If you've been getting messages from your miner about the pool not being able to provide work fast enough I'd be interested in knowing if the frequency of this has reduced or increased. Maybe he's not merged mining 100% of the pool? In IRC he didn't actually mention it was Eligius, he said he was MM. I assumed it was Eligius as I thought that was his only access to that hash power, so possibly it's something else. Or he's joking around which wouldn't be the first time! luke-jr has said on irc that he plans to merge mine devcoins when block 25,000 comes around on his eligius pool. From the conversation I think the plan is to mine and sell them immediately so expect interesting changes in the devcoin value at that point. He's currently doing this with i0coin and ixcoin which is why their hash rate has jumped hugely. luke-jr confirms it's his pool (eligius) that's doing the merged mining of ixcoin and i0coin on irc.
Looks like it. They're mining i0coin and ixcoin from the looks of it since the latter also has a high hash rate. What miner (and version of that miner) are you using? I was running another process on the pool server for a while which impacted performance quite a bit until I noticed and killed it. This may be a reason for increasing stales today. Now that merge mining is working, do I get the second half of the bounty? This is my understanding, yes. I see. It seems to cycle through addresses from the receiver.csv file each block. When a miner solves a  block, 50,000 devcoins are created. Of these, 5,000 goes to the miner. Where do the other 45,000 go? My understanding is they go to 'developers' as a donation. How is this distributed? Do miners create the transactions to send the coins to them as part of minting the block? Or do the coins go to an address and an administrator periodically sends them out? ixc seems to have stopped updating. ixcoind crashed? http://blockexplorer.sytes.net/ usually works. I've bumped the dev's thread. Some of the chains seem to be stuck. i0coin and ixcoin for example. Are you interested in doing a devcoin block explorer? I believe that's how it's done, yes. Yes, I probably have - I erred on the side of caution in the renaming. I'll do a GUI build and fix it up at some point. Isn't cURL fun! You need to either build libidn for 64 bit, or configure curl using "--without-libidn". ixcoin has reached block 45,000 and mmpool is now merge mining ixcoins along with bitcoin, namecoin and i0coin.  Block 45,000 is reached and mmpool is now merge mining ixcoins. Build libcurl without ldap support. There's a configure option for it. Otherwise it's a pain - you have to build ldap libraries and link to them. The latest bitcoin source includes a patch to import and export private keys. I'll cherry-pick that patch into my devcoin repository to make it easier. So it shouldn't be too difficult. I'll do some testing. These link errors are due to devcoind requiring libcurl - something none of the other alt chains use. You'll need to build libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) and and change the 'LIBS' line in the makefile.osx to:Code:LIBS= -dead_strip \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libdb_cxx-4.8.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_system.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_filesystem.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_program_options.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_thread.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libssl.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libcrypto.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libcurl.aNote that libcurl.a addition at the end. Let me know if this works ok and I'll push a fix to the repository with this. Thanks SAC, looking at it now. I've added the ability to register with a devcoin address to the mmpool now. See here for details. I'm thinking of automatically setting existing users devcoin address to their bitcoin address since they are compatible. Then users can mine devcoins without re-registering and import their private key if they want to claim them. I've added the ability to include a devcoin address when registering. Devcoin merge mining turns on at block 25,000 (currently it's at block 23,874). I don't know if I'll enable it on the pool yet, but if I do and you want devcoins you can re-register and include a devcoin address. Note that bitcoin addresses are valid devcoin addresses so for all existing registered users I can set the devcoin address to their bitcoin address. Then if you want to claim your share you can import the private key from bitcoin into devcoin.At this stage I'm thinking of enabling merge mining for devcoin, and monitor the effect. If it causes an increase in stales or other issues I'll disable it until my work on reducing pool stales is done then re-enable it. I'm working on improving the stale count and delivery of work so hopefully this will improve from the pool end soon. 
Can you paste or PM me the command line you are using? The username is case sensitive so make sure that is right. Makefiles are changed to produce the correct binary name and use of 'bitcoin' in the app itself has changed to 'devcoin'. I modified the other OS makefiles but haven't been able to test them. Let me know if OS X fails and I'll fix. I'll test Windows later today. At some point, yes. I'll announce when it's available to register with a devcoin address.  There's a way to avoid this need to re-register using the message signing capability in recent clients but it requires a decent amount of programming changes to the pool. I'll look into doing that though to avoid the pain of re-registering.For those keen on trying it, I'm using my own devcoin daemon, built from https://github.com/doublec/devcoin, which is based on the original bitcoin release that devcoin was applied too, devcoin patch applied, and a bunch of cherry-picked bugfixes (the same as I applied to i0coin). Ok, thanks. I've upgraded my node at bitparking.com with the new code. Is the 25,000 switch on time 'official' now? Will there be an announcement for people to update nodes? We're at 23,770 as I'm writing this so it's not far off. I'd like to upgrade my node but don't want to do it if it's going to change. Are you going to add a checkpoint in the release? Namecoin doesn't have a gui and i0coin uses the older wxwidgets based GUI. I missed this, sorry. This means you're not actually mining devcoins at the moment. Your blocks will be created but then orphaned by the network as all the other nodes should reject them. You'll basically be mining your own fork of devcoin. What is the current hashrate of the entire devcoin network? Someone should ask allchains to support it, or provide an equivalent if possible. I'll probably add it to mmpool to see how it goes. That'll give it 30-40 Ghash/s. I have set up a permanent devcoin node running on bitparking.com (206.71.179.116) on the default port. Before the switch on block you can merge mine with devcoin as the parent chain and namecoin and/or i0coin as the auxiliary chains. The devcoin blocks solved here are valid for all clients. After block 25,000 (or whatever the decided switch on is) you can merge mine with bitcoin as the parent and devcoin as an auxiliary. Clients need to upgrade to accept the blocks produced in this configuration. Bitcoin as the parent with devcoin as an aux chain will need the block value changed in GetAuxPowStartBlock. You can make it INT_MAX for testing purposes which will allow merge mining. You should do that on a closed network only otherwise the blocks will be orphaned.For namecoin I use the current master branch. You are correct that it doesn't support coinbasing, no version of namecoin supports that - except for custom builds that I'm not aware of being publicly available. Why do you need coinbase? It is a number, not a bitfield. Incrementing should be fine. See the information in the merged mining specification for details of how it is used: It's in GetAuxPowStartBlock in main.cpp For testing, this describes the approach I used for creating test networks to try it out when doing the i0coin patch. If you don't already have it you should also include the time travel exploit fix. The latter is also a block forking change so you could activate it at the same block as the merge mining switch if needed. I take it this is with devcoin as the parent chain? That doesn't require a block chain split. For enabling merge mining as an auxiliary chain the code will need to have a switch on block for when the blockchain forks and all clients will need to update before then. In the source repository markm linked to the switch on block is 45,000. I assume that's pulled directly from my merge mining patch for ixcoin. That'll need to be changed or you'll end up forking the chain. Make sure the chain id is also changed in the GetOurChainID function. Currently 0, 1, 2 and 3 are used that I know of. If you want to merge mine with the other chains it'll need to be different from that. Yes, I offered to do it a while back which is where the "where's the source code repository" came from. Note that it's not a 120 BTC bounty for the developer doing merged mining. There's 40 BTC for the developer, 40 BTC for someone who prepares the release and 40 BTC for a pool - I assume that's the first pool that merge mines with it. All the namecoin changes are isolated in the namecoin hooks class though. This allows building both bitcoin and namecoin from the same source IIRC. No, namecoin can't pull bitcoin changes - merging would be involved. This is due to the changes made to add the hooks in the first place. Additionally the change to Qt was fairly invasive and causes merge issues.For alt coins I prefer the process of reviewing and cherry picking patches/commits from bitcoin so you can be sure you are understanding and getting exactly what you want. Note that the bitcoin master branch contains an experimental change called OP_EVAL that needs a lot of testing before being released. I'm sure the bitcoin devs would love an alt chain to be the guinea pig to test it out but I'm not sure devcoin users want to be that.The devcoin patch based on bitcoin that I extracted can be used to apply to a recent bitcoin release - or guide the manual changes necessary to be compatible with the existing devcoin chain.You could also consider basing it on the i0coin changes I made which is a wxwidgets-gui version of bitcoin with cherry-picked patches from the bitcoin tree. Namecoin already does this with the 'hooks' classes and files if you're interested. Yes, there are a lot of ways of doing it but I've decided with the pools I've run to make it minimal registration and passwords as possible. Even having to register to allow multiple addresses is more than I wanted but it was the easiest way of doing it at the time. It has upsides and downsides, all part of the fun of choosing which pool to go with.
I just registered one and it worked fine. PM me the name(s) you tried if you want me to investigate, and the error message you got. I can't allow adding an IXcoin address like that otherwise people can try and guess others names and add their own ixcoin address which can't be changed. The cost of me avoiding passwords on the site.I consider the names to be 'throwaway' so I don't think the burden of registering new ones occasionally to get new features is too great. At some point I'll have the 'dust' in old accounts automatically be sent to the relevant addresses so it won't be lost. I just need to work out the best way of doing that without paying fees for small amounts. I think it's early days for devcoin and it'll improve over time. Probably a good thing since it might avoid the hype/bust cycle of other coins. Yes, there was a discussion in the devcoin thread about it when I asked about source code repositories to contribute. I was keen at one point to implement merged mining in devcoin. But there turned out not to be a stable source repository for it and one of the official clients had an invalid checkpoint making downloading the block chain not possible. It looks difficult to contribute to as a result. If there were a stable repository, accepting pull requests, it'd be more likely to happen. Ixcoin is all set to go, just waiting for the chain switch on block. It'll be interesting to see how the extra coin will impact mining with the increase in long polls. I'll monitor that and decide whether to keep it or move it to another pool at that point. New users of mmpool can register now and add an ixcoin address. It'll be used when it is turned on. Current users will need to re-register under a different name to add an ixcoin address. I'll have to work out some way of dealing with 'dust' in old accounts. Fees for i0coin on the pool have dropped from 10% down to 5%, the same as bitcoin and namecoin, now. I'll monitor how that goes over the next day or two.  I'm not giving an estimate. Quicker if someone actually does the legwork and converts the files so all I have to do is build. My pool always seem to show higher stales with Phoenix, I'm not sure why. Namebit also saw the same thing with their pool software. The method the merge pool is using to handle longpolls combined with stale shares is a bit inefficient too (related to the merge mining proxy I'm using) - something I plan to improve on. Thanks, received! I'm working on it (for the client). I suck at graphics and am having issues. If anyone wants to prepare a patch it'd be much appreciated! I've released source and binaries for v32509 of i0coin. The only change is a checkpoint added at block 161,000 to give a checkpoint past the merged mining switch on point. Downloads are at http://i0coin.bitparking.com. The bitparking merged mining pool solved its first bitcoin and namecoin blocks recently so I can confirm that merge mining of the three chains (bitcoin, namecoin and i0coin) are working on the live networks. It worked in testing of course but it's nice to get confirmation that it works 'for real'. The merged mining pool found its first bitcoin block a few blocks ago, and its first namecoin block a few hours ago, so I can confirm that merge mining is working successfully. If anyone is using old versions of cgminer, please update to the latest version before using a merged mining pool like mmpool. The older versions don't always respond to the longpoll notifications from the pool. This was an optimisation used in cgminer but it breaks with merged mining. Notifications will occur when auxiliary chains have a new block but cgminer will think because the primary chain hasn't changed it can continue mining. You'll get higher numbers of stales with these cgminer versions. As mentioned in the main i0coin thread,  now that i0coin supports merged mining I've modified my existing pool software to merge mine Bitcoin, Namecoin, i0coin, IXcoin and Devcoin. Payment is 'Pay Per Share' rather than the proportional system used by my other bitparking pools. Details at http://mmpool.bitparking.com.There may be bugs in the i0coin merged mining implementation or the pool software so there may be a few ups and downs in the pool at this early stage as I stamp them out. Contact me via email (email is on the pool website) if you have questions/problems. I don't bother with 'official' testnets. I create my own isolated test networks by not connecting to irc, dns, etc and manually bring up nodes connected to each other. It makes it easier to control. http://mmpool.bitparking.com for those interested. Reusing the same namecoin address should be fine. As long as you have access to funds deposited in that address of course! To test merge mining I've put up http://mmpool.bitparking.com. This will merge mine btc, nmc and i0c as a PPS pool. You'll need to register a user id to use with your miner, and associate nmc/btc/i0c addresses with that userid. Once you've created a userid you can't change those addresses. You can leave an address blank to not mine that particular chain. Let me know any issues/suggestions. It's pretty basic, I'm in the midst of rewriting my pool software so this is a temporary hack with my old pool software. Block 160,000 passed so merge mining on i0coin is now possible.
It does not need to be more difficult. You can merge mine i0coin or ixcoin right now as the primary with namecoin as the auxiliary even though those coins have a lower difficulty for example. You are correct that someone can use a private chain as the primary, one that no one knows about. For a pool though I suspect most people are interested in merge mining with bitcoins and that can only be a primary chain so 'pools mining hidden chains' probably won't be an issue. Yes but if a pool advertises it is merge mining 3 coins, but is actually mining 4 then it will hard for people to notice there's a 4th one there since there is a signature in the coinbase transaction for the others. They'd have to try and match up that signature with all known merged coins. A pool could even merge mine on a primary chain it doesn't advertise. Say, merge mine ixcoin, namecoin and i0coin with an unknown primary chain (a new one, devcoin, or some other). I don't know how users could track down what primary chain the pool is using. Are you running any custom patches? What OS? The i0coind on my linux server running on my pool has never crashed or hung. The pool could not do LP's on ixcoin (or whatever they want to hide) blocks. They'll get more stales but it won't matter, they'll still get extra coins. What I'm trying to say is now that merge mining is out on lots of chains it's difficult to know if a pool is mining extra stuff on the side. Does it even matter if they are? How would you know a pool was doing it? They could do it in secret and you'd be none the wiser. This is incorrect. The checkpoint is checked during normal operation of a node as it receives blocks from peers - only if it receives a block for the height that matches the checkpoint of course. You may be thinking of the fact that if a checkpoint is introduced  but the hash is incorrect then existing nodes that are beyond that checkpoint continue to operate normally. This is because they don't re-validate the chain it already has. This is the issue the devcoin chain had with the invalid checkpoint that was introduced. If it were to receive a reorganisation that involved getting a  block at the height of the checkpoint then it would check it.  Seems to work, I've updated my nodes. I've also re-activated my ixcoin pool. Eventually i want to switch the pool to merge mine bitcoin/namecoin/ixcoin/i0coin when the chains become merge capable. Correct me if I'm wrong but for the node to have got the block in the first place to be able to rewind back to it during a reorganisation then the checkpoint has been checked for it. The checkpoints are checked during the normal process of receiving a block from a node, not just the initial download. The more nodes that upgrade the less risk there is of someone rewriting the blockchain back to the checkpoint in 7. Source and binaries for version v32508 of i0coin is now available at http://i0coin.bitparking.com. The only change is to add a checkpoint at block 155,000. I'm working on including the i0coin icons that were made by lightlord in the next version.  You should not be using the patches from my branch as they've not yet been pulled in by ixcoin's creator. There are pull requests for them but they'll have to change the block switchover numbers. If you do use my branch you'll be on a fork which I doubt anyone will contribute to. It's unfortunate that the ixcoin creator didn't action the pull requests after requesting patches and offering the bounty. I'm busy with other stuff for a day or two, but will take a look at what's involved in converting the images to what's needed for the client then.  I'll checkpoint at the same time. How do nodes know they've changed to get a new copy? Or do they try whenever a block is mined and they need to verify it? What do these receiver files do? Are nodes supposed to update to these new files or does it happen automatically? How can are node confirm that the files are valid - that the owner of one of the sites hasn't changed the file? 'nHeight' is the current block count. '>>=' is shift right and assign. Basically it divides the subsidy in half every 218,750 blocks. This isn't two years since i0coin has a different block rate time. It's about 230 days. I don't know if it's possible with existing versions of PoolservJ but it does work with the merged mining proxy so it should be. 30-ish Ghash/s IIRC Looks like i0coin got past 150,000 safely so it has the timetravel fix activated. Next step, 160,000 for merged mining. If you define bitcoin early adopters as those who mined in the first year then IXC has no late adopters... If I can get a patch, or files to replace the existing ones in the client in whatever format that uses, I'll do a build with those included.
Is there a block explorer for devcoin? I0coin is what I'm actively working on. Ixcoin I provided patches for the timetravel fix and the merged-mining implementation for the coin maintainer (switching on at 40,000 and 45,000 respectively). So far he's done nothing with them so I guess those won't be the actual switchover block times. Is there a git repository, based on the original bitcoin repository it was forked from? If not, do you know the commit id where it was forked? If not git do you have any version control repository?  ArtForZ didn't do Namecoin. 'vinced' did. I ported namecoin's merged mining support to i0coin and ixcoin recently. I could do the same for devcoin assuming it's similar. Is devcoin based on the standard bitcoin git repository? You need to be aware that it's a blockchain forking change though. It'd have to have a block number that it turns on and all clients would need to update. Those that don't will be on an incompatible fork of the chain.

Yep,thanks!  Or a native C miner and call it using the Android NDK. Version v32507 of i0coin is available. Source and windows binaries are included. Only minor changes but I wanted to get a recent checkpoint out:Added new hardcoded seed nodeAdd a checkpoint at block 142,900 I've uploaded the source to github for v32507 of i0coin. This adds a new hardcoded seed node and a checkpoint at block 142,900. I'll add windows binaries soon: https://github.com/doublec/i0coinEdit: Window's binaries are up: http://i0coin.bitparking.com Assuming you want to mine namecoins as well as i0coins. Get and run the latest namecoin daemon, 0.3.24.64. Get and run the latest i0coin daemon. Get the i0coin source. Inside the 'contrib' directory of the source there is a 'merged-mining 'merged-mining-proxy' python script. Run this with command line arguments like:Code:merged-mining-proxy -w 10332 -p http://user:password@127.0.0.1:7332 -x http://user:password@127.0.0.1:8332Replace 7332 and 8332 with the ports you are running the i0coin and namecoin JSON-RPC server on respectively (the above are the defaults). Replace 'user' and 'password' with the rpcuser and rpcpassword's used for the respective programs. Point your miner to http://127.0.0.1:10332 as the address to mine and use any username and password, they are ignored. Mining should then start. Block 40,000 is when the timetravel fix activates, 45,000 is when merged mining activates. Assuming the ixcoin developer keeps the same block numbers as I used in the patches. Probably best to make them larger now since there won't be time for people to get new clients. It's nothing to do with me - I just provided fixes for issues raised by the ixcoin developer to claim a bounty. Block 40,000 is getting close - if you're not going to release a client with the timetravel exploit fixed soon you'll need to change the block switch on time. Any timeline? Not yet, you have to wait for block 160,000 before that becomes possible. Currently only i0coin+namecoin (or other chain that has support as a auxiliary merged mining chain). I hope those of you mining i0coin at the moment are merge mining namecoin at the same time and making extra out of it. Namecoin difficulty is fairly high though so it's probably not a big deal. Merge mining pull request enabling support as an auxiliary chain at block 45,000: https://github.com/ixcoin/ixcoin/pull/5I tested mining bitcoin, namecoin, ixcoin and i0coin all at once, successfully getting blocks. This was on my own internal forks of the block chains so I could mine at low difficulty. I'd suggest doing your own tests too to be comfortable.If this is enough to claim the bounty my address is xo8Jj5XcebH6qZE8ndhvrJjferxjL885L6While testing I noticed the genesis block for the ixcoin testnet is invalid. it'd be great if you could generate a valid testnet genesis since it makes testing a bit easier. Merged mining:https://github.com/doublec/ixcoin/tree/mergedminingThis enables ixcoin as a primary chain on the main network. It is supported as an auxiliary chain on the testnet only. I'll do some testing then push another commit to enable it as an auxiliary on the main net at a certain block number. Then I'll do a pull request.Primary chain support is still useful though. It means you can mine ixcoin and namecoins together right now by building this branch as it's a non-forking change. Adds a checkpoint at block 36,500:https://github.com/doublec/ixcoin/tree/checkpoint_36500
I started working on backporting some fixes. There's a pull request for the timetravel exploit fix, switching on at block 40,000:https://github.com/doublec/ixcoin/tree/timetravelfix If you're a 51% attacker it isn't. Right, but pools with >51% aren't unusual in alt chain world. With the GPU chains anyway. I think people would have started complaining if a big pool was offline for 27 blocks though. btc-e.com has 550 BTC available for taking in their litecoin exchange. I think that's plenty for people to be tempted to steal.  I can backport the patches I did for i0coin to ixcoin pretty easily I suspect. This doesn't update to the bitcoin 0.5 codebase, but does the core bugfixes up to then. I didn't apply the upgrades to the client for the Qt UI for example. Most importantly it gives the timetravel fix and merge mining.If I do this and submit a github pull request is that sufficient? Not that I know of. Usually I scan the chains using a block explorer but this is inefficient. It's easy for a merchant to know if they check their 'listtransactions'. They'll see that there are now deposits that were once confirmed showing as having 0 confirmations. Looking up the address and/or transaction in the block explorer will show the problem. A 27 block reorg is definitely a scary sign but it can be done by accident. A pool or large miner become disconnected from the network and when the network goes up their blocks get released for example. I'd be more inclined to think attack however if there have been other reorgs. People accepting litecoin payments should check their 'listtransactions'. It's also wise to have their nodes detect a big reorg (ie. past their confirmation limit) and shut down until investigated. This is what I did on the i0coin exchange in the end to catch it. Hashrate fluctuating isn't a sign of a double spend attack. Reorgs are. What would be useful for all alt chains is a tool that analyses reorgs and shows transactions that are different from that and the main fork. This is still prone to issues with double spenders:1. Attacker starts mining a fork2. Attacker deposits i0coin3. On fork attacker does not include deposit from (2) but sends the same coins to another address they control.4. Attacker withdraws i0coin5. Attacker releases fork when it's stronger than the main chain.6. Exchange has now lost the deposit and the withdrawal.Given that the timetravel exploit hasn't been enabled (block 150,000) this is easy to pull off. A mitigation would be to ensure any withdrawal from a users account comes from the same coins as they used to deposit. Getting back to the topic, the vircurex exchange has announced i0coin support when block 160,000 is reached and hash power increases. Merge mining changes the cost equation somewhat though. Someone can mine bitcoin and this chain at no additional cost. If the chain creator can get a large miner or pool to merge mine it then there's less risk of a double spend attack. Before merge mining there was an opportunity cost in supporting these chain experiments. Not so much now. There's a flip side though. An attacker can mine a fork to double spend for free too since they can earn bitcoins at the same time. Instead of you getting a percentage how about have all 100k coins mined in the generation block. They're owned by you. An exchange is available immediately in some form whereby you place orders for those coins for whatever value you perceive them to have. They are therefore available by people willing to to buy them (with bitcoins, i0coind, or whatever). Your reward is this initial income, which is likely to start off low since no one is likely to want them until someone starts using them but could get bigger. It depends how much you ask for in the initial sales.Mining is done as normal for transactions and miners get a transaction fee which they can set to whatever they want. A chance to experiment to see what will happen when bitcoin has all its coins mined. How could the coder control what other exchanges and clients do? They can't force them to put a donation tab on their sites/programs. How do you deal with sites that don't do this? The fee is 0.1% of what? The transaction amount? That's huge. Solidcoin doesn't take a fee from transactions AFAIK. Or do you mean of the 20 coins mined per block only? markm posted about an open transactions based exchange for i0coin which I believe is available now. I don't know how it works though as I haven't tried it. As you say block 150,000 is getting close for the timetravel fix and merge mining at block 160,000. I'm open to suggestions for changes to the client if you have any. How would the coder get 5K without premining? And if they did premine that'd be 5% of the total money supply. You might want to start a new thread on it if you want to get interest and discussion. Why do the conf files for bitcoin/namecoin in the tutorial specify "rpcallowip=*". Doesn't this open the JSON-RPC port of the daemon for anyone to connect to? This gives access to 'sendtoaddress' and other commands for sending coins out of the wallet. Or am I missing something? Is there a tutorial or step by step example on how to get a client running and connecting to the server? How are you protecting against double spend attacks given the low hash rate and the fact that i0coin hasn't yet reached the block where the timetravel fix is enabled yet? i0coin can be merge mined with any other coin. It can be namecoin, bitcoin, or anything using the same hash algorithm. Each individual miner (or pool) can merge mine with whatever they want. it's not limited to one specific coin type. I gave namecoin as an example in the post you reference, not as 'this is the only coin you can merge mine with'. I hope that answers your question. Here's a fun feature included in the latest version of i0coin (32506) as a result of the patches I cherry-picked from the recent bitcoin releases. It's khal's patch to sign and verify messages using bitcoin addreses. If you're the owner of an address you can sign a message with the private key.  Anyone can verify the message is from you by calling 'verifymessage' passing it the address and the result of the sign operation. This is a way of confirming a message comes from someone controlling a particular address. Examples:Code:$ i0coind getnewaddressjMq8wkYNByEqBtcUo5CaWq2mrxuRgyVHWB$ i0coind signmessage jMq8wkYNByEqBtcUo5CaWq2mrxuRgyVHWB "Hello World"HL2fs5IirODMtZCCAF9Vqgz5ZPpcmqNWgy7cnl50OlkoYvOC7gLlIqD4Z3Acmuu+idOQoRRo2DmEl9z/MCnnR8Q=$ i0coind verifymessage jMq8wkYNByEqBtcUo5CaWq2mrxuRgyVHWB HL...MCnnR8Q= "Hello World"true$ i0coind verifymessage jMq8wkYNByEqBtcUo5CaWq2mrxuRgyVHWB HL...MCnnR8Q= "Hello"false$ i0coind verifymessage jaQ4X3vVN41TaYpicQx7YemmvJWoXEscwS HL...MCnnR8Q= "Hello World"falseThis has uses in having a signed contract in exchange for funds transfer. Or if someone claims ownership of an address (say to show how much money they have or to prove they committed some transfer) you can ask them to prove it by signing a message with the address.  Right, I'm sure one will come when block 150,000 or 160,000 ticks over if not before.
You will need to download the new build before block 150,000 if you are running older than 0.3.25.4, or block 160,000 if you are running 0.3.25.4 itself (this is reported as 32504 in the 'version' field of the 'getinfo' RPC call in the command line client. Latest version is 32506). I've released source and windows binaries for i0coin version 32506 at http://i0coin.bitparking.com/. This version  backports a bunch of fixes from recent bitcoin versions. The most important change however is it enables merged mining as a auxiliary chain on block 160,000. This is a required upgrade before block 160,000, otherwise you'll be left on the wrong side of a fork. This completes the set of bug fixes and merge mining enabling I set out to do so will hopefully be the last 'required upgrade', except for emergency bug fixes.Hopefully with merged mining, and a stronger hash rate, exchanges and merchants can have some confidence in the coin. I've tested merge mining bitcoin as the primary chain (using namecoin patches for getworkaux implementation), with i0coin and namecoin as auxiliary chains and all three chains merge mined producing blocks (on testnet for the chains). All nodes broadcast addresses, it's trivial to collect a list of most connectable nodes on the network. Even with IRC disabled. You can then test each of these for an open JSON-RPC port with the default password. It's possible people are actively doing that. It'd be interesting to analyse the two chains and see if any transactions were changed. Yes, I saw your request for a drop to the reward. I won't be changing i0coin since this changes the value of existing held coins. It would mean i0coin would effectively be a new coin with a large 'premine' given to people who mined previously. My plan was to fix i0coin bugs, implement merged mining, but leave the generation rate, transaction fees, and values as they are since they are what gives a coin variant its identity. Plus I'd like to avoid the claims of arbitrary changing of values by a 'coin dictator'.For ixcoin you should contact the coin creator with your idea of dropping the rate. If they agree I'd be willing to provide the patches, a pool, etc. I'd be interested in seeing what a slower generation coin does. Current coins seem to have more coins available than people need to use since their is very little non-trading usage of them. Since ixcoin already has a premine and a 'controller' it may not be so bad to change things.Now that merge mining exists a possibly better approach for these "lets change a coin's features" requests is to create a new chain starting with no premine with the new features. Merge mine it with existing coins. Provide an exchange to trade between new coin and old coin, and see how they go. If you have existing i0coins they will remain usable. This is not creating a new chain like SC 2 did to SC 1. It's operating from the existing blockchain. See my reply to a similar question. I haven't yet pushed the version that enables merged mining so it's unlikely that the chain will get any great amount of hash power until that goes through. I'll do that in a day or two, probably switching on at 160,000. I'm currently backporting a number of bitcoin bug fixes that have been done since the original i0coin was released.It's possible to do an exchange earlier with some form of auto-checkpointing mechanism but that centralizes things around the exchange somewhat (ie. the exchange has control of what blockchain is the 'real' fork). I would imagine most people would be against that. The bitparking i0coin exchange was the victim of a >51% attack on the chain whereby the attacker would deposit, trade for bitcoins and then release a fork of the chain with the deposit transaction invalidated. This is why I closed the exchange. The ixcoin exchange was never attacked (to my knowledge) but I closed it as well since it also had a low hash rate and could suffer a similar attack. From what I remember the  threatened attacks at the time were:Namecoin had a low hash rate. The attacker had >51% of the rate. use the 'timewarp/zeitgeist' exploit that ArtForZ discovered on the GeistGeld chain to mine blocks at low difficulty to obtain a large number of coins quickly.With >51% of the hash rate, rewrite the namecoin blockchain since there was no recent checkpoint at the time.The attacker claimed to know of an exploit involving merged mining that would enable them to 'leapfrog' checkpoints and rewrite the chain with a hash rate less than 50%. What version of wxWidgets are you using? 2.9,1 exhibits that problem I think. Try 2.9.2. Sent: f8a57d9b3c54c15ac3900b3ce56b0dbfa498cbc8289ee5436fc29acee83ef085 I pushed a fix to the git repository just now for this. Let me know if it works for you. Merged mining should work fine on Windows. Use the windows binaries from http://i0pool.bitparking.com and start i0coin.exe with the "-server" command line option, or run the non-gui version i0coind.exe instead. Install Python for windows and use that to run the merged mining proxy, same as the linux command to run it. Ok, I have a backup of the ixcoin bitparking bitcoin wallet - I'm downloading the blockchain now to see if that address exists and the coins arrived. Is 1Eks95X2LozPJSfY7Zi5DRT66vdE7mUzLt an address owned by you? It's the change address from the transaction and can send the 80 btc back to that. Please confirm if you own that address and I'll follow up if I own the 80 btc address. The ixcoin exchange closed, the server instance deleted, a month ago. The wallet no longer exists.  A new version, 32504, with source and windows binaries is available at http://i0coin.bitparking.com. This version has the following changes:* Add a checkpoint at block 131,130* Merge patch from bitcoin to fix issues with database writes in the presence of lots of transactions* Add merged mining support, ported from the namecoin implementationThe database writes patch fixes an issue that came up when the solidcoin 1 chain was under pressure from specially crafted transactions. I cherry-picked the bitcoin fix for the problem.The merged mining code pulls in the changes I made to enable merged mining. I haven't activated support for i0coin as an auxiliary chain yet as this requires forking the block chain. After a bit more testing I'll pick a block number to activate and provide another update. In the meantime you can test this on the testnet, or use it as a primary chain to mine namecoins at the same time on the main net. See this post for how to do that. I've updated the 'master' branch of github to version 32504 which includes the merged mining code. With this you can use i0coin as a primary merge mining chain. This allows mining namecoins and i0coins at the same time (namecoin as the auxiliary chain). Once it's been tested for a bit longer I'll enable a switch on block for support for i0coin as a auxiliary chain. That will enable mining bitcoins and i0coins at the same time. To mine i0coins and namecoins, make sure i0coind and namecoind are running (or the GUI versions with the 'server' option enabled). Now run 'merged-mine-proxy' from the 'contrib' subdirectory of the source like so:Code:$ contrib/merged-mine-proxy -w 9332 -p http://i0cuser:password@127.0.0.1:7332/ -x http://nmcuser:password@127.0.0.1:8332/Replace  the username and passwords with those from the namecoin and i0coin .conf files. Now point your miner to port 9332 with any username and password. Mining will start with i0coins and namecoins being mined at the same time. Output will look like:Code:# i0coin block found2011-11-24T09:13:04.598774,solve,1,0,00000000a94a6f99a4ff77dc5ec8cdda3567ac3674bbc1e7ceec8339083d0e86# i0coin and namecoin block found2011-11-24T09:13:04.598774,solve,1,1,00000000a94a6f99a4ff77dc5ec8cdda3567ac3674bbc1e7ceec8339083d0e86 Awesome, thanks, much appreciated! I will probably do something if another exchange doesn't. Whether it's the old exchange, or something a little different, I'm not sure yet. If it was the old exchange it'd require merge mining to be active, and for a healthy hash rate distribution.
Thanks!Bitcoin: 1NpNGkLxyWRHNeb9wvq2AATKWcEtsTRZsLi0coin: jWqLauZXfF3PVVZDhjNqZLZk7voG2CAofiSolidcoin: I don't run the solidcoin client so don't need this, thanks thoughWhen merged mining is activated it'll be on a fork of the main blockchain. This means your existing i0coins will be valid and will work. I'll do some more testing then look at having merge mining switch on at a set block number, similar to the way I've set the timetravel exploit fix to activate. Success! Block 130176 on the main i0coin chain is a block mined using merge mining. It mined a testnet block and a mainnet block. You can see the coinbase containing the extra data:Code:"coinbase" : "0445fe021c0131522cfabe6d6d02309d7a5cdf4eddf7773d0c40d7771f052bb0821b95885e229a226f5ed291060100000000000000" Anyone want to test merged mining with i0coin? I have a first cut at code, taken from the namecoin implementation, and a post explaining how to test it. I have the first attempt at merge mining support in the 'mergedmining' branch of the git repository. If anyone wants to test it I'd appreciate the feedback. On linux you can clone the repository and build with:Code:$ git clone git://github.com/doublec/i0coin.git$ cd i0coin$ git checkout -b mergemining origin/mergemining$ cd src$ make -f makefile.unix i0coindMerged mining is disabled on the production network but enabled on the test network. What I do is set up a 'test network in the box' approach. This allows running test nodes without connecting to the wider network. I run two nodes on i0coind testnet - these will be the 'secondary chain':First create directories to hold the chains. Node 1:Code:$ mkdir -p node1/testnet$ cat >node1/testnet/i0coin.confrpcpassword=node1rpcuser=node1daemon=1upnp=0rpcport=17001noirc=1port=18001Node 2:Code:$ mkdir -p node2/testnet$ cat >node2/testnet/i0coin.confrpcpassword=node2rpcuser=node2daemon=1upnp=0rpcport=17002noirc=1port=18002Now we need a primary chain node. You can use namecoin for this since it's merge mine enabled. You can also use production i0coind with the binary built above since it has the code to be a primary node enabled:Code:$ mkdir -p node3/testnet$ cat >node3/testnet/i0coin.confrpcpassword=node3rpcuser=node3daemon=1upnp=0rpcport=17003noirc=1port=18003Start the nodes:Code:$ i0coind -conf=/full/path/to/node1/testnet/i0coin.conf -datadir=/full/path/to/node1 -port=18001 -testnet $ i0coind -conf=/full/path/to/node2/testnet/i0coin.conf -datadir=/full/path/to/node2 -port=18002 -testnet -addnode=127.0.0.1:18001$ i0coind -conf=/full/path/to/node3/testnet/i0coin.conf -datadir=/full/path/to/node3 -port=18003You need the 'addnode' in the second node start so it connects to node1 to form a network. Also note that 'node3' is not a testnet node. And make sure 'i0coind' is the one built from the 'mergedmining' branch. You can check the status of the nodes with commands like:Code:$ i0coind -conf=/full/path/to/node1/testnet/i0coin.conf -datadir=/full/path/to/node1 -port=18001 -testnet getinfo$ i0coind -conf=/full/path/to/node2/testnet/i0coin.conf -datadir=/full/path/to/node2 -port=18002 -testnet listtransactionsNow run the merged mining proxy:Code:$ contrib/merged-mine-proxy -w 17004 -p http://node3:node3@127.0.0.1:17003/ -x http://node2:node2@127.0.0.1:17002/The merged-mine-proxy code is from namecoin and is in the 'contrib' subdirectory of the i0coind 'mergedmining' source. This proxy will listen on port 17004 which is where you should point your miners. For example, poclbm:Code:python poclbm.py -d 0 --user mm --pass mm --host localhost --port 17004 You can use any username/password. You should see output from the proxy when the miner finds a block like:Code:2011-11-24T09:13:04.598774,solve,0,1,00000000a94a6f99a4ff77dc5ec8cdda3567ac3674bbc1e7ceec8339083d0e86The "solve,0,1" means it solved the secondary chain (the i0coind testnet). It'd be "solve,1,1" if it solved the primary and secondary chain. Hopefully the above gives a start for people to test the code. When it's confident that it's stable we can set a block to enable it live. I built the following: http://i0coin.bitparking.com/i0coin-win32-bin-v32502.zipThat includes the 'i0coin.exe' for the GUI and 'i0coind.exe' for the command line tool. I've only lightly tested it, downloading the blockchain successfully. Backup your wallet before running! I was bored and got tired of reading "Please somebody fix i0coin" posts/emails. I made an attempt at fixing the following i0coin bugs:* Fix for the timetravel/zeitgeist exploit. This is a block-forking change meaning that all clients must upgrade to this version. To enable time to update it turns on at block 150,000.* Add a checkpoint at bock 127,360* Remove the list of bitcoin DNS seed nodes* Change the hardcoded i0coin seed nodes to the only active node I know of accepting connections* Remove the outdated windows binaries included in the archive* Changed the IRC code to use the lfnet server instead of freenodeSource (tarball and git repository) and details at http://i0coin.bitparking.com.

I saw BitcoinExpress had in his signature for a while that he purchased an ipad 2 with money obtained from an ixcoin double spend - I don't know what that was in regard to. I wouldn't open another ixcoin exchange (or any other low hash rate exchange) in their existing forms , unless I found some way of dealing with double-spends or improving the way existing exchanges work to reduce the risk. Have you ever mined in the bitparking pool? When I closed I automatically sent out remaining balances.  55,000 i0coins seem to have been moved from this address to jXHTbPFRrMua2RAMUkPNniThu1qAmP3eGt. Anyone transacted that many i0coins recently? Please quote the part where I said he was full of shit, thanks. It was a shot at you, not at BCX. You're the one that listed those claims, not BCX. Unless you're BCX of course. Indeed, I closed deposits/withdrawals due to the threat. I take threats seriously. No attack occurred though. I closed the other exchanges due to the double spend that happened. I'm not saying BCX didn't do the attack. I'm saying there's no evidence of him doing the attack. He's more than welcome to prove it if he wants by moving the double spend coins.  Please point out which of my statements you feel are untrue. BitcoinExpress claims one attack. The first was ArtForZ's. ArtForZ has claimed in public IRC channels that there is no evidence that BitcoinExpress did what he claims on the GG chain so the claim of even one sucessful attack here is dubious.There is no proof this was BitcoinExpress. He should move coins around if he wants to prove it was him.Rumours don't mean anything. I know of no one paying him off for the attack.This one I don't know about.Where is there evidence of tests for 51% attacks on these coins by BitcoinExpress?Again, no evidence it was BitcoinExpress. He can prove it by moving the coins out of the I0Coin address holding the double spent coins - by posting in advance the amount he plans to move.Basically he may or may not have done any of the above. There's no proof either way.  I didn't confirm the post was legit. I confirmed the poster was correct that bitcoinexpress corresponded with me under that name. I have no idea if the contents if the post are legit. Please change the title. I don't think this needs another thread.... Yes, I received emails from BitcoinExpress from a gmail address with the name "Justin Guss" in the past. The coins are apparently unspendable - the client is hardcoded not to allow spending from the premined supernode addresses. Where are you getting information about supernodes? Has source or a paper been released?
That would be 50% of the blocks, not 50% of the coins wouldn't it? The 1 difficulty even blocks are for less coins - they are the protection fund coins IIUC. You must be using a definition of fork that I'm familiar with. BCX claimed to be mining a fork and followed with "Some of you are on my fork I suspect.". The only way they could be on that fork and not the main chain is if there was a break in the network somewhere. Peers share their blocks so the fork will become the main chain if it has a greater sum of work. For BCX to have a fork with a greater sum of work than the main chain he'd have to someone stop that from being distributed to the other peers. In which case the "Some of you are on my fork" can't be true.It's certainly possible for blocks to be solved faster even while difficulty is increasing. All it requires is hash rate to increase faster than difficulty. This is happening on namecoin at the moment as merged miners come on board, drastically increasing the hash rate while difficulty increases are capped at 4x. One lesson learnt from the original i0coin, time based difficulty changes are a disaster. Multiple nodes disagreeing on the time resulting in block chain forks. Are you running the latest software version, 0.3.24.63? If so, you might not be connected to other 0.3.24.63 nodes. Try doing an add node to one:Code:namecoind -addnode=178.32.31.41That node is run but the dot-bit.org maintainer. I vouch. He's provided namecoin binaries for a while that work well. If they want to re-use those coins, short of rewriting the blockchain again, they'd have to pull them from that address. jLSn51oKE27uc9JJ74ccscyRdj3mnMTVAY appears to contain the coins that were used for double spending on the bitparking i0coin exchange. If you run an exchange and see a deposit coming from this address you know you're at risk from the double spender. The large number of namecoins moving was the bitparking pool closing down and paying out the remaining balances. The total amount moved is inflated due to the block chain explorers counting the 'change' address multiple times. I got this a lot in my alternate block chain exchanges as well. It's very frustrating. Try compiling without upnp:Code:make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP= i0coind There was generic discussion about approaches for exchanges to deal with low hash rates. I don't know if this means anyone is actually working on it beyond experimenting with ideas. Each running daemon takes quite a bit of memory. The more chains the site supports the more memory it'd need. The bitcoin daemon on one of my sites is 1GB of memory. The namecoin daemon is 400MB. I can't imagine how cramped it must be on allchains.info fitting all those chains. I'll donate some BTC if you keep ixc until the end of the month when my exchange closes completely. It's useful to see the hashrate to diagnose issues with withdrawals not going through. Are you using the escrow code from multicoin? Isn't that broken? There was a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about issues with it IIRC. What testing have you done on it? My idea doesn't cover multiple exchanges. It would only work with one. More thought would be needed to extend it to other exchanges if needed. This is what I meant by centralizing around the exchange. So for the 'one true exchange' idea I'd see one order book managing deposits, withdraws and orders. This is the entity doing the checkpointing. Perhaps other 'exchanges' use an API to access the order book and provide functionality on top.  Right, there are problems to resolve. But this is for the specific case of low hash rate chains. It's trust the central authority to provide lockins or have coins stolen by block chain rewriters. I don't see how an exchange sending out a signed transaction containing a checkpoint to nodes is any different from a coin creator regularly updating the client with a checkpoint and asking for clients to upgrade. The advantage with the former is it's automatic and nodes upgrade automatically. Right, this is what happened. If you want to centralize around the exchange one thought I posted in another thread is have the exchange broadcast to the network the checkpoint for blocks when it confirms a deposit to the exchange database. Nodes then accept this message as a 'lockin' checkpoint. Expanding this to multiple exchanges might be wanted but in the 'one true exchange' case it'd work. it's hard to answer this without more information. Are you saying your balance is lower than you thought? If so email admin@bitparking.com with details. Right, I'm throwing out ideas for low hash rate chains moreso than 'fix i0coin'. I agree about a confederacy of exchanges/pools. Maybe have some way of all nodes voting to accept the message? Currently a low number of nodes with large hash power have a big impact on what gets accepted on the network. It'd be nice to be able to move this to all nodes somehow.
What are thoughts on this possible fix for the issues of having an exchange safely operate in a low hash rate system. Centralize the block chain around the exchange. The exchange can broadcast a message, signed by a private key, that contains the latest checkpoint that the exchange wants to lock in. It broadcasts this message whenever it confirms a deposit (ie. a deposit reaches the number of confirmation blocks the exchange requires).  Nodes then automatically get updated with the block chain the exchange is using and refuse reorganizations beyond this check point. 95 from the looks of it.Code:-#define ADDRESSVERSION   ((unsigned char)(fTestNet ? 111 : 0))+#define ADDRESSVERSION   ((unsigned char)(fTestNet ? 95 : 95))  It is source but there is a .zip file included that contains windows binaries. What commit id was it forked from sacarlson/multicoin-exp originally? If I clone multicoin-exp and overlay the source from Tenebrix-daemon-exp then the diff I get shows it wasn't the master. For example multicoin-exp includes auxpow merged mining changes in src/db.cpp but Tenebrix-daemon-exp doesn't. Yeah it's very hard to see what bitcoin fixes are missing. The keystore thing shows at least one is. I see sacarlson/multicoin-exp doesn't have that fix either. There is a bug in keystore.cpp, AddKey. A 'return true' should be there. I assume this is missing from a bitcoin merge or some commit not pulled into whatever history the original fairbrix source came from. This is the bitcoin commit where it was fixed.What's the ancestry of the code? ie. What commits was it forked from in bitcoin or multicoin? It makes it hard to audit what changes were made when the history is broken. I notice you accept namecoins. What version of the namecoin client are you running? I'm just checking to see if you are running the latest client which switches on merged mining at block 19,200 to ensure you don't end up on the wrong side of a chain fork.How are you handling the issue whereby namecoin has a small hash rate and an attacker with >51% of the network can effectively deposit namecoins, trade for bitcoins, withdraw the bitcoins, then reverse the deposit? This doesn't work in the presence of a >51% attacker either. This is one example of how an attack works:1) Start mining from the current block but don't publish the blocks to the network.2) Make a deposit.3) Don't include your deposit transaction in the fork you are mining in (1) but include all others.4) When the deposit clears trade for bitcoins.5) Withdraw bitcoins.6) When the bitcoin withdraw succeeds, publish your forked chain.7) Since the new fork doesn't include your deposit you can repeat from (1) re-using the coins in the transaction you didn't include in the fork.It doesn't matter how long I delay the withdrawal in (5) since they can wait as long as needed before doing (6). The only thing that upsets their plans is if the network hash rate increases and their fork is no longer the winning fork. But that's still no loss to them since they still have the bitcoins. They can buy more alternate coins and repeat until they succeed. This attack can easily be automated.This is difficult to spot for exchanges unless they're monitoring chain reorg's and then check all transactions in the new chain. Even then it's too late and the bitcoins are gone and can't be recovered. If the exchange doesn't notice then at some point they run out of bitcoins and wonder why. The I0Coin exchange was monitoring chain reorg's but unfortunately I didn't catch on to what was happening until the 4th attempt or so due to me traveling and not being able to analyze it in detail.Tying an exchange user to a verified identity would help since then the exchange user has to come up with verified identities to keep cheating the system, assuming the exchange bans accounts when it notices missing transactions after a chain reorg. Something like https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_5:_Trading_across_chains https://github.com/fusebox/i0coin Yes, this is the issue with IP banning. I used to IP ban people with suspicious activity but they just moved to TOR. The people who did the double spend used TOR. This won't work if someone has the majority of hash power. They can always rewrite the chain, they just need to wait. The higher confirmation just makes it harder for someone with less than 50% of the hash rate. i0/ixcoin make it even easier due to the time travel exploit not being fixed and the lack of an active developer/maintainer to set checkpoints regularly. This would be a significant manual effort and not something I want to do. It'll also raise complaints if I refuse a withdraw due to suspicious activity and then get hammered for it on the forums.I didn't want to close the exchange. But I had to given the existing situation. What i0/ixcoin needs for exchanges to safely operate are:* More hash power* An active maintainer of the software * Fix the time travel exploit* Regular checkpoints added to the software I provided information on why it's closing down. I provided information about the double spend attempts on the i0coin block chain. The ixcoin chain has the same problems - it has a low hash rate and has no one maintaining the chain software to provide fixes. The risk is to great for the exchange to operate in this environment. If you want the chain to succeed and exchanges to open then you need to do something about encouraging more people mining and more usage of the coin.  Others in the forum here have indicated that other exchanges may open to facilitate trade in these coins. You may not be holding worthless coins you may just have to wait for another exchange. You could even operate one yourself or do 'over the counter' trades in forums and IRC. If you're worried that your coins are worthless do something about it and make them worth something. I have not asked or imposed on anyone to cover my losses. The withdrawal fee has always been there. Users of the exchange were able to see the fee and choose to deposit or not knowing that there's a fee to withdraw. That fee is solely there to cover the network transaction fee for sending and receiving coins. Knowing a fee exists the risk is upon the user that if circumstances require them to withdraw they need to pay that fee. In a previous comment you raise an analogy of early termination charges on insurance policies. The withdrawal fee here is not an 'early termination' fee. It's a fee to cover what the bitcoin network charges for transferring money and has been charged always - whether 'terminating early' or not.You are making it sound like I'm charging a fee to recoup losses. This is not the case. The balance of the accounts within the exchange are stored in a database, not the block chain. So when a double spend occurs, the other end of the trade still gets the BTC updated in the database. The exchange itself is short the money but the trader is not. I have made good on the losses. The exchange was structured to minimize any loss (compared to the entire BTC balance the exchange held) knowing that I'd be covering it. Bitcoin is vulnerable to attacks involving a majority of computing power, yes. So is every other bitcoin-based chain. SolidCoin 2 claims to have solved it but there's no details on what they've done on that chain. I'm aware of this. Why do you think I'm not? There's nothing that can be done to avoid attacks by someone with greater than 50% hashrate (with current coin designs) since they can re-write the chain at will - all they need is time. Right, none had the time warp issue fixed. That definitely needs to be fixed on new chains to make it harder for >51% exploits. Such an attacker can still do whatever they want though, it just takes longer. Merged mining helps if it means that large number of users will start mining, making it more difficult for someone to get >51%. Or finding a trusted pool to 'centralize' things for a while until growth happens. I agree that multiple chains are still a good thing and I still hope to work on pools/exchanges as the technology improves.I don't think people should just delete their ix/i0 coin wallets. It's possible someone could fix the isues, re-release a client and the coins remain valid. It just requires a committed and interested developer to push things forward. Withdrawals seem to be working - what do you mean they are locked up? The exchange still has to pay a withdrawal fee, especially as the wallet gets low on funds and hits fragmented addresses, so it doesn't make sense for it to turn it off and to incur an even greater loss than it already has. I agree. Without a trusted miner/pool giving a huge amount of hash power all new chains are exploitable in this regard. Would having the coin reject attempts to do a block reorganization  further back than a certain number of confirmations be enough? Exchanges can then have their deposit limits set sometime beyond that limit. What are the downsides to that?
btc-e.com still exchanges:  https://btc-e.com/ixc_exchange and https://btc-e.com/i0c_exchangeThere's also http://www.cryptoxchanger.com/ opening "within 10 days" according to their last announcement. They may trade i0/ix coins. Once again there was another double spend attempt on the exchange. The exchange closed block chain processing when it happened. As a result of these continued attacks I've had to close the exchange. As it says from the main page:The basic approach from the attacking user was to deposit about 120,000 I0Coins, sell them, withdraw the BTC then invalidate/remove the original deposit. All the successful attacks (totaling 198 bitcoins or so) were done by a user operating over TOR. The user used accounts with names like:* youdozeek* mooncoin* ploti* adolf* mojimcheoThe bitcoin addresses that were withdraw too were:* 13kf6BR32STEuW7FSKVbM3WNUcF6nqcP3q* 1H3Zx5a7fTWnpt8pfZnwekQzQYb4497vWb* 1AKxgg8jESUvooeHtNvaSQYhbPCyv7wYZF* 1G8XACmUXoTF3FaA5bATSD3fnSR2WQXVJH* 1PoUHcuTqoSiKupYzkQUbPHE4SwTPBT9HtIf you were one of these users and don't believe you did a deliberate double spend, please get in touch. Mooncoin had namecoin poker - but that story didn't end so well so doesn't make the best 'first service' example. By which you mean he kicked you from #namecoin when you were spreading FUD and not listening to everyone else in the channel pointing out your errors. I'm interested in knowing if you are mr_moon, not whether you've committed a crime. It's entirely possible mr_moon got hacked or otherwise lost control of the server containing the wallet and is handling the situation badly. If that is the case I'd prefer he just come out and help with fund tracking - wallet addresses, etc from backups he should have. mr_moon said he was traveling when the server originally went down so whether you were on a field internship or not doesn't affect your likelihood of being or knowing mr_moon. Another block chain rollback was attempted and the exchange stopped processing blocks until I look into it.  For a non-programmer you post a few programming questions to ruby on rails lists. There's been a bunch of discussion about that paste in other threads. See here for more digging on mr_moon and what happened. I don't have any solidcoins. The bitparking exchange wallet still has about 20,000 in it though, many of them claimed by users via email but no current way for them to get them since the network is down. Once solidcoin is resurrected they'll be transferred back, assuming that's possible. Interestingly that 'different ip' (209.237.253.79) is very similar to the ip used by mr_moon when he briefly appeared to post his 'pastebin' link claiming the exchange was hacked:You say you don't know how to program but your github account links to a C++ project that lists you as a contributor.  You'll need to tweak the call to json_loads. It changed the number of arguments it accepted between the 1.x and 2.x versions of libjansson. I've posted in another bitcointalk thread some details on mr_moon based on his IP address, the wikipedia pages that were edited using that IP, and links between pages edited and another bitcoin IRC user who has the same IP address as mr_moon. mr_moon registered his irc nick 6 minutes after the other user last appeared on IRC. Yes, he's paradoxart on reddit too selling his art. There's a couple of moonco.in related posts too. Following up to my last post. Christian Verdun lurked in irc as 'upisdown' in #bitcoin-otc. His OTC rating is here. Doing a '/msg nickserv info upisdown' on Freenode I get:That IP address is the same as the IP address that was Mr Moon's moonco.in server, and the IP address Moon lurked in #namecoin, and posted to forums and email. Could it be a university shared IP and they were both behind the same NAT or something? An IP Address that Mr Moon used was 24.7.158.162. This list of wikipedia pages edited by this IP address are here. This list includes namecoin related edits. It also includes edits to Christian Verdun and a disambiguation page for 'Paradox', an art piece by Christian Verdun. There are a lot of edits associated with that. Christian Verdun sells artwork for bitcoins and solid coins here. Maybe Mr Moon knows him? Or he knows Mr Moon? Christian goes to UC Davis, not far from Sacramento where Mr Moon's IP address is geolocated.Christian Verdun appears to be upisdown on the bitcointalk forums here. He has posted as being a user of moonco.in. Mr Moon's Wikipedia page edits include plant related pages, a topic that Christian indicates as being interested in studying at UC Davis in this interview.Christian/Uptown, if you read this, have you had any contact with Mr Moon since the closing of his site? I think the windows binaries are included in the source distribution: https://github.com/fusebox/i0coin Several former Solidcoin exchanges? To my knowledge there were only bitparking, moonco.in, ruxum, solidcoin24 and btc-e. Bitparking is not doing it. Moonco.in is highly unlikely. I can't see Ruxum being keen on doing an alternate currency again. So that leaves solidcoin24 and btc-e. What other former exchange were there? He changed to bcrypt recently but you had to change your password to have it re-encrypted. Did you test after that? The I0Coin exchange (and the other bit parking exchanges) have some protection against exploits involving rolling back the block chain to steal money from the exchange. They stop processing blocks at any attempt to rollback beyond the deposit confirmation limit. This has already happened once, yesterday, at a 10 confirmation limit, and today at a 20 confirmation limit. The I0Coin exchange is still closed for deposits/withdraws as a result of the latter while I examine the logs to see what was attempted. I'm also logging IP addresses of nodes sending rollback transactions to track down the nodes involved.One upside of these attempts is it has given me a number of ideas on how to make an exchange safer against such attacks. I hope to implement some of these in a future exchange project and will be unlikely to be opening any further exchanges until this is done. There's just too much that can go wrong with low hash chains and exchanges. Same problem as last time. A block reorg going back further than the deposit confirmation limited caused the exchange to stop processing blocks. I'll look into it to see what caused it and re-enable deposits/withdrawals when it looks safe.
try http://allchains.info for that data. I'm inclined to agree. The bitparking I0Coin exchange stopped accepting blocks last night when it detected a chain reorg going back 10 blocks, past the 10 confirmations required for a deposit. So even with 90 second blocks, 10 wasn't enough. That chain only has half the hash rate of GG though. Someone tried rewriting the block chain 10 blocks back, which is the number of confirmations the exchange waits for deposits. The exchange has locked the block chain down automatically. I'm looking into it. I agreed that it would be good to start early and was willing to do so as long as the namebit people were involved and the time traveling attack was fixed. This is what I sent in an email to someone who contacted me about it:I never heard back from vinced so did not update to the new block number for merged mining. I'll be enabling a way for people to withdraw their funds soon. I won't be enabling deposit until chain authors fix the existing issues and/or BitcoinEXpress withdraws the threat. In previous posts BitcoinEXpress has said he would attack other chains. Obviously this puts any exchange on those chains at risk hence my stopping deposits and withdrawals in the meantime. If you outline your so called "checkpoint hopping" exploit and other chain attacks for the chain authors to provide solutions for I can consider re-opening them. In the meantime they'll remained closed until I'm confident that a safe way for people to withdraw the funds is available. If you want them opened quicker I suggest you contact the chain authors to fix them.In posts on the namecoin forums you've stated that amicable resolutions can be reached and implied that if I open an exchange for the GG chain you wouldn't attack namecoin. You even emailed me personally recently asking me to open a GG exchange. Why would I want to run any exchange with the issues you profess plans to exploit existing? Sadly it was a necessary step to protect the exchange against the threat until ixcoin/i0coin provides steps to defend against it. You jest, vinced hardly ever talks to anyone and waits weeks before sending responses. It'd take years to build up enough of a conversation to get a decent grudge going. Nope, once he hits block 19,200 he can merge mine. This allows him to earn bitcoins and attack namecoin at the same time. Don't keep them in bitparking. It'll be shutting down all namecoin transactions in a few days or block 19000, whichever comes first. If the attack succeeds all namecoins will be considered lost, the exchange will be closed permanently. If it fails the exchange will reopen for withdrawals. If the network hits 19,200 and there is a reasonable hash rate going then I'll consider reopening trades.  Where did I say I'd ignore you? I'm taking your warning and closing down my exchanges. Didn't artforz's exploit rely on the geitz method of calculating difficulty adjustments using the times on blocks? I don't think namecoin does this does it? Notifying exchanges doesn't prevent monetary loss. If the rewrite occurs then the exchange will end up with a different balance of namecoins compared to the balance held in the exchange database. Loss will occur due to the exchange losing the coins but still having the users balance reflect what they originally deposited. Even adjusting for the blockchain reorganization the exchange loses in time and effort to fix up transactions and deal with irate users who have lost coins.The only way for an exchange to avoid this is to close. It looks like there are none. Thanks, I've disabled trading in the meantime since I currently have poor network connectivity due to traveling which makes it difficult to fix issues. One thing to test would be to withdraw namecoins from the exchange and try to reverse it.  It's interesting but the difficulty/mining issue that ArtForZ found makes me wary of running any exchange or pool. Has that been fixed? I don't know if he's disappeared but just wanted to comment on the above. My exchange had over 350,000 SC at shutdown. I assume moonco.in got a fair few of those. It'd be interesting to know how many SC's are out of circulation while its down. I have shutdown the namecoin exchange while this attack is in process. I'll bring it up shortly with trading disabled to enable withdrawal of funds and reduce the danger of double spend issues. No bounty needed, thanks for using the exchange in the past  MrMoon, how many confirmations do you wait for for deposits? Your site says one but one confirmation seems pretty dangerous since it makes it much easier for a double spend to occur. Note that this is not intended as an attack on your site, it's a genuine question and suggestion to make it safer. 
Average is 37 minutes for you so more than and hour is still reasonable. It means some of the changes that CoinHunter/RealSolid's made in the commits below  are buggy:https://github.com/doublec/solidcoin/commit/dd35c2a8876e7a5b2dee602911a0f4d3e9ef5323https://github.com/doublec/solidcoin/commit/1f61387e8291d1c054c45d1b1517a3385cc1f45a Payouts for the Bitparking pool and exchange are slightly slow at the moment due to what appears to be a solidcoin bug where the client lags behind the real blockchain. This results in long transaction confirmation times. I've updated the exchange page with this information, along with other solidcoin issues I hit while using it. Thanks for the kind words! IXcoin's back online already. I announced it in #ixcoin-discussion a few hours ago. Sorry, I edited just after I posted and added "I'm of the opinion that any future alternate chain needs to bring something substantially new to the table rather than just tweaking existing things.". I'm still interested in alternate chains and what they can improve or do differently. Correct, I have no further interest in solidcoins. I'm of the opinion that any future alternate chain needs to bring something substantially new to the table rather than just tweaking existing things. If this is the case they must be truly awful public relations people. The bugs that caused Ruxum to close were caused by the SolidCoin developers. Which particular changes do you think makes them good developers? RealSolid removed the COPYING file from the source distribution. That file, the license, states:He also renamed the copyright in each file from 'Bitcoin Developers' to 'Solidcoin Developers'. When called out for this by one of the bitcoin developers he refused to change saying something to the effect of "Why should you have a copyright on the bugs you've added". Would you be happy if someone took your open source code, removed the license and changed all the copyright statements to be someone else? You triggered an automated system for suspicious trading and got a temporary IP ban. I've lifted it now. Technically SolidCoin is violating the bitcoin license due to the removal of the COPYING file in the source distribution which has this text:Not to mention the global replacement of the copyright notice of the bitcoin developers in all the source files to be 'solidcoin developers'. I have no interest in this, sorry. The buy and sell orders are listed in the 'Deposit' tab. They are still there and are able to be cancelled. There are issues with the solidcoin client and network causing delays in confirmations in some transactions. This is related to the transaction and block limit sizes recently introduced as well as the developer keeping the 1.02 client available for download on the solidcoin site even though 1.03 and 1.031 were released. It's even possible for transfers from the 1.02 client to be forever stuck at 0/unconfirmed due to the new rules in the later versions not accepting them. If you still have not got the funds in 24 hours, PM me with the address you withdrew to and I'll track down what the issue is. Don't forget the new license text: Latest release of SolidCoin source posted in IRC contains a 'readme' document with the following text: Everyone should be aware of this I hope. I'd never run an alt-chain related binary without checking the source compared to a known bitcoin release and analysing the differences then building from source. Again, just clarifying things. I'm not involved in solidcoin development. I do run an exchange and pool for solidcoin. I created that git repo to make it easy for me to diff and compare new solidcoin changes to make sure nothing bad is embedded before I build and deploy to the exchange and pool. It's not an 'official solidcoin' release source. That still affects the exchange operator in that they have angry clients who lose their solidcoins that they've paid bitcoins for. The first couple of solidcoin releases did include checkpoints btw. Based on my reading the latest only contains the fix to the transaction spam issue.  Just to clarify, that's my commit history, grouping changes from a source code diff of the released zipped source files, since CoinHunter didn't provide a git history himself. I didn't go into detail in the GUI commits to break out individual fixes for example. Not to mention that such an attack affects the exchange operator and doesn't affect the creator or developers.
There is a new issue that prevents the bitparking exchange from opening. The new limits stop some transfers from occurring and exchanges hit these pretty easily when withdrawals are made. Discussion on the change goes on in the namecoin forums at dot-bit.org if you want to raise questions. The actual developer of the change posts there. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Alternative_Chainshttps://github.com/vinced/namecoin/blob/master/doc/README_merged-mining.md Buying and selling to yourself doesn't let you get any price you want. Stopping buys/sells to yourself just opens up other manipulations that can be done once the person knows that the exchange avoids their own buy/sell walls. The dis-incentive for buying/selling your own order is it costs you in fees. What logs? The exchange history from a few days ago is downloadable and I can do a more up to date version. It doesn't have usernames though. If you have usernames you suspect of cheating PM me and I'll look them up, I'm running the new client on my machine, my pool and the bitparking exchange. All show the block count as 20027. If you're running the old client I'm pretty sure transfers to/from the exchange won't work as it's on the new client. I haven't seen any large withdrawals from the bitparking exchange compared to usual activity.  The patch is in this tree: https://github.com/vinced/namecoin/tree/mergedmineThat's what you'd need to apply to your local solidcoin - the one your miner issues getworks to.  You'd need to run the version of namecoin including the merge mining patch, and wait for block 19,200 to pass on the namecoin network as that's when it's set to enable. More details on merge mining itself are here: https://github.com/vinced/namecoin/blob/mergedmine/doc/README_merged-mining.md This is what I was curious to see if it was what he was referring to. What I did is work out what the average transaction fee is and I charge approximately that. I don't put the 0.01 fee as part of the transaction because then the average would be even higher.Due to the way exchanges work they get a lot of small deposits and some large withdrawals. This fragments the wallet and the large withdrawals have to pull from lots of small addresses. This carries a large fee. I've had transaction fees close to 1 coin. As an example from the namecoin exchange, where the fees work like bitcoin:Code:    {        "account" : "",        "address" : "NH56eFFnzHoieLCpR7kfToTcf6wX5L2AHf",        "category" : "send",        "amount" : -5000.00000000,        "fee" : -0.75000000,        "confirmations" : 3702,        "txid" : "d8b597c7875d7c6668150abf5009cee2b74c2fd5c3ad7fb90066351c2e812ec6",        "time" : 1309517469    }I settled on 0.01 as the average and pass this on. Unfortunately the *coin clients don't provide a way to find the fee 'up front' to charge. SolidCoin being the exception here. You can actually bankrupt an exchange that doesn't pass on the transaction fee like this by depositing lots of small amounts and then a large amount over and over. Can't you merge mine solidcoin by treating solidcoin as the primary chain and use a secondary chain built with merge mining? eg. solidcoin and namecoin as the two chains. This would require the miner to have solidcoin with the merged mine patch that the namecoiners provide for bitcoin. Only the miner needs the patch, the solidcoin network doesn't need to update.  Bitparking pool and exchange have been restarted and are using the new client. What exchanges charge a withdrawal fee that aren't just passing the transaction fee onto the customer? Redirecting to the https version can be problematic too since any authentication cookie will have been sent in the clear on the initial http request. Hopefully the exchange has marked the cookies to only be used on https connections and not http connections. It has no way of know which entities are contributing. Your solidcoin withdrawals page says "(You pay a 0.1 the 0.1 transfer fee.) ", so not quite no withdrawal fees.  I won't lose a fortune since the exchange doesn't keep all the funds online. When it runs out of the 'working set', withdrawals are put on hold until I replenish from the offline wallet. It'd be annoying for sure, but not bank breaking. There isn't anything (that I know of) that can be done about a >51% participant unfortunately. I'm pretty sure you're out of luck. If you lose the passphrase you can't decrypt the wallet. CoinHunter, the SolidCoin creator, does not host an ixcoin order table for bitparking. The ixcoin order table is run by the solidcoins.info owner by using the bitparking API, as announced in this thread. Nice, I've linked to you from the exchange. Yes, I'll work on a server ping method, it's a good idea. There are 701 users on the bitparking exchange with a balance of solidcoins greater than zero. It doesn't give an indication of actual users since they'll be people who don't use the exchange, and people who have withdrawn their solidcoins so the exchange doesn't hold it, but it may help gauge the size.
If you mean the '/api/t' URL, it's cached at 60 minutes. '/api/t2' is cached at 10 seconds.  How so? It's working for me. eg. 'curl http://i0exchange.bitparking.com:8080/api/o' works fine. bitparking i0coin exchange is open for trading again now. Ruxum trades Namecoin <-> USD. I've reset the order book, and enabled deposits/withdrawal of i0coins again. The exchange will open for trading 2011-08-30 11:00am UTC. That's 7 hours from now. I sent you some btc to the address in your sig as thanks for your work, nice job! The bitparking i0coin pool is now running this new version. Once things seem to be stable I'll re-open the i0coin side of the exchange. Send an email to the email address in the 'whois' of the domain. Or PM me. The NTP code was broken in the original release. It would cause i0coind to hang if the NTP server didn't respond. It'd be good if that can be fixed. I disabled the NTP code on my systems otherwise it was too reliable. Works fine for me, PM me your error if you're getting one. Yeah, I'll enable the exchange once it's been running for a bit and seems to be working ok. I'll update my pool with the new code though to help move it along. What timezone are you using on solidcoins.info? Can you put a time there somewhere? The API returned from bitparking uses UTC+12 (NZ time).  Do you hit the bitparking API on every request to solidcoins.info? I'm seeing requests many times per second from you. Is it possible to cache it on your end and hit every 5 seconds or something? I love the site by the way, it's great!  Awesome, thanks! And great to see an e-wallet for SC online! Thanks Lorna! sT4nHpQFTCo9UcNSnSwp8eEUqGgJe6DMrX This is my attempt to break down the solidcoin changes made since the bitcoin version it was based on: https://github.com/doublec/solidcoinThe tag 'solidcoin/v000' is the initial bitcoin release. The tags 'solidcoin/v102' is the current source available for download. There are minor differences due to whitespace changes but this shows the code changes. This might help you identify the 40-50  bug fixes that coinhunter is talking about. I've added two variables, the high and low price in the last 24 hours. You could maybe find a midpoint between these as an average. There is an 'average' price in the ticker which is a weighted average over the last 24 hours but it has an intermittent bug which can make this lower than the low price for the day. I haven't included this since that'll cause problems with your pricing. When I've fixed that bug I'll add it and let you know. By emailing the contact email in the 'whois' of the domain, or asking 'doublec' on freenode irc, or PMing me here. Preferably in that order. Just be careful that you don't use the value of those variables in the page sent to the server for the actual order that is done. They can be manipulated by the user using firebug, web console, or some other web development tool. You should use them for showing the user the approximate price, and the final price should be retrieved by the server itself, not sent from the page. Hope that makes sense, and apologies if I'm telling you something you already are aware of. The problem is that you're basically doing a cross site request which isn't supported in browsers. Some of the newer browsers support a protocol called CORS and will let you do it if I configure my server to allow it. The details are here. Let me know if you want to try that and I'll enable it.Another option is to retrieve the ticker URL from your server, and make a request from your page to your server to get the data. This is usually the most reliable method. I've just added an new API that might makes things easier. There's now a URL that will output two javascript variable definitions containing the current buy and sell prices: http://scexchange.bitparking.com:8080/api/scprices You can include that with a script element in your HTML page and it should define the variables which you can use later:Code:<script src='http://scexchange.bitparking.com:8080/api/scprices' type='application/javascript'></script>...alert(solidcoin_sellprice);Let me know how that goes or if you want anything changed. The message comes up when load is high, the order book is moved from the main page. Lots of bots scrape it instead of using the API for some reason. http://www.solidcoins.info has a good order book pulling from the api.
I believe the origin of the Bank of America quote is from the betabeat article about Gavin's keynote at the conference:They've actually changed that since they originally wrote the article. It was originally a stronger statement. Presumably Gavin corrected them. It was "He said he hopes that in five years, Bitcoin will be boring. As in, no calls from reporters, no hype and no drama. Just a niche currency with a robust communitypossibly administered by Bank of America.". Works for me. Make sure you enter your exchange user id, not your open id, in the login box. It'll then redirect you to the open id you used at sign up. Just modify blkmond so that it works on the solidcoin network. All you need to do is change it so it uses the pchMessageStart used by solidcoin, and connect to your running solidcoind using the right port. It means it's set to 0.01 SC in the client. For it to change the client has to be modified and a large number of nodes updated to run it. I'm well aware of how blkmond works having modified it for many of the other chains. I also run my own SolidCoin pool which definitely supports long polling. And as I said the SC BTCGuild pool also supports longpolling. Your claim that you are the only pool that supports long polling is incorrect. This is not true, every solidcoin pool I know of has long polling support. You have lower stales because you've started your pool at a time when difficulty is higher and blocks aren't being created so fast. You also have less users. Pools, like the SC Guild pool, which have a large number of users take time to notify all long pollers that a new block has been found which is one reason why stales can be a little bit higher. So while I think it can be right for you to advertise lower stales for now, you're wrong about being the only pool with long polling. No, the pool is still running at a loss. As of this writing it has found 9,125 blocks. That's a total of 292,000 SC. At 5% fee that's 14,600 SC income for the pool. Of those blocks 509 were orphaned. That's 16,288 SC paid out to users in orphan blocks that the pool did not receive. So the pool is running at a 1,688 SC loss. That's about 50 BTC worth or $400 USD at current value. The pool pays out on orphans. I think it's the only pool that does that. The fee is higher to help cover that. There are plenty of other pools if you prefer a different payout mechanism. I think "Bitparking.com Steels Bitcoins..." is slighty more than "a bit accusing". Correct me if I'm wrong but bitcoin uses wxwidgets-2.9 as well. Ok, thanks. I'll update my exchange and pool this weekend. Will nodes have to be restarted at this time or will they automatically start using the new marker? I guess there will be a bit of churn around this time too as nodes with skewed clocks change early or late. It builds fine for me on linux. Make sure you build and install wxwidgets-2.9.2 with no options disabled. SolidCoin uses a feature that bitcoin doesn't. coinotron lists the alternate chains and which ones are profitable to mine vs btc. At some point the bitcoin binary is compiled and released by a single individual. It's possibly for them to slip something in that steals wallets too and hard for anyone to find out. How are you to know they source they compiled the binary with is the source that was scrutinized? Deposits and withdrawals in for i0coins in the i0coin exchange are suspended until the issue is fixed. This is to prevent withdrawals occurring on a 'split' chain and the receipient on a different split of the chain not getting their funds. Let's hope the developers comes up with a fix! Yes, you're right, I just tested. It looks like the i0coin network is dead. Perhaps the maintainer of the software can comment. It's immediate. PM me details if you think something is incorrect and I'll explain why it isn't. if you're running Gnome or DBUS then the JSON-RPC port used by solidcoin is probably conflicting. They both use 7556. Add the 'rpcport=...' option in solidcoin.conf, setting '...' to another port number. Most likely it's because browser's don't allow XMLHttpRequests on domains other than the page they are being served from. This is known as 'Cross Origin' requests and is limited by the 'same domain policy'. The usual workaround is to make the request on your server, or proxy it from your webserver, so you can retrieve it coming from your own domain.
They're using a third party payment service, https://coinb.in/. Maybe there should be a bounty for a SolidCoin equivalent, or for coinbin to support it. Start the client with -addnode= set to an IP address of a known node. Try "-addnode=206.71.179.116" for example. There was huge mining interest at the beginning, like what happens with most block chains that start. Blocks were being created every few seconds. This is why a large number were mined in a short period. This is likely to happen periodically as the difficulty drops, miners join, and then leave when it rises. As a general rule I'd value a new currency at 0.001 or less at launch in the absence of an exchange. That seems to be the price they settle around for a while. How do you know this? Do you have data to support the claim? These alternative chains like SolidCoin are trying these ideas giving everyone the opportunity to gather that data. At some point someone can examine the success or failure and see what the effect the changes have. People worry that tying a currency to bitcoin via merged mining might be bad for the new currency. It will essentially be produced 'for free' by miners, have an excess of supply,  and be valued appropriately.  Looks like they haven't adjusted the algorithm for addresses in the block explorer to use solidcoin's instead of bitcoin's. Thanks for the kind words! Yeah I bumped the fees up. This is also gives others more opportunity to undercut and less people accusing me of monopolizing the alternate chain services. I've put a SolidCoin version of my pool and exchange software up so you can mine and exchange SolidCoins for Bitcoins. Pool is at http://scpool.bitparking.com and the exchange is at https://scexchange.bitparking.com. What is stablecoin? I did originally. I put an initial buy and sell in to set the market. Both orders have been cancelled now that others have funds in the exchange. I also did the first buy at 0.49 that someone else was selling for to test. Do: I've put an exchange up for solidcoins to bitcoins: https://scexchange.bitparking.com/main What are the issues? If you can build any of the other chains, this should just build. I brought the pool up when it was made public soon after block 940. My pool is custom written, not using pushpoold. I can bring up a pool for a new currency by changing a couple of configuration parameters and it's on. What's the problem with the client? What platform? It'll happen eventually anyway. People will want to trade it even if it's otc. You can avoid getting burned by not participating in the speculation.  There's a pool up at http://scpool.bitparking.com/pool. Note the extra fee over my other pools! I lost money on the i0 and ix coin pools due to the fact I pay out on orphans and there are a lot in the early stages. I'm upped the fee a bit in this earlier period to hopefully adjust. I'm considering an exchange. Yes, it adjusts much faster than bitcoin. According to the solidcoin faq: Your friend gambled and lost and now you're upset at the casino? I'm sure people have done the same with bitcoin. Are you railing at the evilness of Satoshi too?
I agree. They make good tests for features that could be included in bitcoin without risking the existing bitcoin network. Is there a changelog? Or source? The github repository doesn't seem to have been updated. Yeah, but this pool's page is comparing their 1% proportional to Deepbit's 10% for PPS as an advantage of their pool. The front page of your pools says:Are you really paying out more per block than the block actually produces? That's very generous of you. You also say deepbit's fee is 10%. Isn't it 3%? There's not really much you can do to stop people from setting up an exchange though. Even if they just trade in forums it's effectively become a vehicle for speculation. This is pretty much it. The i0coin exchange earnt 3 bitcoins and 1100 i0coins in fees since opening. When opening a new exchange I'm mainly interested in the bitcoin side of the equation unless it seems likely that the alternative coins will take off long term.An ixcoin/i0coin exchange would be mostly speculative on my part since I'd have no idea if either coin is likely to be worth anything. And with 0.2% fees on coins worth 1% of a bitcoin, it wouldn't pay for server costs unless trading was huge. I don't think trading would be huge (what i0coiner wants ixcoins and vice versa?) and if anything bots would remove all arbitrage opportunities quickly.Not saying I wouldn't do it, but it's unlikely given the work involved. Setting up the exchange is easy - it's the support for it that's time consuming. 0.2% is not a large fee. The i0coin exchange made 3 bitcoins since opening in fees. I'm not sure that qualifies as 'nice profit'. What platform? 'bitcoind' runs in server mode even if it doesn't return you to the command prompt. The JSON-RPC server is still running. You'd add '-daemon' or 'daemon=1' in the .conf file to get the behaviour to fork itself in the background (on linux anyway). No, if they ran 'i0coind' then it uses server mode automatically. If they ran 'i0coin' with the GUI then they'd need '-server'. Without it their miner would not be able to connect and would give an error. You don't see mined blocks immediately because they take 120 confirmations to mature. Then they are reflected in the balance. They can also be 'orphaned' in which case they are lost. This is very common at the early difficulty levels when there is massive hashing power on the network. Yes, it does. All 'server' mode does is enable the JSON-RPC interface. This is automatically done in the programs ending with 'd'. And they expire in 48 hours. I can confirm that I did this. It happens when using git HEAD without any blocks downloaded yet. As a workaround I went back to commit c81732, downloaded the existing block chain, then went back to HEAD and it worked.  Why does the blocks page show 4 blocks as having 119 confirms to go? They're real  buys  by people. The won't actually go through at that price since no one will sell at that price. They'll go through at the lower price of any sell that appears. The IX Coin pool made a loss, even charging 3%, because it pays out on orphan blocks and there are a large number that occur when blocks are flying left and right every few seconds. So the real fee wasn't 3%, it was more like -1%. i0coind has been locking up on me. The exchange, which has no i0coind transactions yet but is running a client has hung twice. The pool has hung once. This is using commit 364742d79411518ef3ee123d3d1fd653b4674354. I've fired up a test bitparking pool for i0coin. It's at http://i0pool.bitparking.com and works like the existing namecoin and ixcoin pools. I'll switch to the release i0coind when it's available. All coins will be discarded when the new chain officially starts. huge number of orphan blocks and chain splits due to blocks going by every few seconds. it'll make the currency unusable for anything without a large confirmation count until it settles down. Can you provide a summary of the differences? Number of coins you've decided to generate, how often, etc? Putting this on the i0coin page would be good.
I'll have an exchange up, yes. It'll be i0exchange.bitparking.com. Unfortunately 'release' time for i0coin is in the early hours of the morning for me so it'll be up a few hours later than release. I'll also want to monitor i0coin for an hour or two to get an idea of the block solve rate and number of orphans so I can set a reasonable deposit confirmation period. This seems risky since I don't think it has gone through any release candidate testing on bitcoin yet. Useful if you want to be the test bed for if it works or not. It'll also delay services based on ixcoin since they'll need to use the mechanisms for accessing/unlocking the wallet. That issue has already been raised and discussed in this thread and the ixcoin developer has responded. Will this potentially cause problems due to time differences in nodes? If at the two week time period two blocks are found close together, and one node says it as being less than two weeks, but the other sees it as being more, then they will have a different difficulty calculation. Could result in a chain split? It says "Now!" for me. I live in the future it seems! Faster mining usually means more orphans for miners. Do you want an exchange? I agree with you that it's a bug and I'd really like to see it fixed. Namecoin originally got this flaw because it used bitcoin style addresses originally. Then the client was update for namecoin style addresses and the bitcoin support was kept for backwards compatibility. I think both namecoin and ixcoin should be fixed to only send to the correct addresses. Get your friend to PM me, or email me at the email address in the whois of the bitparking domain, with all the details and I can recover them. You almost did. Remember that ixcoin blocks have 96 coins in them vs bitcoins 50. It's more to do with the fact that blocks are solved every few seconds due to the high network power vs the low difficulty, resulting in many blocks being solved by miners at approximately the same time and only one winning. It's a pool statistics bug. When the pool finds a block it cleans out the information it uses the calculate the hash rate, so it drops until there's enough to compute it again. They may or may not get picked up depending on your timing. Send me a PM if it doesn't and I can fix it up. It might take a day or two though. "Thomas Nasakioto <== Nice anagram btw  and bounty received, thanks! IXCoin mining pool (Not that it's really needed at the moment, but hey): http://ixpool.bitparking.com/pool Satoshi announced the bitcoin chain when it was brand spanking new, only the genesis block around. I have mined many orphan blocks sadly, no real ones.  Want to try an exchange? I forked my namecoin exchange to work with ixcoins. Needs testing  https://ixchange.bitparking.com/main I've removed the 'for testing' from the thread title since it's the oldest namecoin mining pool and has been running fine since moving to the new server 6 weeks ago. The pool has survived some of the crazy highs and lows during the profitable difficulty periods, peaking at 350 Ghash/s during the last one.
blkmond is designed to inform pushpoold of a new block being found on the network so pushpoold can inform long pollers. I'd be very surprised if it was preventing you from finding a block. Have you modified it to work on the namecoin network? As others have noted this appears to be a Mt Gox address. What makes you think it is associated with mybitcoin? This would make bitcoin an unsafe currency to trade with. Say you as a merchant receive 500 BTC. These BTC are then later marked as coming from mybitcoin.com. The merchant can no longer use these coins and are out of pocket.  If you want to buy this amount for a bulk price, PM me and we can work something out. Block rate shown by the pool is just an estimate. It drops to zero when a block is found as it starts the calculation again. I don't keep historical information of shares needed to keep the calculation active to save disk space. The difficulty goes up on a new block, so yes, your miner will start working at the new difficulty. On the bitparking pool, same namecoin address for all miners is fine. http://dot-bit.org/tools/nextDifficulty.php has the answers you seek. There is no gui. it's all controlled by the JSON-RPC server, similar to bitcoind. it's the same as bitcoin. It takes 120 confirmation for a block to mature. grod's point is if you mined bitcoins instead, and bought namecoins with those  bitcoins, you'd end up with more namecoins than if you mined them. In addition the price would rise, helping to reach the magical ratio that causes bitcoin miners to join or leave the network, making the difficulty more likely to be stable. It's normal for hashespersec to be zero when using an external miner. I implemented the API but was told by the bitcoin chart maintainers that they didn't list exchanges where the main currency wasn't BTC. In the NMC<->BTC exchange the currency being bought/sold is namecoins. You can get charts at http://www.nmcwatch.com though. vinced, the namecoin developer, has added merged mining capability, allowing shared work for the bitcoin and namecoin chains. The design notes are here. It's been running on a dedicated server for a while now, and handled 250+ fine when I switched to it from the old VPS I was using before. I don't think we'll see 300+ again personally. I think the namecoin/bitcoin price ratio will adjust much faster than in previous times when few knew about it. About 305Gh/s. It's about 1/5th of that now. It'll be interesting to see what effect the upcoming bitcoin/namecoin cross mining changes will have on price and difficulty. AFAIK there is no way, with the current bitcoin client, to request BTC's be withdrawn from a particular address. See the build-unix.txt file in the source for what the dependencies are for Ubuntu, I agree, the software needs to be easier to use, and support for domain lookup in programs needs to be implemented. I'm working on Firefox support for Namecoin lookup at the moment.
The last payout to that address was block 15003. You had 886 shares out of 188,397 and got  0.22808749 NMC.  No shares have been submitted since then. This was 2011-06-28 01:35am New Zealand time. Does this sound right? I look forward to namecoin support! Yes, namecoin is essentially a re-invention of RealNames , but decentralized and using bitcoin ideas: Я бегу bitparking. Я не говорят русские. Я использую Google Translate.Сеть namecoin потерял много добычи энергии. Блоки очень медленно, подлежащих обработке. Именно поэтому балансы не обновляется очень часто на bitparking и почему суммы ниже.Сеть namecoin нуждается в большем количестве горняков. Browsers already do this. When you enter a domain in the URL bar of the browser they can interpret this however they want. Sometimes they lookup the domain in DNS. Sometimes they use a search engine. Sometimes they use 'keywords'. Ten years ago there was a system called RealNames. This was a way for people to register a 'name' with a location. It was effectively a DNS replacement. Browsers built this in and you could go to sites by just entering the 'RealName'. At one point they had $130 million of funding. Namecoin is similar to this in concept but is decentralized. From the wikipedia entry:It would be interesting to learn from the RealName experience - why it didn't succeed. Regarding the namecoin connection, did either of you who lost coins but also used a namecoin client try any of the 'Namecoin GUI' programs that people posted about in some of the forums? At least one was a trojan of some sort IIRC. Note that these GUI programs weren't namecoin official programs, they were developed and distributed by third party forum members. My explanation wasn't an explanation of namecoin. It's a description of different ways it could be used. If someone asks me what namecoins are I say "It's a system for registering a special type of domain name". And that's fine. 99% of regular people have no idea what bitcoins are good for. These things take time to catch on. At some point regular users won't even need to know they're using a namecoin service. There was time time when 99% of regular people didn't know what a foo@example.com email address was or what an http://example.com URL was. I remember people thinking I was strange when I used those. It's early days for namecoins. Currently there is little in software and support for users of it so it's expected that the price and interest in mining would vary. Currently if you buy a domain name you are restricted in its use. You must essentially re-buy it every year and it's subject to control by ISP's, registrars and various governments (ie. domains are easily seized). Aside from the 'domain name' side of things, namecoin is a generic naming service. I'm sure other innovative ideas using it will appear.There doesn't need to be '.bit' DNS proxies for it to be used. Software can build in support for the namecoin protocol itself. For example, a poker client could use namecoin to lookup IP addresses for its servers. There's no need to worry about the user's ISP filtering their DNS for such things (like the 'blacklists' that some countries ISP's use). Torrent applications could use namecoin directly to find torrent search engines. Browsers could build in the lookup and bypass the need of '.something' and just have 'name'. I think namecoin will remain a niche for quite a while as services as software build around it. If that doesn't happen then it will probably fade away. Maybe it'll see some use as a secondary currency. If services and software do start to use it things could get more interesting. If it fails, hopefully something will learn from it and a better alternative system to DNS will rise out of it.(Disclaimer: I run a namecoin pool and exchange) You don't necessarily have to install a custom DNS. For example a torrent client could build in the ability to query the namecoin blockchain. It would then use this for name lookup. No DNS client software needed. For those that used the previous version of the bitparking namecoin pool, before I rewrote the software to what is the current version, I've sent out all the remaining balances that remained.  Nice! I have a WP7, I'll give it a try. Has it gone through? If not, PM me the details. The pool was getting overloaded. I've moved it to a new server now and it seems to be operating ok. The errors are due to the long poller having problems. What's happening is there's so much computing power on the namecoin network right now, and difficulty hasn't adjusted yet, that blocks are being solved every 2 minutes or so. With the thousands of long polling clients it's taking longer than this to notify them of a new block. So multiple blocks go by before you get the notification. At some point the long poller server locks up. Things will calm down in a day or so when difficulty adjusts to match the network speed. Anyone would be willing to do that given the rate they're selling at on the exchange...Next estimated difficulty could change things though. Big 3x jump estimated. You probably missed the 'install prerequisites part from build-unix.txt. The number of people who ask why the libdb C++ header files are missing or what's with the upnp errors... Yes. 1.

#namecoin on irc.freenode.net has an active community if you want to discuss namecoin things. You can exchange namecoins with sellers in forum threads around here, sellers on the dot-bit.org site, or the namecoin exchange. Whether it's profitable or not vs bitcoins depends on the difficulties of the two chains and the price you get for them. I'll leave that up to you to calculate. You can read more about what they are here. Um, 0.008 is in bitcoins, that 3.80 is the value in bitcoins. So multiply that by the USD rate. I probably shouldn't mention that mining namecoins is good at the moment since it'll drive the price down, but the namecoin network does need more miners. bitcoin difficulty = 567358.22457067namecoin difficulty = 2815.22139486ratio =  2815.22139486/567358.22457067         = 0.004961982Current price 1 namecoin = 0.0067 BTCHow is mining namecoins 19 times less income than mining bitcoins?   I don't think you can, with an unpatched bitcoind, get notified of a new block, or get a list of all transactions in a block. I'm just explaining why some sites have gone for the 'one shot' deposit option. It's easy to implement. There are other ways of doing it. For example every 10 minutes looking at 'listtransactions' for an address in the deposit list. For my site I'm still exploring the best ways of doing this. Lucky I don't have many users  Yeah I plan to switch to UTC. I thought the server was UTC already but forgot I'd set it up with NZ time. Lowest trades are about 0.006 bitcoins per namecoin. What does the difficulty suggest they should be trading at? Please don't advertise it as "The new better MtGox". That implies it's MtGox operating using new software or something. Maybe "The new better alternative to MtGox" or something. There are quite a few people on the namecoin network mining so I'm guessing that people are doing this. Current difficulty is 2815.22139486. Because without patching bitcoind it's a pain. You have to constantly poll the addresses to see if any deposits have gone in. Multiply this by 10,000 users and it's not scalable. So by giving a 'one shot' address you can scan only this address, and expire it after a couple of days. Why does the Trade Hill FAQ mention BitcoinExchange Services (an exchange at bitcoinexchange.cc) as if it was them?Did Trade Hill copy parts of their FAQ or are they the same? I recently rewrote the pool software to handle more load. You can still withdraw from the old pool account and I'll automatically withdraw the remaining amounts next week to those that haven't withdrawn. The new pool is operating at the same URL and port. Withdrawals from the old pool are available at http://oldpool.bitparking.com/pool. If you have any questions let me know. The .bit sites need to add a vhost entry for theirsite.namecoin.us. Some of them have done this, but yes, it's a pain. Yes. So namecoin difficulty is currently 2815.22139486. Bitcoin is 434882.72174970. So based on diffculty 1 namecoin is worth 0.00647 bitcoins. Namecoins do have intrinsic value in that they can be used to purchase namecoin domains so that may affect the price somewhat. The high on the exchange is 0.009 and the low is 0.006 at the time of writing this. The OpenID stuff is definitely a bit of a pain at the moment. I'm trying to track down the issues. Part of the motivation for writing the exchange was to stress test the implementation of the language/framework I used to build it. It's done a good job of that in parts. I've tweaked the OpenID a bit again and would be interested if anyone see's the 'Signature didn't match' again (may require deleting existing browser cookies for the exchange site). There is an exchange operating at https://exchange.bitparking.com if you want to try buying there. I've done this and recovered the coins. If you've sent namecoins to a bitcoin address you can fix it by having the owner of the bitcoin address doing this:1. Stop bitcoind and namecoind2. Backup the namecoin wallet.dat somewhere3. Copy the bitcoin wallet.dat into the ~/.namecoin directory, overwiting the existing wallet.dat (make sure you did step 2)4. start namecoind with: namecoind -rescan5. Assuming you have the full namecoin blockchain you'll see the coins in the balance. You can then 'sendtoaddress' to a real namecoin address6. stop namecoind7. copy your namecoin wallet.dat backup back into ~/.namecoin8. start namecoind with: namecoind -rescanIf you've sent bitcoin addresses to a namecoin address follow the same steps, swapping namecoin and bitcoin around. Note that it's the recipient of the original send, the owner of the address, that must do these steps. It's probably even better to do all this in a virtual machine with clean wallets so you don't accidentally overwrite your own wallet. See if this post helps. Also try dot-bit.org. Can you try signing up again? The lack of accepting the cookie in the first place may have prevented it from going through. I don't see a record from that openid url.  See this post on namecoins for details. That's what I hear about bitcoin too.  Funny how people resist new ideas.
A virtual currency designed to build an alternative to the DNS system. See these sites for details:http://dot-bit.org/Main_Pagehttp://namecoin.us/http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2011/05/12/namecoin-a-dns-alternative-based-on-bitcoin.html Ok, I'm using myOpenID as well but not using delegation. I'll test with that. Are you using Verisign's service? I'm having issues getting that working. Hopefully in a day or two.  I made a small change - can you try again and see if it works? Are you using the Google button or entering your openid identity directly? I've started a Namecoin exchange where you can buy and sell Namecoins for Bitcoins: https://exchange.bitparking.comIt's pretty new, only a few days old, but has had a few trades put through it. I'd appreciate any feedback for features and reports for bugs.  I'm keen! They keep the transaction fees for themselves. They don't distribute it to the miners. They use these fees to cover the fees involved in sending payments out to users. Since their payments are 'instant' they also need funds available to send payments out that are requested while blocks are still 'immature'. The fees are also used for that. That's how I understood what was said. Instructions are available from the freecoin repository:https://github.com/sacarlson/freecoin/blob/master/create_new_genisis_block.txt This is correct. Using the same address is fine. So is using different addresses. See here: http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=898.0I don't know what state it currently is in (whether it prints a message or shuts off the RPC interface). There's a glut in the market. Tens of thousands of namecoins for sale and with the price of domains dropping rapidly, currently 31.09 NC per domain, the demand is low. You don't need "-server", this is automatically applied when running namecoind. Just like with bitcoin, the "hashespersec" will show zero if you use an external getwork based miner.  Your miner should tell you if it is working or not (it'll show a hash rate and/or accepted blocks). Yes, you need to wait 120 blocks when a block is found. Your miner will tell you when you found a block. You can use 'listtransactions' to see immature blocks and how many confirmations they've had. Does Satoshi still have the capability to send an alert out to clients to shut them down in case of a network emergency? Or have clients changed that? I don't understand the topupkeypool command. Can you explain why it is needed, and how the user is supposed to know to run it. What happens if they don't and the keypool (whatever that is) runs out? And back to 2 Ghash. The pool server handled the load, but did identify a bunch of places I need to tweak. Someone's helping test my pool software scalability. The namecoin pool temporarily at 11 Ghash/s. I restarted the pool a couple of times today to fix a memory leak and excessive CPU usage. The server is ticking along much nicer now.  PM me your address and I'll try to track it down. I can send it manually too. Someone is mining in the pool with an address of N5gW....4z3 but they've got a spurious '.NameCoin' appended to it. Possibly they intended for this to be the password? This means you won't be able to withdraw your coins since the address is invalid. PM me when you've changed your address and I'll fix things up. Thanks to Nesetalis' help tracking this down, ufasoft should now work fine.
It looks like there are problems using ufasoft's miner. I'm looking into it. Great thanks! If you post or PM me a namecoin address I'll send you a tip. It looks like cellminer is sending a Content-Type of application/x-www-form-url-encoded (which is standard for POST requests from HTML forms). This is upsetting my server since it expects the POST data to be in name/value form pairs. Can you change cellminer to send no content type or to send application/json? Thanks, I'll try and track the problem with cellminer down. I started a pool for mining namecoins. It uses standard bitcoin miners and is share based like other pools. Miners solve difficulty 1 shares and get a proportion of the generated coins based on their contribution. The pool takes a 3% fee and coins are available for withdrawal immediately a block is generated - no waiting for maturity.Details are at the Bitparking Namecoin Pool Page. Basically you point your miner to the server at http://bitparking.com:9098 and use a Namecoin address as your username. The password can be anything. Withdrawals are only available to that Namecoin address. To withdraw, go to http://bitparking.com/pool, enter the address in the form and press the button. That takes you to your miner statistics. There will be a withdrawal button there if you have any coins.Information on setting up a namecoin client to create the address you need can be found in my  blog post about namecoins The server is 'bitcoind'. The miner is 'bitcoinr'. Run the server with something like:Code:bitcoind -remoteserver -remotebindaddr=0.0.0.0 -distributiontype=contributed It might be too technical, but I blogged about it recently: http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2011/05/12/namecoin-a-dns-alternative-based-on-bitcoin.html I received my shirt in New Zealand. Many thanks, very happy with the quality! I shall frame the 'Thanks for being our first customer' message for when you get huge and famous as the number one bitcoin shirt sellers! Yes. You need to also set up your webserver to have the correct domain (including the .bit) as a virtual host to serve the pages to clients requesting via that Host name. There can also be issues with transparent proxies run by your ISP. An ISP at one location where I am refuses to serve up .bit domains as they sniff the HTTP traffic and do DNS lookups on the Host: line in the HTTP headers. This fails and the request dies. If the pool is just for you, and you don't care about solving lower difficulty shares and distributing payments, then just point all your miners to single bitcoind instance. It will work just like a pool. It's easier just to do this. What's the point of using an alternative to DNS when you're just forwarding to an existing DNS?  It should be 'namecoin' already. See CNamecoinHooks in namcoin.cpp. Technically the bitcoind software already includes everything for a pool. Multiple clients can connect and use the 'getwork' RPC call to get a block to work on. What pool software provides is the ability to adjust the difficulty, count share for different users and pay them when a block is found. But if you don't want that part, and just want to combine a bunch of machines, then you can use bitcoind on its own. #bitcoin-otc operates a web of trust. Just limit your trades to those with a high rating. Try: bitcoind -daemon Go to #bitcoin-otc on irc.freenode.net (Visit the bitcoin-otc website for details). There are many people there willing to trade directly with Mt Gox dollars. You can often get a 1:1 trade selling mtgox dollars for paypal USD. To transfer to the other users mtgox account you enable 'merchant services' on your account and you'll have a menu item allowing to send to another user. Namecoin works like bitcoin. Instead of mining bitcoins you mine namecoins. Namecoin adds some new commands to register, change the setting of, and list domains. It costs around 50 namecoins to buy a domain. Once bought you can point it to an IP address. You need to run special programs to make your software use these domains but once you do you can then look them up under the '.bit' domain. For example, someone bought 'tester' for about 50 namecoins. Now, with the lookup software installed, I can got to http://tester.bit in my browser and it works. It works exactly like bitcoind. So:Code:namecoind getnewaddress If you don't want to use someone elses DNS server you can set up dnsmasq on ubuntu pretty easily to serve namecoin domains and fall back to your normal DNS. This approach uses a small program I wote to generate secondary hosts file for namecoin domains. Instructions here: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6017.msg97623#msg97623
I don't know much about DNS so avoided modifying or using any existing DNS code. What I have been able to do is get 'dnsmasq' to serve namecoind names using a standard dnsmasq build. eg. try:Code:dig @cd.pn bluishcoder.bitThis seems to work well. What I did was write a small program that does a name_scan and prints out the valid mappings in the same format as /etc/hosts. I then run dnsmasq with the option for obtaining names from this file. I have a script that runs every 5 minutes that rewrites this file and sends a SIGHUP to dnsmasq. The program to generate the hostfile is namecoin-hosts.c. It needs libjansson and libcurl. It can be built with:Code:gcc -o namecoin-hosts namecoin-hosts.c -lcurl -ljanssonThe entries I changed in my dnsmasq.conf were:Code:local=/.bit/local-ttl=300 addn-hosts=/tmp/hosts.txtI have a simple shell script that does the updating:Code:while true; do  ./namecoin-hosts 127.0.0.1:8332 rpcuser rpcpassword >/tmp/hosts.txt  kill -HUP `cat /var/run/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.pid`  echo `date`  sleep 300done You might like to look into #bitcoin-otc - the 'over the counter' marketplace for buying and selling coins. I'd be interested too. Would #bitcoin-otc be a reasonable way of doing the trades? You can make use of the existing trust mechanism for example. I hacked a bit on the polipo HTTP proxy code and added simple namecoin support for DNS lookups. The modified code is in this git repository: https://github.com/doublec/namecoin-polipo. It needs libjansson for JSON parsing and libcurl for talking to the namecoind JSON-RPC server.Once compiled, you can run it passing it the details about the namecoind server:Code:$ git clone https://github.com/doublec/namecoin-polipo$ cd namecoin-polipo$ make$ ./polipo namecoindServer="127.0.0.1:8332" namecoindUsername=rpcuser namecoindPassword=rpcpasswordThis will start the proxy, and it'll connect to the namecoind JSON-RPC server with the given details. It runs 'name_scan' to get the list of names. Any program using this proxy will have all .bit domains resolved by namecoind. Currently it only supports mapping to IP addresses. So namecoind values like the following work: {"map":{"":"192.0.32.10"}}. As an example 'bluishcoder.bit' hopefully resolves to the IP address of my server with my weblog using this version of polipo. It rescans namecoind when a request is made for a domain lookup and the last scan was more than 10 minutes ago.  To use it with Firefox (or other browsers) go into the network settings and set the 'http proxy' to localhost, port 8123.I decided to do this to avoid needing to run the ncproxy script since I don't need socks support. Comments, suggestions, patches are welcome. An option for using socks enabled programs is to use ncproxy combined with SSH. SSH to localhost using the '-D' option to set up a socks proxy.  Code:$ ssh -Dn 2001 user@locahost &$ ncproxy --user=namecoind-user --password=namecoind-password -p 9055 -s 127.0.0.1:2001This sets up ncproxy to forward to the SSH proxy. You can configure firefox to use this socks proxy by going into 'Preferences/Advanced/Network/Settings' and adding '127.0.0.1' and '9055' in the Socks proxy area. You should also go into 'about:config' in Firefox, search for net.proxy.socks_remote_dns and double click on it to set it to true. This will cause DNS requests to go through ncproxy and then the SSH socks proxy.You can also slip polipo in there if you want a web cache. Run:Code:$ ssh -Dn 2001 user@locahost &$ ncproxy --user=namecoind-user --password=namecoind-password -p 9055 -s 127.0.0.1:2001$ ./polipo socksParentProxy=localhost:9055Configure firefox to use the HTTP proxy on port 9055 instead of a socks proxy. These approaches seem to work in that name lookups occur. Unfortunately there appear to  be no namecoin entries with the JSON format to actually see if ncproxy is doing the job. Until a DNS proxy that uses namecoin comes along, one approach to using namecoin for host name lookups could be to provide the option to scan the names every time a block is mined and update/rewrite the users /etc/hosts (or windows equivalent). This might be a quick way of starting to use the namecoin chain for lookups. Even a simple script that does this every 10 minutes or so, getting the names from namecoind via RPC would do a reasonable job.  I added this to puddinpop's code in a branch of my github repository mirroring his code: https://github.com/doublec/bitcoin-pool/tree/lowcpuWith this code 'gethashespersec' will show the total server hash rate. It also adds a command line option '-distributionpercent' allowing the server operator to set the percentage of the generated coins that are available for distribution (the rest go to the server operator). It rounds the generated coin amounts to 3dp as well to help prevent dust accumulation in miners wallets. Feel free to cherry-pick the commits that interest you. I compiled namecoind on linux  by just running 'make'. Not 'make -f makefile.unix' as you'd do to build 'bitcoind'. I also added 'rpcport=...' in the '~/.namecoin/bitcoin.conf' file to set an RPC port that doesn't clash with bitcoind that I have running. Note that the configuration file is still called 'bitcoin.conf' but it lives in '~/.namecoin'. That's true, hopefully people contributing to the bounty put the bitcoins aside now while it's worth less  I have a WP7 which is why I'm asking the questions btw, not trying to put 'stop energy' into the discussion. There's also the fact that Windows Phone 7 doesn't allow background processing or multitasking. Whenever you switch away from the app it stops. You'll have to download newest blocks everytime you start it. Again the november 'mango' update should help with this as some form of background operation is supposed to be available.I don't see any chance of your bounty being claimed if only a completely client side solution is allowed until at least mango becomes available in November-ish (earlier to registered WP7 developers possibly). It's not possible to do a full client on Windows Phone 7 at this stage. The public API's do not include socket access. Only HTTP requests are allowed. A workaround would need to be done whereby it accesses a client or proxy running on a server. Would that be adequate for the bounty?In the upcoming 'mango' update due about November for WP7 it will be possible to do socket level access. I can sell for bank transfer to an NZ account (or trade in person so we don't need escrow depending on where you are). I'd be looking to get around 1.07 NZD per BTC though depending on NZ exchange rate at the time. Look me up on #bitcoin-otc or PM me if you're interested. It looks like at some point your remote machine had a commit that the local or gitorious didn't have. Now every pull from your remote machine is a merge.  I'm not sure what your issue with sgornick's post is. Compute4Cash is a bitcoin pool and they pay to paypal. They are just targeting a different audience than bitcoin users. Yes CoinCard pretty much does this. Firefox does not use a windows service. Are you sure the third party addon starterfox isn't adding one? It'll be more interesting when WebCL becomes available in browsers:http://www.conceivablytech.com/5978/products/webcl-to-enablegpu-accelerated-web-apps It takes quite a while (a few minutes) to stop but it does eventually. I don't know why. Run it with '-no-irc' to prevent it from making an IRC connection. You can also use '-no-listen' to prevent it from listening for incoming connections and use '-connect' to explicitly connect to a node. This minimizes the number of connections to your phone.
It would be good to allow a user to sign the transaction history page, or provide some way for the user to put a signed message there, so that users of the gpg based web of trust in #bitcoin-otc can prove an association between their history on CoinPal and #bitcoin-otc. Great to see a bitcoin implementation developed from scratch! This whois for the domain lists a phone number. His website listed in his github account has a phone number as well. A person with the same name as that listed in the whois has 'liked' the bitcoin facebook page, so someone on facebook could contact him through that maybe.  They are US only, excluding Hawaii and Alaska. I had to remove the -march and SSE stuff from the makefile. I've posted the makefile I used in the other thread. Hope that helps.

I previously wouldn't have had any problem trading on #bitcoin-otc with a stranger for a large number of bitcoins if I was the receiver of the coins as I was under the impression that receiver of bitcoins was safe. I'm more hesitant to do it now that I know there can be issues selling these coins if I don't know the origin which is why I raised the question. Does this mean that bitcoins are now subject to chargebacks just like paypal and credit cards? If I receive bitcoins from a stranger and it turns out some are stolen, I try to sell on mtgox and they are then frozen. Now it seems like a bad idea to trade bitcoins with strangers. Previously it was considered safe to trade if you were on the receiving end of bitcoins. I believe the operator of compute4cash is compute4cash on the forums. Trading on full tilt can be problematic. They are highly aggressive at locking linked accounts if any of the accounts commit some form of transgression. For example, If you transfer on Full Tilt with player A who has in the past transferred with player B (whom you don't know) and B commits fraud then players A and yourself will often have their account locked while it is investigated. You should never trade with unknowns if this risk could be problematic for you (eg. you rely on Full Tilt for income). I think the only open source mining pool server that works with standard getwork clients is jgarzik's pool.py. You can find a link to it in this thread:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3078.0It's not a complete solution in that you'll have to read the code to work out how to use it and set up the database it needs. A non-getwork solution is puddinpop's server and clients:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1458.0This is what I used to run when I was running a pool. It's your reputation that is probably more important since you're paying with a payment system that allows chargebacks. Once the BTC provider sends the bitcoins they can't back out of the deal making their reputation less important (assuming they send first). I've updated the N900 binary to a newer version. I built from gitub commit b1a657. It's available here:http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/bitcoind-b1a657.gzI start it on the N900 using:Code:./bitcoind -noirc -connect=xx.xx.xx.xx -nolistenReplacing 'xx.xx.xx.xx' with a node to connect too. This means no incoming connections will be made to the phone and only one connection is made outgoing. Are you suggesting people would email their paypal password to the coinpal maintainer? I doubt you'd find anyone willing to do this. Won't this just move the problem to clients of the JSON interface? They'll either write their own buggy string to float/float to string implementations or use the one in the programming languages standard library which probably does a lossy conversion. How about providing additional JSON parameters for numerator/denominator so the amount can be expressed accurately as a rational number for those that what the safety. If you don't have jansson installed then the cpuminer build system uses its own source copy of it. Try uninstalling libjansson and reconfiguring/building. Code:minerd --userpass username.minername:minerpassword --url http://mining.bitcoin.cz:8332 --algo 4wayReplace 'username'  with your username on the pool site. Replace 'minername' and 'minerpassword' with the miner's name and password that you registered on the pool site. Replace (or keep) '4way' with whatever algorithm you want ('c', 'cryptopp', cryptopp_asm32', etc). Linux servers get compromised all the time thanks to badly written web applications (just to pick one common vector). If I was a malware author the first servers I'd be targeting would be those offering bitcoin services so I could get access to the wallet. Whatever tool you are using is using the term 'bot' in an odd manner. What tool is it? Correct, I'd rather not have dark pools. Mainly because I don't understand why they exist and it seems harmful to me. It seems to me that the point of a market is to trade the currency with the price reflecting demand. Don't dark pools defeat this?
If the volume is hidden though it discourages me from using the market. If people use the dark pool then the volume on the market always appears low and makes me think there's no trading going on. So I look for a busier market or assume bitcoin is not being traded. I don't understand what the benefit of a dark pool is. Can you explain why someone would use the dark pool? Or why someone wouldn't use the normal pool and should only use the dark pool? This first one: "huesped.name_of_worker:password" Slush's server uses XHTML so document.write won't work. See here:http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#docwrite Did you download it and gunzip it on the phone? I just tried the following steps from the N900 terminal and it worked:Code:$ wget http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/bitcoind.gz$ gunzip bitcoind.gz$ chmod +x bitcoind.gz$ ./bitcoind Trying to run the binaries on Windows it gives an error saying that OpenLDAP.DLL is missing. Should that be included in the .zip file? I'm pretty sure that  cryptopp_asm32 is broken on at least some systems (mine included). It never generates a share. There is some mention of this in the thread about minerd. I stick to the 'C' method or '4way' on compatible hardware. I agree, rounding to 0.01 is the better approach. He has no choice but to wait. The coins aren't available from the generated block until 120 more blocks have passed. This is enforced by the network and software. He can't send the coins out before this. Same here. My reward is over the threshold of 0.01 but nothing sent. It might be a good idea not to call it 'difficulty' on the webpage... I got the error you got when I had the wrong username/password. Yes, I guess the difficulty calculator I used must be incorrect. Any idea what the estimate would be? Found it, '32' according if it's the listed difficulty under each registered miner. So that's about 19 hours for a share using a 2,000 khash/s machine (my estimate of an average dual core laptop). The instructions say to use one registered miner for each remote miner instance connected. Does this mean multithreaded miners need to be limited to 1 thread only? Will running them with multiple threads confuse the share algorithm? What's the current difficulty value for miners to get a share?  Why so few payouts and they don't add up to 50? Are there a lot of entrants that have a minimum amount to send set so their balance is accumulating? Edit CMakeCache.txt. Change the line that references libdb.so to libdb_cxx.so. Is the source for your cooperative miner available? I'm keeping my server running until it generates a block so the people who've contributed hashes for the last couple of days haven't wasted their time. Hopefully not too many people will switch before that happens otherwise it'll be forever before it generates.I'll update the bitcoin-pool page with the new IP address and a note that someone else is running it when that happens.
I have no problems with rooms charging rake either. They've got to pay the bills somehow. World Sports Exchange had a rake free room but it failed. Any thoughts on how you expect to fund things? Unfortunately running the pooled server is proving too taxing for my VPS host. They keep killing the server due to using too much CPU. sjaak on IRC has offered to host a server on 91.121.29.91 that runs full time on a dedicated machine (rather than a VPS). If sjaak posts here to confirm the offer I plan to turn my server off when it generates the next block (so all the existing contributers haven't wasted their time since the last block). sjaak's new server is currently running if you want to start using it now. I saw nothing obvious in the debugger. It still seemed to be stepping through the clients ok. Is it possible for a slow or malicious client to cause the server to block or slow down?I should have enough bandwidth. I have a similar server that serves a lot more traffic than this one running the pooled miner. That said my host has been killing the server for excessive CPU usage recently so anything is possible.Is anyone else willing to run/take over running the pool that might have a more reliable server or connection? I added a warning to the pool page.  It isn't so. They are definitely 'generated'. If you look at the block you'll see the one generation block is split amongst all the addresses: http://blockexplorer.com/b/97017. Each of those addresses will have a 'Generated' transaction. So it was a MyBitcoin address? I wonder if anyone else used a MyBitcoin address and if they got their coins too?The generated transactions appear differently in clients. They show as 'Generated' and don't become usable for 120 blocks. Non-gui clients can't even see them or access them in any way using bitcoind until that 120 block period has passed. Possibly something in the way MyBitcoin is setup stopped them from picking up that you got coins?Have you tried contacting them? When did you contribute? Did you stop at any time? For the first few days the server was running the connected method, not contributed due to bugs in the later as described here: http://pastecoin.com/download.php?file=70Is the address you listed appearing in the block as shown in block explorer? The server got stuck idling and producing zero hashes again. I've temporarily fallen back to the previous server, version 1.2.1, until the problem is resolved. Note that 1.2.1 is averaging about 60% the CPU usage of 1.2.2. puddinpop, some timestats.txt for the last few hours:Code:section count timeBitcoinMinerRemote Handling Messages 3538540 6125980632BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::AddDistributionFromContributed 7444 12161303BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::BlockToJson 7444 37761410BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::DecodeBase64 1137964 7965160BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::EncodeBase64 14888 110513BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::GetAllClientsCalculatedKHashFromBest 990 12888072BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::GetAllClientsCalculatedKHashFromMeta 990 5102865BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::GetOldestNonVerifiedMetaHashClient 1684875 13319578BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::SendWork 7444 218351595BitcoinMinerRemoteServer::Step 3538541 1986327641MetaHashVerifier::Start 398 112139MetaHashVerifier::Step 78488 1280946445RemoteClientConnection::GetCalculatedKHashRateFromBestHash 104395 12802790RemoteClientConnection::GetCalculatedKHashRateFromMetaHash 104395 5005396RemoteClientConnection::GetNewestSentWorkWithMetaHash 1606785 8341113RemoteClientConnection::GetSentWorkByID 1137964 3100622RemoteClientConnection::MessageReady 327210958 585449940RemoteClientConnection::ProtocolError 327210958 575656559RemoteClientConnection::ReceiveMessage 1140525 300611249RemoteClientConnection::SendMessage 20680 17677026RemoteClientConnection::SetWorkVerified 384 1151RemoteClientConnection::SocketReceive 753356 11741667RemoteClientConnection::SocketSend 19110 1143503950VerifyBestHash 1001002 6195863 The server got stuck in an idle state again. It was using 0% CPU and not processing requests. I'm building in debug mode now and I'll attach with a debugger if it happens again. Something odd happened with the server. I noticed it was using 0 CPU as if no clients were connected. I connected a miner and I just got this repeated:Code:Requesting a new block 1292156535151Requesting a new block 1292156540258Requesting a new block 1292156545364So it was constantly 'requesting a new block'. Any thoughts on what might cause this? I restarted the server and the miner connected and worked fine. Is it possible that the new server code uses more CPU? Prior to the update I was averaging 60%, now it's 95%. It's hard to tell if it's because of more clients suddenly joining or the update (about 10 new clients joined). Maybe they're OpenCL clients and the server is just busier. It'd be great if the server could have stats about number of OpenCL, Cuda and CPU clients are connected. I've updated to puddinpop's latest server code. There is also a new client. The new client displays the distribution method the server is using, can use multiple threads (no more needing to run multiple instances of the miner), and no longer dumps the 'best hash rate' to the console. There is also a new OpenCL remote miner:http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool In the debug.log I get lines like this a lot (tens of thousands of lines) from some IP addresses:Code:Client x.x.x.x sent metahash for block we don't know about!What causes this? Note that this is with the 20101206 release. cmake-bitcoinr/CMakeLists.txt seems to be missing a line for remoteminerthreadcpu.cpp. There's a link error unless I add this. It's because the block hasn't matured yet. It should display the amount after that. I'll update the server I run today and post some stats when it's been running for a while. As Theymos said, it definitely does show up as generated on all clients that participated. Do any of the address with amounts less than 0.01 in this block look familiar?http://blockexplorer.com/b/97017 Did you use the pool mining service at all? If so your share of contributions may be less than 0.01 and the bitcoin client is displaying it as 0.00 due to rounding. A new block was generated by the pool today. The total amounts distributed in the recently generated block can be seen here: http://blockexplorer.com/b/97017
The very small divisions could get a bit annoying though. Some people have asked if it's worth rounding to 0.01 so people don't have odd amounts stuck in their wallets. On the other hand if they stay in the pool for a while these will add it. New block generated by the pool:http://blockexplorer.com/block/000000000004c6f77930f9dbaf8f424723da3f832af9063d628946565b82d657 It's in the very first post of the thread, at the top, where it says "Newest binary". The server saves the number of hashes on exit and reloads it on restart. If you think there are issues with the way things are calculated you should post in the Pooled/Remote Mining thread so the author of the code can respond:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1458.0 The server is running the contributed method. This means each user gets a portion based on the actual number of hashes contributed. So if the pool was running for 2 days and your miners have only been running for 12 hours then you haven't contributed anywhere near the number of hashes as your percentage of the current hash value of the pool. You should be seeing the amount of BTC you would earn slowly increasing over time if you joined the pool recently. It's linked from my pooled mining page. First post here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1458.0 For the majority of the time the pool was operating at less than 100,000 khash/s. It's normal that no blocks have been mined recently. It'll happen given time.It doesn't matter whether the server is running a CPU or a GPU. It doesn't do any mining so it doesn't use any GPU code.  That said there's nothing stopping you from running your own pool of course on a beefier server. Go for it! I considered doing this but ended up taking the easy path of just distributing puddinpop's binaries directly. It wouldn't be hard to make the CPU miner easier but the GPU one is problematic since it's very dependent on what hardware the user has. If someone puts together a friendlier installer I'd be more than happy to use it. What advice would you give to make getting it running simpler? I'm not too concerned about getting lots of people. The server is running close to capacity already. I'd investigate ways of setting up fallback servers, or handling load, but the cost of running one server is already expensive given the pool makes no money itself. I'm only running this as a service for those who want to try puddinpop's code at this stage. Yep, the server program exited overnight - not sure why. I've restarted it. Fedora used to configure openssl so ecdsa is not included:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=319901Possibly they still do. Do you have the libssl development files installed? On a debian based system this is libssl-dev. Ah, I didn't realise double tapping the address would select it. I was using the swype from left to right gesture, clicking the mouse pointer that appears, click and dragging the selection area then control-C, etc. The double-tap is much faster. I received the .61 on the N900, thanks! Yes, the N900 does have copy and paste although it can be a pain to get exactly the right area to copy in the browser. I need a good way of getting addresses onto the phone. So if I see an address on a web page, or printed out, how to get this on the phone easily so I can send to it. Barcodes were discussed in the android thread so that's a possibility I guess. If you use the 'Desktop Command Execution' widget you can execute bitcoind RPC commands and have the result displayed on the desktop in a widget. So I have my current balance in a widget on the desktop on my phone. Successfully received on my phone, thanks!I think you're right about the writing of the block chain to flash memory. There's also the debug log which is very chatty. See ~/.bitcoin/debug.log. We'd probably want to turn that off on the phone. I've been running bitcoind all day on the N900 and the battery hit has been minimal. There seems to be little overhead if I'm already running the IM protocols (Skype, GTalk, etc).  Thanks, I've switched and it looks like it's working fine. The same way I deal with it on my laptop. Encrypted filesystem. I'm hoping the battery life for just running the client (ie. not generating) won't be too bad. I run skype constantly to receive calls via a skype number and gtalk most of the time. They require a constant connection and I get a days usage out of the phone.I use the built in XTerm to get terminal access and run bitcoind manually to do stuff. A JSON-RPC frontend for it wouldn't be too difficult - assuming the bitcoind RPC interface exposes enough information.
I created 18T1jQ9QT1fsDJ7q8YKBGhdM56iYt4sXoV on my phone. I'm interested in what the battery hit is like for running it full time. It did take a *long* time to get the block chain. I get between 130 and 150 khash/s when I did a short generation test run.  It's picking up old boost libraries and/or headers. I had this issue too. I hardcoded the makefile to pick the boost stuff I wanted. Does this require remote miner clients to update as well? Or is it just the server? I got bitcoind running on the N900. It wasn't too hard. I had to build the right versions of libdb and libboost and make one minor change to util.cpp. The ParseHex function in util.cpp has code like:Code:if (c == -1) 'c' is a 'char' type which is unsigned so this comparison never does what's expected. Changing both instances of this to the following gets a working bitcoind:Code:if (c == (char)-1)Where 'working' means it's currently downloading the block chain. I  haven't extensively tested it yet. Binary here if anyone wants to risk it:http://bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/bitcoind.gzgunzip it and run it from the terminal. The standard RPC commands will work with it running. Update: 2010-02-04: The changes to ParseHex are no longer needed as they're part of the bitcoin source now. An updated build for the N900 is available here:http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/bitcoind-b1a657.gzThis is built from github commit b1a657. Yes, except replace 'bitcoinr' with 'remoteminer-cpu.exe' or 'remoteminer-cuda.exe'. replace src/remote/remotebitcoinheaders.h with http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/remotebitcoinheaders.h and see how that goes. You should install libboost-all-dev. To run a server on linux:Code:bitcoind -remoteserver -remotebindaddr=0.0.0.0 -remotebindport=8335 -genNote the 'remotebindaddr'. This is what makes the server accessible over the internet by other clients.To run clients:Code:bitcoinr -server=ip.addr.of.server -address=bitcoinaddress Are you using the new pooled client? The old one won't work:http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/ I added a call to SetLastVerifiedMetaHash but that didn't fix the issue for the contributed distributed type. So I've switched back to 'connected' and this displays the address as being in the pool.I'll switch back to 'contributed' if the issue is resolved. I fixed what looks like one bug in the best hash verification but it didn't solve this issue. I've switched back to the 'connected' distribution type and that is now printing things correctly. I'll wait till I hear from puddinpop before switching back to contributed and trying to solve the issue. puddinpop, there appears to be no call to SetLastVerifiedMetaHash in the current code, whereas there is in the last version. Is this a bug?  There might be some server up and down-age as I add some debugging to investigate this. Clients should reconnect gracefully. Don't panic if you see it  If there were 100 cuda clients in the pool we'd get a block every 5 hours or so. There are no failed hashes in the log. But there only seems to be one client passing: If I grep the log for "passed metahash" all I see is one client IP address listed. There are 16 clients connected to the server. Why is it bad? I asked before switching and the majority of the responses requested contributed. puddinpop noted to expect this: I've noticed this too. I asked puddinpop about it in the other thread. puddinpop, when running this latest version I'm always seeing a message on the remote client saying that my address is not found in the block being solved. It doesn't show the share that I'd get that it used to. Is something broken or is there a change in the behaviour? I updated the server on 173.255.205.10 early since there were only 4 clients connected. Instructions updated here:http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/Basically you need the new client binary. The windows version is now called remoteminer-cpu.exe and the arguments to it require '=' instead of a space between the '-address' and its value (and '-server' and its value).There's also a remoteminer-cuda.exe for those with a cuda compatible GPU.Let see how well this handles load. If it's fine I'll take down the other server.

I've also added it to my git repository in the 'bitcoin-remote-20101205' branch:https://github.com/doublec/bitcoin-poolI've just pushed to master the tweaks to build the miner only code on linux. I plan to switch the pool to puddinpop's latest server version at 5:00 am Monday 6 December UTC. That's 5 hours from the time I posted this. This will require contributors to update the miner software. I'll post here when the switch is done. The server will use the 'contributed' method.

I'll post here when the switch is done. The server will use the 'contributed' method. I've temporarily hacked in a hard coded limit of 102 clients. Any connects after that will fail. Unfortunately no message is printed to the client and it immediately retries but it beats the server crashing. puddinpop, it'd be great to have a way to set a maximum number of clients and maybe have a message printed to the client trying to connect if that is exceeded. Any thoughts on how to decrease the CPU usage of the server? Yes, most likely. As a quick workaround I've brought a second server online. If the number of clients on one is greater than 100 I suggest connecting to the second instead. The second server is at IP address 173.255.205.10 so the client command is:remoteminer.exe -server 173.255.205.10 -address abitcoinaddressWith 100 on each this will handle current load until I look into the issue. Yep, server died again. I'm looking into it. The server stopped for some reason. I've restarted it.The khash rate seems to be oscillating for me. It reports 400 khash/s then the next report it's 1600. The average of those 2 is 1,000 which is the normal rate for my cpu. Odd. The total combined khash rate is also oscillating. I think the server is overloaded. It's pegged at a 100% CPU right now with 143 clients. It's running on a linode VPS [1] so is a virtual linux instance sharing resources on a machine with other virtual linux instances.[1] http://www.linode.com For those not following the other thread, the pool generated its first block today:http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000233334b157d901714baf59e5b9236227b2878844e52244da4195e Yes, this is interesting. My server is suffering quite a bit of load. It's sitting at 80%-100% CPU utilization with 120 clients. I don't know if this would affect the rate. Possibly someone is connecting and attempting to cheat?Sometime next weeks I plan to move to puddinpop's latest code and binary drop. This will mean a complete restart of the pool and the chance to move to the 'contributed' distribution method. see the first post here under 'distribution type': http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1458.msg16906#msg16906What are pool contributors thoughts? Change to this method? I might also move to a beefier server. If this information was provided by the client and/or server I'd be happy to publish it. As far as I know, it isn't. When a block is generated hopefully people will post here confirming they received coins. The khash/s value is per instance. The estimate on how many bitcoins you'll receive is per address. I will most likely be doing this after the weekend sometime. I'll post a more exact date/time later.I've been requested to set up a git repository with changes specific to getting the remote miner compiled on linux. I've done this and it's at: https://github.com/doublec/bitcoin-poolThe 'master' branch should build the remote miner only on linux by running cmake followed by make. The 'bitcoin-remote-20101201' branch contains the source originally from puddinpop for that version with no changes. You can get a diff to see my (minor) changes to get things to build by diffing these two branches. There's also a roulette:http://cashcow.no-op.orgAnd poker:http://betco.inLegality depends a lot on what country and what laws around gambling they have. Someone commented on the webpage for the pool that they are burning in 2 24 core servers using the remote miner. So that counts for 48 of the clients. If you're on windows it's 'remoteminer.exe' instead of 'bitcoinr'. Did you follow these steps from david's post?The 'connecting to 127.0.0.1' message your getting suggests that the '-server 69.164.214.82' part is missing from the shortcut. What linux distro? Looks like cmake or gcc or some other dependency is broken. They package libdb's C++ support separately:sudo apt-get install libdb4.8++-dev
This is the exact file I'm using:http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/remotebitcoinheaders.h Delete all the #include "../" include's in src/remote/remotebitcoinminer.h. Replace with one include: #include "../headers.h". That works for me. Yes but you'd be on the hook for any fraud that that someone committed. To get the card you need to send photo ID. epassporte had the same requirement and so do similar services (Neteller, etc). Some changes I had to make to the latest source to get building on Linux:1. I had to add the following lines to the end of cmake-bitcoinr/CMakeLists.txtIF(NOT WIN32)   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(bitcoinr pthread)ENDIF(NOT WIN32)It needed pthread to link on Linux. I made it 'NOT WIN32' in case it's needed on Mac too.2. In src/remote/remotebitcoinheaders.h, removed the "../blah.h" includes and replaced them all with a single:#include "../headers.h"This got things included in the right order. Not sure if that's the optimal fix. Just a heads up - I've updated the server to the latest version of puddinpop's code. Existing running clients will have disconnected for a short time and should have automatically reconnected. To get the benefits of the new server you should update your remote mining client to the latest version. I've updated the pool page with this:http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/One of the nice features of the new client is it tells you how many blocks the server has generated, and how many coins you'd earn based on your hash rate if the server were to generate a block. Also, less bandwidth utilization! I'm definitely interested in seeing a version of your CPU miner that works against the pooled server. If someone else doesn't get to it I'll try and see what's involved in a few days. Thanks, I've updated the my pool server to use this. I like the extra information the remote client shows! I'll be keeping it going as long as puddinpop doesn't mind the use of his code. I'll keep updating the page on my site when things change. If anything it's an interesting experiment in how workable pooled mining is.puddinpop updated new versions of the software so at some point I'll have to bring the server down and start the new version. This means all currently connected clients will be disconnected for a bit. I don't know if it automatically reconnects or if they have to be restarted. I updated the instructions to include this step:Overwrite the $SOURCEDIR/src/remote/remotebitcoinheaders.h with http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/remotebitcoinheaders.hIt changes the include files so compilation works. What happens to the existing label functionality? I have a webapp that uses a label to get an address then uses the address. Will this still work or will I have to change the app to use accounts? The problem is you need an address to have coins sent back to you. I guess you could have a client that ran, prompted for the address, then connected to the hardcoded server. Is that what you mean? I've started a pooled mining server using puddinpop's remote mining version of bitcoin being discussed in the technical forum: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1458.0Due to high difficulty levels it will take a long time for a CPU based miner to generate a block and get 50 coins. By joining in the pooled effort you combine your efforts with everyone else in the pool. The server ensures everyone is working cooperatively so the average time to generate the coins for the entire pool is based on the sum of their hash values. The pool server then distributes the 50 coins based on the contributions of the people in the pool. See the technical thread for more details. I've put a page up containing the latest version of puddinpop's software and instructions on how to connect to my server: http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/There is currently no version of the miner for GPU's but hopefully one will be available soon. Currently there are 26 clients with a combined khash of 25,000. I started a webpage with details: http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/I'll start a thread once I've got the GPU situation and/or some linux binaries sorted. Actually probably better just to  a thread. Thread here: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2027.0 Unfortunately it seems there's no GPU enabled remote miner client. What is your GPU setup? CUDA or OpenCL? Windows, Linux or Mac? I'm fine with keeping it running. It runs on a VPS which isn't doing much else. I'll be monitoring the CPU usage and bandwidth but it looks like it doesn't use much. @davidonpda, I ran it previously but stopped since no one was using it and the client got outdated. I restarted it with puddinpop's recent version yesterday when I posted the IP address. The number of clients, as bober182 noted, has ranged from 2 to 10. What's needed is a larger number of people to contribute (and hopefully someone with a GPU) so that the lesser powered CPU clients can start getting some benefit from being involved.I'm not sure if that will happen though as the GPU clients are probably more likely to want to keep mining for themselves. puddinpop, there seems to be a typo in cmake-bitcoinr/CMakeList.txt. The references to 'bitcoind' in TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES should be 'bitcoinr'. Yes each instance of remoteminer only uses one core. The idea (I assume) is to run multiple instances for each core. It will always be a little slower than the normal client due to the communication overhead of talking to the remote server. It should work on guest accounts and the 50BC is split based on the khash contributed to the solution of each connected miner. puddinpop will be able to explain more on this since they wrote the code. I'll try and get a GPU miner connected to up the khash rate soon. I have a server running you can connect to if you want to test it out. You can connect to it using the windows binaries in the original post. See http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/ for IP address and other details.
