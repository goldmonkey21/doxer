We've had no DDoS related problems since August - not sure why this keeps coming up.Teppy Yes, Dragon's Tale is a gambling MMORPG with native 3D clients available for Windows, OSX and Linux.Also, we're having a bonus freeroll at 4:00 EDT today, fireworks based. It's not a "pure" freeroll because some of the prize pools only qualify with larger bet amounts; most of the tournaments I listed above are pure freerolls. I'm trying an event unlike anything I've ever run in Dragon's Tale - an entire month of (mostly freerolls) Tournaments, 3 per day (Noon, 8:00PM, 4:00 AM EDT), with a different game each day of the week. It all kicks off tomorrow at Noon EDT.Saturday: Fireworks (65 BTM)Sunday: Shrines (35 BTM)Monday: Zhanlue (21 BTM)Tuesday: Pyramid of the Orient (50 BTM)Wednesday: Skill-based Fishing (30 BTM)Thursday: Tug (21 BTM)Friday: Silly Monkey (40 BTM)Each Tournament is repeated three times on it's day, so that all time zones have a (somewhat) convenient time to play: 12:00 Noon EDT, 8:00 PM EDT, 4:00 AM EDT.Dragon's Tale has a number of faucet-like mini-games within, which give enough free Bitcoin to play in all of these tournaments. There are no restrictions on withdrawals aside from a 1 BTM minimum to avoid dust, and no deposit or playthrough requirements, Of course I hope that lots of new players will discover the game and go on to deposit, but this is a way to get a truly free look at the oldest Bitcoin community aside from Bitcointalk.org itself.Andrew TepperDeveloper, Dragon's Tale Just confirming that we've been suffering a DDoS attack for most of the day. I will continue to work to get the game back up in the morning.Teppy ("Di") I've added a bunch more Zhanlue tables: Two additional on Xinren Tang, two on Zhifu (though those are 1 BTM stakes), and one on each of the four Governed Islands.Teppy Ok, the Tournament is launched. It's again a freeroll meaning that the cost to enter/play is well under the amounts of free Bitcoins that you can get for free in the game. (Dragon's Tale doesn't support zero-bets, so I just set the cost-to-play to be arbitrarily small, in this case 1000 SAT per game.)I've broken it up into 3 tournaments, 8 hours apart, each with 350 BTM in prizes. Each will be 8 hours after the previous one, so that people in various time zones can participate.The first will start at 8:00PM EDT (8.5 hours from now.), then the next one at 4:00AM EDT tomorrow, then the third one at Noon EDT tomorrow. You can participate in multiple tournaments, but may not play in one tournament with multiple characters.Glad to answer any questions about Zhanlue. Wiki entry is here: http://www.dragons.tl/mediawiki-1.16.5/index.php/ZhanlueTeppy Yes, there will be a second 1 BTC Tournament like I promised, starting later today.However, I think that instead of Tug I'm going to use the newest PvP game, "Zhanlue," which is a simultaneous-play version of Connect-Four. It was released last week. Everyone did make their accounts already, right?I'll configure things later today and announce the times and how prizes will be distributed.I'll run a third 1 BTC Tournament when Bitcoins hit $1000.Teppy ("Di") Here are the tournament results. I'll give them exactly as the game reports them, and then explain what everything means below.-------------------------------------Results for $574 Bitcoin Tug TournamentFor Tug:    For the BTC 1 Power-8 at 1/2 pool by Full Rank:        IcePick won BTM 502        Willem won BTM 188        deviant won BTM 188        shinjo won BTM 36.66        Joes won BTM 36.66        CryptoCuz won BTM 36.66        jhackers won BTM 2        Glutton won BTM 2        tonyjung won BTM 2        Kjell won BTM 2        KriZ won BTM 2-------------------------------------Ok, so first off, it lists the "Game Set" which in this case is Tug. (Sometimes a Tournament has multiple Game Sets, but this one had just one, and that consisted of only a single game type, Tug.)It then describes a "Prize Hopper" and a "Distribution Mechanism." In this case the Prize Hopper held 1 BTC, which in Dragon's Tale terminology can also be expressed as "1000 BTM." The Distribution Mechanism was Power-8 at 1/2 by Full Rank. Power says to distribute the most to whoever came in first, and then a fraction of that amount to 2nd place, and then a fraction of the 2nd place amount to 3rd place, etc. The fraction used in this case is the "1/2." Power-8 says to try to make the distribution to 8 players, though in the case of a tie that number can increase. As long as at least 8 players participated and had some sort of win, it won't decrease.First place got about half a Bitcoin as expected. There was a tie for 2nd and 3rd places, so the system pools those prize amounts (about 250 BTM + 125 BTM = 375 BTM) and splits that total among those that tied for 2nd.  Same with 4th, 5th and 6th places. Finally, there was a 5-way tie for 7th, so it takes the prizes for 7th and 8th place, sums them, and splits that among all 5 people that tied for 7th. Finally, it normalizes all those amounts to add up to 1 BTM, which is why first place got 502 BTM instead of 500 BTM. Decimal values less than 1 BTM are not shown above, but the total amount distributed was within a few satoshis of 1 BTC.57 people participated in the tournament, and 10 of those got prizes. I recognize most of the names above, but not all, so I hope that at least some of the prize money went to new players. I had a great time running this tournament - I'd like to do more of these! If we did the next one when we hit $700, would that give everyone enough time to learn Tug?Teppy $574.43 on CoinDesk - I have triggered the tournament; it will start in 45 minutes and last 4 hours. Anyone can feel free to post leaderboard updates in this thread. (I will too if I can, but I have family commitments in about an hour.)Teppy Dragon's Tale is a 3D world: There is a tournament board on Xinren Tang (the beginner island) - when the price hits $574 I will trigger the tournament. You click on the board to sign up, and then just play others in Tug. You'll see a current leaderboard as you play. (I realize that all of this can be a bit overwhelming if you haven't been in the game yet, but any of the other players can get you up to speed quickly.)Teppy Yes, creating a new account is fine for the tournament, but just a single account per player.Teppy Here at the eGenesis office we have a good bottle of champagne ready to go if Bitcoin hits $574, half of it's all-time high. I'd like to extend the celebration into the virtual world by giving away 1 BTC if that happens. I'll do this in the form of a Tug tournament with several winners splitting the 1 BTC prize. The tournament will have no entry fee. We'll use the current price as reported by Coindesk to determine when the event launches.Tug is a 2-player strategy game that takes a few minutes to learn - there are plenty of players online that would be glad to show how it works.I believe that Dragon's Tale is the longest-running Bitcoin business in the world, in continuous operation since October of 2010. (See posts on this forum to verify that.)Teppy If you're having trouble connecting, try the "UDP Mode" option. We've been having sporadic connectivity problems, usually for just a few minutes at a time, which is making it hard for the ISP to figure out what's going on. They're working on it though.Teppy I don't know of an easy way to check, but addresses certainly are reused, even though doing so is not the best practice. Does anyone know what percentage of addresses in (say) recent blocks have already been seen once before on the blockchain? What if, for the special case of an address already seen on the blockchain, it could be referenced by "The nth address on the blockchain" rather than the full address? N could be a 32 (40? 48?) bit number. Is this essentially what "Segregated Witness" does? If the person accusing me of unfair banning is the character "VIP," then I banned him (the only person I have banned recently) for demanding kickbacks from new players in order to receive mineral waters.The game distributes mineral waters to higher ranking players with the understanding that they give them to new players so that they may try the game. After receiving complaints from others in the game that VIP had demanded payment for mineral waters , I verified those accusations using the chat logs on the server, and told VIP that that behavior was not allowed, and that this was his only/final warning.He again contacted a number of new players, again demanding money in exchange for mineral waters. So he and his various mule characters have been banned from Dragon's Tale. Also, I do have the blocks and chainstate directories backed up as of a month ago. Would replacing the current directories (and only those two directories) with the backups be safe? I've tried restarting with --rescan, but get this:2015-11-30 13:34:22 Verifying last 288 blocks at level 32015-11-30 13:34:22 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : added transaction mismatch? database corrupted2015-11-30 13:34:24 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : added transaction mismatch? database corrupted2015-11-30 13:34:24 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : added transaction mismatch? database corrupted2015-11-30 13:34:27 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : added transaction mismatch? database corrupted2015-11-30 13:34:28 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : undo data overwriting existing transaction2015-11-30 13:34:29 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : added transaction mismatch? database corrupted2015-11-30 13:34:30 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : added transaction mismatch? database corrupted2015-11-30 13:35:27 ERROR: VerifyDB() : *** coin database inconsistencies found (last 7 blocks, 106434 good transactions before that)2015-11-30 13:35:29 : Corrupted block database detected.The last time I had to do a --reindex it took 4-5 days to complete, and that's a long time to be down. Any other options? Should --reindex take that long? It's on the blockchain - the winner can identify the tx if he chooses.Teppy That was in early March of 2011 - Bitcoins were worth less than $0.50 at the time, so his 800 BTC win was only worth about $400 at the time.Teppy
The withdraw actually depleted the hot wallet last night, so the tx will show once I get in to the office this morning. (Several other players had significant wins yesterday as well.)But yes, the win was real - a 0.6 BTC bet on a grave that paid 88x.Dragon's Tale is (AFAIK) the longest running Bitcoin enterprise in the world. We've been in continuous operation since October 2010 back when Bitcoins were worth pennies each - we have reserves to cover bets far higher than this.Teppy Just letting everyone know that the server is down right now, might be a few hours until we're back up. I'm seeing a sort of "soft crash" where things slow down dramatically, and rather than take it down and restart it, I want to analyze how it got into this state (taking it down and restarting would destroy that information.)Teppy I have just released a new series of Tournaments specifically to teach new players about Dragon's Tale.You'll be able to play three games: Silly Monkey, Shrines, and Drinking. There are prizes for having the greatest overall winnings on Shrines, the highest single jackpots in Drinking, and the greatest winnings and highest individual jackpots in Silly Monkey.Each of the 90 tournaments (one every 8 hours, for the next month) has 18 BTM (0.018) in prizes. To make these "free," I've limited the bets to a cumulative 0.1 BTM per player per tournament, which is an amount that you can easily get for free within Dragon's Tale itself, with a bit of exploration. You can search Soldiers, scout Herbs, quaff Mineral Waters, or even make friends with established Dragon's Tale players (many of whom will gift 0.1 BTM to a friendly new player.)Glad to answer any questions about these new tournaments.Teppy By special arrangement, yes, we can handle even larger bets. In the past I've done this specifically for Wishing Wells, though never to accommodate something as high at a 4000 BTC jackpot. If you're really serious about gambling at this level, contact me in-game and I may be able to arrange that.Wishing Wells is actually an unusual case because it is (debatably) a strategy game where the player is still able to pick their bet level: The maximum jackpot on a given well is intentionally kept secret from the player; dynamically changing the menu would leak this information.  There's a maximum jackpot amount that varies as people play. Right now, Dragon's Tale can pay jackpots of up to ~600 BTC, and the game will only accept bets that have a theoretical max jackpot of whatever this number is. That could be a bet for 6 BTC that pays up to 100:1, or a bet for 100 Bitcoins that pays up to 6:1. Yesterday afternoon Aston won 124 Bitcoins on a single bet. He wagered 3 BTC on an approximately 41:1 monkey maze tile which hit - that's the highest USD value jackpot in Dragon's Tale's nearly 5 year history, worth about $34,000. Previously we've had at least one $25,000 value jackpot, which was higher in numbers of Bitcoins (I think it was in the days of $12 Bitcoins. Jase, if you're still around, care to confirm?)I'm hoping someone has videos of the subsequent after-parties - if so, please post here! I have never seen so many cigars, drinks, rounds of shots and festival boxes happen in one day.Anyone care to try to break this new record?? So if I'm understand this correctly, a miner's profit using the outlined attack is as follows. Note that currently no transaction fees are "burned" - miners keep all of them.L=Share of legitimate transactionsH=Share of hashing amount that the attacker controlsB=Share of the fees that must be burnedProfit=(L*H*(1-B))-(1-L)*(1-H)Suppose there was a change to the Bitcoin protocol as follows: Every newly mined block must send half the transaction fees to a "burn" address. So we'll increase B from 0 (current protocol) to 1/2:Under the original example L=2/3, H=1/2, B=0 and so Profit=1/6Under the proposed change L=2/3, H=1/2, B=1/2 and so Profit=0However, as L approaches 1 it doesn't matter how high you set B to, there is still profit to be extracted from this attack.Setting B=0.5 protects the network from attacks where L<2/3, whereas before the network was only safe where L<1/2, so it's an improvement, but not the final solution.Thoughts? I don't recall letting a Level 3 player on to Tiki - do you remember who it was? (Not saying that didn't make some exception for some reason, I just don't recall doing that.)Teppy I have a radically new idea, would like to discuss with anyone that does not care for the "no splits allowed" proposal. Call me at 412-973-7914. If I don't answer it's because I'm already taking to someone else.Teppy The explanation above wasn't quite right; we have several machines that serve resources; one of them had an old file on it that pointed to a different compute server.Everything is now running smoothly- sorry for the downtime.Teppy The server that checks the client version and updates it (and serves all the graphics resources) is down, and I can't ping it. Trying to figure out what's going on - if the machine is dead, then we do have spare machines; working on a fix now. Once I know the cause, I'll update here with an ETA.Teppy Dragon's Tale is an MMORPG where the content is almost entirely gambling instead of, say, combat. You level up by completing gambling quests, explore to unlock new gambling games, compete in (and even organize) gambling tournaments with interesting rules.Every 3D object in the world is a novel gambling game, 68 different types so far, many with variations.Teppy I've just released the first version of Mineral Waters, a new game in Dragon's Tale where veteran players place "bets" on new players.If you enter the game as a new player and interact with existing players, there is a very good chance that you will be gifted some Mineral Waters. These are special drinks that cost the provider nothing, but pay off in Bitcoin to the one receiving them. Veteran players get several each day to distribute as they see fit.Each time a veteran player gives you a Mineral Water, they're betting that you will eventually do a certain amount of gambling in the game. If they're accurate, they can win in-game and real-life prizes.The Bitcoins in the drink are provided by the house: We're placing a bet that you'll love Dragon's Tale and  join our little community. We've been in continuous operation since October 2010, and are, I believe, the longest running Bitcoin based business in the world. Native clients for Windows, Linux and OSX are available on http://www.dragons.tl I'm planning to do a Q&A session in IRC about the motivations behind PS Coin, a new market that I have recently launched (currently in alpha at http://www.pscoin.com)As some of you know, I am the designer of Dragon's Tale, which is (I believe) the longest-running Bitcoin based business in the world, in continuous operation since October 2010.This market puts a new twist on commissions, that should eliminate high-frequency trading, and create a truly deep and stable market.Time: Friday, 2/27/2015 at 11:00 AM ESTServer: irc.freenode.netChannel: #bitcoin-otcTeppy I believe we're currently the longest running Bitcoin business in the world. Anyone know of one that has been in continuous operation for longer?Teppy Some of you know me as the designer of the gambling MMO Dragon's Tale, which I believe to be the longest-running Bitcoin based business in the world. I'm posting to announce a new venture that I have started.--------------------------------------------Pittsburgh, PA - PS Coin today is pleased to launch the first correctly incentivized market on www.pscoin.com. The unique PS Coin market algorithm encourages "healthy" behavior among traders in a market by awarding limit orders with royalties relative to their participation in helping produce a deep, dense, and stable market. Traders are automatically compensated for placing orders for as many units of currency as they can, as close to the bid-ask-spread as they dare, for having those orders sit there for a long time accumulating royalties, and then eventually having their orders trade. As a result of our incentive algorithm, all of the bids and asks you will see on the PS Coin markets are very likely to remain there. It's not an illusion of stability, as traders have come to experience many times in traditional markets. It's actual stability.You are encouraged to watch our video for a detailed explanation of how the PS Coin algorithm works, by the conceiver of the algorithm himself and co-founder of PS Coin, Andrew Tepper: https://youtu.be/dLqhMIksOjUPS Coin's engineering team has spent over a year in development, with the goal of building the most secure and most powerful exchange possible.Security:The majority of all funds which will be deposited to the PS Coin exchange are stored offline in bank vaults. For the rest, we have sought the expertise of cryptographers and decorated cybersecurity experts to design and engineer software security systems that far exceed industry standards for excellence. Because we can't accurately condense all of the information into this press release, you are encouraged to read more about how we will protect your funds on our security page: https://pscoin.com/Security/Performance:The PS Coin incentivized trading engine has to do a bit more work than standard exchanges, because it must process accumulation and capture of royalties for every order. Yet our C++ based engine can handle about 500,000 new orders per-second on a single commodity server.Experience:PS Coin engineers have extensive experience in the crypto-currency space. Co-founder Andrew Tepper is also the founder of eGenesis, the 14th company ever to accept Bitcoin as a currency, and creator of Dragon's Tale, which is likely the longest running Bitcoin based business in the world (in continuous operation since October 2010.)Availability:The PS Coin initial alpha launch will commence worldwide this morning at 9am EST and allow traders to participate in the following initial crypto currency markets:* Bitcoin / Nxt* Bitcoin / Darkcoin* Bitcoin / Litecoin* Bitcoin / Paycoin* Bitcoin / Peercoin* Nxt / Darkcoin* Nxt / LitecoinOur initial alpha testers can only sign up after receiving an invite. Press and media personnel are encouraged to request an invite from us directly via e-mailing our co-founder, Daniel Pusateri: daniel@pscoin.com - Upon request, a very small amount of funds may be provided to press and media personnel for the purpose of testing the PS Coin exchange.Revelvant links:Website: https://pscoin.com/Interview: https://youtu.be/dLqhMIksOjUPress materials: https://d1s3cnxrjam8j.cloudfront.net/dl/PSCoin_Press_Materials.zip I believe we're actually the longest running Bitcoin based game in the world - continuous operation since October of 2010. We'd routinely tell each other "you know, we're probably with future $100 bills right now. "(Bitcoins were about a nickel at the time. )Teppy Our daily peak-concurrent-players has been about 50 over the last 2 months. I don't have a 24-hour average, but I would guess between 35 and 40.Teppy Well, that was one tricky bug to find. We were linking against the wrong version of SSL - one which had a bug in it that was triggered by only one site that the server would communicate with to do geolocation. This caused SSL to clobber memory, crashing the server.Anyway, Dragon's Tale is back - see everyone in game!Teppy Just an update: The server is offline for at least tonight due to a crash bug. We've (likely) narrowed this down to memory corruption in the SSL library, though we haven't figured out the cause. So, some progress on the bug, but no way to estimate a time-to-find-it.Teppy 
We've changed to different hardware, different data center, further tightened firewalls, changed passwords, keys, and generated new wallet addresses. Trying to bring the server back up on the new hardware, but it keeps crashing - debugging this now.Teppy Dragon's Tale's hot wallet was hacked on 11/20/2014, and 50 BTC taken. I discovered this on 11/22 and have taken most of Dragon's Tale down until I find the vulnerability.Later on 11/22, the person returned the 50 BTC.I do not consider this person a thief - this was a total class act (he even paid the transaction fees.) If he or anyone else can help me figure out what happened, I'll have some nice rewards, and will smoke a 'Tardo. (And it goes without saying, he will continue to be welcome in Dragon's Tale.)This is the transaction withdrawing the 50 BTC: https://blockchain.info/tx/4624a5360439b39f8a062d519b12c8f6782e3c5f49932c29536adb213ed5a868And this is the one returning it: https://blockchain.info/tx/af1c8ec7d40307eb45918b303f77af9cbe239f6b40d5c0973495531cf02e0188 I'm getting an error from the server that I have not seen before, so we may have some extended downtime. It's in a section of code that I did not write - trying to contact the other initial developer for assistance.Teppy I have posted a reply on the main Dragon's Tale thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1392.220Teppy (Di) Since Anony2point0 has publicly accused us of not crediting a deposit, I think it's fair to publicly post his bet record and relevant data. (I previously showed him all of the data below, and he admitted that  yes, it seems he did gamble the 1 BTC away. He then repeatedly asked me for a 1 BTC loan, and then finally sent me a PM in game saying that he was posting to Bitcointalk.)In Dragon's Tale each player account has a single never-changing deposit address. The deposit address for Anony2point0 is: 12oMHLWYtE3SaMijwRkKUSJiQNtkiEC6pZ - he has deposited a total of 2.52429947 BTC at the time of this message. Our server and the blockchain agree on this. Also, the last send to that address is 1 BTC, on 9/17/2014. Let's look at Anony2point0's bet log starting just prior to this:Bet 10408 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 30 Won: kSAT 45: 17 days 8 hours 3 minutes 26 seconds ago.Bet 10409 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 60 Won: BTC 0Bet 10410 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 3 Won: BTC 0: 15 days 10 hours 50 minutes 3 seconds ago.Bet 10411 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 2 Won: BTC 0Bet 10412 for Anony2point0: dragonseggnog Bet: BTM 900 Won: BTM 400: 11 days 3 hours 18 minutes 55 seconds ago.Bet 10413 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 1 Won: BTC 0Bet 10414 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 10 Won: BTM 15Bet 10415 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 1 Won: BTC 0Bet 10416 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 10 Won: BTC 0Bet 10417 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 20 Won: BTC 0Bet 10418 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 60 Won: BTC 0Bet 10419 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 10 Won: BTC 0Bet 10421 for Anony2point0: dragonseggnog Bet: BTM 90 Won: BTM 260: 11 days 3 hours 16 minutes 55 seconds ago.Bet 10423 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 100 Won: BTM 150Bet 10424 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 1 Won: kSAT 1.50: 11 days 3 hours 14 minutes 48 seconds ago.Bet 10425 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 10 Won: BTM 15Bet 10426 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 1 Won: BTC 0Bet 10427 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 100 Won: BTC 0Bet 10428 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 300 Won: BTC 0Bet 10429 for Anony2point0: imperialpilsner Bet: BTM 200 Won: BTC 1.400Bet 10431 for Anony2point0: dragonseggnog Bet: BTM 900 Won: BTM 200: 11 days 3 hours 6 minutes 6 seconds ago.Bet 10432 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 300 Won: BTM 450Bet 10434 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: BTM 100 Won: BTM 150: 11 days 3 hours 3 minutes 56 seconds ago.Bet 10435 for Anony2point0: dragonseggnog Bet: BTM 900 Won: BTM 200Bet 10437 for Anony2point0: dragonseggnog Bet: BTM 90 Won: BTM 100: 11 days 3 hours 9 seconds ago.Bet 10439 for Anony2point0: dragonseggnog Bet: BTM 90 Won: BTM 170: 11 days 2 hours 56 minutes 24 seconds ago.Bet 10441 for Anony2point0: dragonseggnog Bet: kSAT 90 Won: BTM 1.80: 11 days 2 hours 53 minutes 10 seconds ago.Bet 10443 for Anony2point0: dragonseggnog Bet: kSAT 90 Won: kSAT 40Bet 10444 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 60 Won: BTC 0Bet 10445 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 30 Won: BTC 0Bet 10446 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 6 Won: kSAT 9Bet 10447 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 10 Won: kSAT 15Bet 10448 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 10 Won: kSAT 15Bet 10449 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 20 Won: kSAT 30Bet 10450 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 30 Won: kSAT 45Bet 10451 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 30 Won: BTC 0Bet 10452 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 10 Won: kSAT 15Bet 10453 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 20 Won: kSAT 30Bet 10454 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 30 Won: BTC 0: 11 days 2 hours 51 minutes 10 seconds ago.Bet 10455 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 1 Won: kSAT 1.50Bet 10456 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 1 Won: kSAT 1.50Bet 10457 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 2 Won: BTC 0Bet 10459 for Anony2point0: bench Bet: kSAT 30 Won: BTC 0: 9 days 19 hours 37 minutes 25 seconds ago.(Note: Some bet#'s are non-contiguous because the logging system uses some internally.)The bets just before Bet #10412 are small. However, Bet #10412 (which is right around the time of the 1 BTC send on the blockchain) the bets become very large, starting with a 0.9 BTC bet on a Dragon's Eggnog (drink.) After losing a net total of around 1 BTC, the bets again become small, starting at Bet 10441.I showed all of this to Anony2point0 a few days ago, and he agreed in private chat that it did seem he must have gambled the 1 BTC away. He then repeatedly asked me for a loan, and finally sent me a PM saying he was posting here.Anyway, I hope that settles the discussion. I have since added logging of deposits and withdrawals along with "balance available" values in the same stream as bets, which would be able to show with perfect confidence the relationship between deposits and bets. In this case it was easy because of the 2 day gap prior to the first of the large bets, but if someone had been rapidly depositing, betting and withdrawing, it would have been less clear.Teppy Game is now running. I suspect that a network change made by our ISP to guard against Shellshock related worms is causing many connections to the Dragon's Tale server to hang at the "sending login request" stage. I have taken Dragon's Tale offline while debugging this, but expect at least a few hours of downtime. I'll update here as I learn more.Teppy We give away small amounts of (real, withdrawable) Bitcoin for free. Search the soldier statues to find free gifts. Typically these are between 1,000 and 3,000 Satoshi each, but they can go as high as 5 BTC in a single gift. (I'm aware of several 0.5 BTC gifts.) You do not ever have to make a deposit.Of course it is a gambling game, and I do hope that those who enjoy the game will deposit and play at higher stakes. I've added a significant new system to Dragon's Tale called Governor's Tournaments. For those new to Dragon's Tale, I'll first describe the game itself, explain how governed islands work, and then how these new tournaments work.Dragon's Tale is an MMORPG where most of the content is Bitcoin based gambling. The game takes place in a 3D persistent world. All the games in Dragon's Tale are novel: You can tip cows, go fishing, launch fireworks, drink and smoke. We currently have 67 different games. Dragon's Tale is the oldest Bitcoin based gambling site on the internet (October 2010.)The game is set in the modern day, on a series of islands off the China coast. Travel between islands is by boat. Some of these islands are accessible to everyone, while others are "governed." Each month an in-game election is run, and a new set of 4 governors is elected.Governors control access to their island, and can now create tournaments with prizes. A Governor's Tournament may (for example) challenge players to fish in a particular type of pond on one specific island, and award prizes in proportion to each player's winnings on that pond. Other types of tournaments that have been run include drinking contests, smoking events, monkey races and free-for-alls.Many of these Governor's Tournaments limit play to only micro-stakes, yet have significant prize pools, often around 0.1 BTC. This type of a tournament is often called a Freeroll, because only a negligible amount of BTC is needed to participate. Dragon's Tale gives small amounts of Bitcoin out for free, enough to fund play in some of these tournaments. Funding for these prize pools is provided by the house (for now,) and is distributed to each island in proportion to the bets made on that island. The more you gamble on your home island, the richer the pots for that island. If you're new to Dragon's Tale, be sure to talk to the various Governors and their deputies, to get a feel for each island.Glad to answer any questions about the game, or about this new system. (If you already play Dragon's Tale and participate in this thread, include your character name!) Just posting to let everyone know that I'm aware of the problem and working on it with the ISP.Teppy That 5% edge goes down quickly as you level. And about half of the edge, currently, goes to those in your mentor chain, not to the house.Factor in skill games and various in-game giveaways and contests, and the true house edge is around 2%.Teppy Without depositing? Yes, it's very hard to make significant amounts. (It's been done though.)If you deposit? It's a casino - you'll lose a little bit more often than you win. but plenty of people have had huge wins. Several 10+ BTC wins in the last week in fact.Teppy "In 464 Runs, 50 Hits for a 119.16% Return"This means that the monkey has been released from his cage 464 times (# of games played), and of those, 50 landed on that particular square, and if you had placed an equal bet on the square each of those 464 times, your return would be 119.16% of those bets. (You would have made money.)The returns include the community squares where you get a prize regardless of where you bet.This is a historical return - it doesn't mean the monkey will continue landing there as often in the future (the monkey moves randomly.)Teppy Dragon's Tale is going strong - there are 64 players online as I write this. Stakes are anywhere from "kSAT" (1000 Satoshis) per bet to 10+ BTC per bet, and we still give away free Bitcoins to get comfortable with the game.Dragon's Tale certainly has the greatest concentration of Bitcoin enthusiasts of any virtual world - it's a great place to hang out with fellow Bitcoiners.Teppy ("Di" in Dragon's Tale) It is a casino, but it's the first MMORPG casino, and it's entirely Bitcoin based. It's also among the first sites to take Bitcoin, and has been in continuous operation since October 2010. I previously developed A Tale in the Desert.Dragon's Tale: http://www.dragons.tl I'll run another one with more notice - if I did one tomorrow (Tuesday) from 3:00PM EST - 5:00 PM, who here (who have never been in Dragon's Tale before) would try it?Teppy Just to confirm that, yeah, it's some scammer. eGenesis is the developer of Dragon's Tale and is owned primarily by me, Andrew Tepper.eGenesis/Dragon's Tale is not for sale; if you check the creation date on this account, you'll see that I've been involved with Bitcoins since they were half a cent each; we certainly don't need to sell stock to raise 2000 BTC Teppy1-412-973-7914 To celebrate our highest #online player-count since the last wave of Bitcoin excitement, I'm running a "semi-freeroll" tournament in Dragon's Tale. I figured this is also a good way to explain our tournaments for those new to the game.A true freeroll in Dragon's Tale is a tournament with meaningful sized prizes which limits players' bet sizes to a very small amount, typically an amount small enough that the free Bitcoin gifts in-game can cover your play. Imagine a slots tournament in a real casino where everyone is limited to 100 plays of 1 cent each, and the one that earns the most wins $1000 each - that's a freeroll.This tournament has no spend limits, so to reach the top tier would be very difficult without depositing. To win one of the top tier 100 BTM (0.1 BTC) prizes, be among the top 6 players by cumulative winnings during the 2 hour tournament period.The second tier awards 15 prizes of 20 BTM each. These will tend to be won by those that play for lower stakes, but not satoshi-level stakes.The third tier awards 50 prizes of 5 BTM each. Since there are only about 50 players logged in as I write this, everyone that plays (even non-depositors) should win a prize.This is also a great opportunity to meet all the friendly folks that hang out in Dragon's Tale - most are eager to show new users the ropes, just ask around. And, glad to answer any questions here.The tournament starts at 3:00PM EST and lasts for 2 hours.

These prizes will tend to go to those playing higher stakes.   The second tier is 300 BTM split evenly among 15 players also by winnings. The top-6 will also each claim one of these 20 BTM prizes. These prizes will tend to be won by those that play for lower stakes, though it may be hard to reach this level just from soldier gifts.   Finally, the third tier is 250 BTM split among 50 players - everyone that makes an effort should be able to claim one of these 5 BTM prizes, even if you don't deposit.   Here's the twist: There are no spend limits in this tournament. However, there are enough prizes that everyone playing at their own level should be able to win something.    It's great to be back in Costa Rica!

Bets start at 10 kSAT, and go up to 10 BTC. Maximum jackpot is 880 BTC.Dragon's Tale is the longest running Bitcoin-based gambling site in the world. We've been in continuous operation since October 2010 and now feature 64 different kinds of games. Actually, we have had a huge influx of "players" who log in, hit up statues, withdraw and leave, just over the last few days.It doesn't seem to be automated, though it may be bouncing off a bot net of some sort. Typically one such zombie player at a time, different path between statues (the game starts you in a slightly random position within each starting island, and randomizes the starting island.)IP addresses are all different, different hardware, different installs, not using proxies (or at least not publicly known ones; we use a proxy detection service.)The whole thing nets them about 25 cents per hour at current Bitcoin prices. Who does this???
For simple games in Dragon's Tale, it would be possible to implement provably fair bets, and I may do this at some point for those.Most of the games are much more complex or intentionally make use of hidden information as part of gameplay: For example in cow-tipping, each player has their own paytable representing which cow-tipping techniques are known, and how well each is known. These knowledge units are called "facets," and once you have 5 facets of a technique, you are able to perform that technique and teach facets to others. Each paytable is computed on the fly and balanced to 95% EV (plus Dragon's Treasures, a whole different discussion), but is not transmitted to the player: You have no way of knowing which techniques your character is capable of, though you get closer to this knowledge over time. Cow-tipping is a cross between gambling and a collection game!In other games the logic itself is hidden (server-side only) - part of the game is (collaboratively or individually) figuring this out. For instance, each of the berry types has it's own hidden rules which influence the harvest (jackpot.) Some berry types are considered "solved" while others are not, yet nobody knows for sure.Making all of Dragon's Tale provably fair would be the equivalent of making any other MMO provably fair. Dragon's Tale was initially hosted in the US - we concluded the same thing, for the same reasons. I also had 3 lawyers read the various laws (the ones you reference, and in our case the applicable Pennsylvania laws,) and each of them also felt that as long as we were Bitcoin only, it was fine.We then decided to take credit cards, and that would have clearly crossed the line, so before doing that we moved everything to Costa Rica.Glad to chat offline if you'd like - Bitcoins and gambling are a great fit.Teppy I'm writing to describe the latest "game" in Dragon's Tale, but also to share an interesting unintended consequence of a decision that I made months ago. (these effects are so interesting - this is why I love designing MMOs.)Since early on, large jackpots in Dragon's Tale have been announced game-wide and accompanied by fireworks displays. Announcements like "A Major Jackpot of 1.450 BTC by Emperatorzs on Fence: Watch Beetle Downs for a display of Mmmmmm Donuuuts in 15 seconds" would be heard several times an hour.The first unexpected effect was after I added drinks to the game: These were a way to buy yourself a fancy visual treat that pays off - sometimes less than the cost of the drink, sometimes more. Drinks could also be bought for friends in the game, and it became a popular custom to buy a round of drinks to celebrate a particularly large win.Over time, some of our top players began to notice that these "rounds of drinks" were sort of expected, and it was always by players that themselves seldom had large jackpots (because they only played for low stakes, didn't deposit, etc.) And so they asked if I could give a way for them to turn off these jackpot messages so that they wouldn't be constantly pestered for free drinks. These were our top players, so of course I accommodated the request.So fewer and fewer jackpot messages were displayed. The amount of play was still great, but players commented that the game seemed very quiet, and I noticed a fall in active players. It was logical to conclude that this was causal. My dilemma though was that I could not simply remove an option that many players liked.I explained all of the above in-game, and brainstormed with players about solutions - at the suggestion of Zebedee, we created a sort of lottery: Daily drawings for 50 BTM (0.05 BTC), weekly drawings for 500 BTM (0.5 BTC) and a monthly drawing for one Bitcoin. For each "Major Jackpot Message" that you generate, you get one ticket to each of the three drawings.Immediately nearly all players turned their Major Jackpot messages back on; numbers improved across the board, and the game once again felt alive. Yesterday's peak was 44 players. 2.5 BTC for a Dragon's Tale banner. Financisto: Tournament Organization, available to Level 10+ players, allow you to *almost* run lotteries. I'm working on a more proper lottery mechanism though, which will also be available to high level players (to organize; anyone can play.) They will allow nearly as much creative customization as Tournaments do now.Teppy In Dragon's Tale we've had at least two bets of 200 BTC each, and each one came up a winner (950 BTC paid out each.) Also at least one 100 BTC bet on a coconut tree (which I think was a loss), and a bunch of 60 BTC bets on benches.Teppy We did do the Malaki event, but you need to understand the context: A Tale in the Desert II was a non-combat game about building a perfect society in the face of social challenges constructed by the developers. There were challenges that required game-wide cooperation (building the Seven Great Works), while a mysterious stranger ("Gharib," played by me) did things to cause turmoil among players. Malaki was (as many players suspected) one of Gharib's agents, though the event was constructed to make this uncertain.Players had a number of tools to deal with Malaki, including the lawmaking process and the power of the Demi-Pharaoh. Either of these could have banned Malaki from the game, but players were reluctant to do so because there was a chance that the rare goods he offered would somehow advance (shortcut) the technology tree. It was a genuine case of moral ambiguity. More details about the event itself are here:    http://web.archive.org/web/20081203221126/http://wiki.atitd.net/tale2/TheTraderMalakiThough neither formal tool was used, community leaders created enough social pressure on would-be defectors to run Malaki out of town, thereby "winning" the scenario.ATITD explored all sorts of socially difficult puzzles, including the acquisition of power ("The Test of the Demi-Pharaoh,") online trust ("The Test of Marriage,") Monopolies ("The Test of the Funerary Temple"), the tragedy of the commons (mushroom ecology) and addiction (Speed of the Serpent.)A Tale in the Desert, now in it's 6th telling, still runs, though most of my attention these days is on Dragon's Tale. No dramatic content changes - I like to develop continuously and then when I think the game feels like Beta quality, announce Beta. I am going to do a bunch of freerolls, some higher stakes tournaments, load the soldiers with free coins, etc. A big party basically.We've never done a cigar smoking contest - that would be pretty twisted because the prize pool means an incentive to smoke, even when that's usually just a pure giveaway to those at the same bar.Teppy After nearly 3 years in development (October 2010), 17,000 players, 400k BTC won, the first Bitcoin gambling game is going to Beta!It all starts Friday, July 12 at Noon EST. We'll have freerolls all weekend. The news has already hit The Guardian, Gamasutra, Joystiq and other sites:---------------------eGenesis announces Beta for Dragon's Tale, the Gambling MMORPGJuly 8, 2013, Pittsburgh, PAeGenesis, developers of A Tale in the Desert annoucnce their next game, "Dragon's Tale." As the first MMORPG based on real-money gambling, Dragon's Tale brings a creative and intensely social experience to online gambling. Lead designer Andrew Tepper ("Teppy") explains:"The first thing that struck me about online gambling today is that it's a pretty lonely experience, typically one player in a web browser, watching a 2D slot machine. I've taken what I've learned in the last 15 years building MMORPGs and for the first time applied that to gambling. I've created an intensely social world where players can explore the game world together, share techniques, and rely on each other as they level up by completing gambling quests.""Furthermore, every game in Dragon's Tale is novel, and is designed for a 3D environment: You can tip cows, hunt for Dragon's Eggs, catch fish, run monkeys through mazes, feed ducks. There are 60 different games so far, with new ones being added all the time, and every one of them is a new take on gambling. About half the games are luck-based and half are skill-based."In addition to quest-based levels, Dragon's Tale features a complex tournament system, a student/mentor system, and a form of player-controlled governance that will be familiar to those that have played A Tale in the Desert.Dragon's Tale offers a free trial, and for those that wish to gamble, supports Bitcoins and credit cards. Beta testing begins Friday, July 12, 2013 at Noon EDT.Native clients are available for Windows, Linux and OSX: http://www.dragons.tl Darkmule is correct. And if you don't do the full 6x playthrough, the withdrawal fee is based on the deposit amount, not the withdraw amount. So for example:Buy 2 BTC on a Visa card for $200 [Balance is now 2 BTC]Bet 1 BTC on a Trash Can, win 10 BTC [Balance is now 11 BTC]Bet 1 BTC on a Trash Can and lose [Balance is now 10 BTC]Bet 2 BTC on a Trash Can and win 6 BTC [Balance is now 14 BTC]Sell 14 BTC back to the house for $1400  [At this point you've only made 4 BTC of bets, or a 2x playthrough, so the fee would be 2.00 BTC * 12% * ((6-2)/6) = 0.16 BTC = $16]So you'd actually only get back $1384 rather than $1400 because of only doing a 2x playthrough. Dragon's Tale is once again running from Costa Rica. This means that non-US players can now buy Bitcoins in-game at any of the ATM machines using a credit card. As always, US players can play with Bitcoins. Each of the Governed islands has an ATM, as does Xinren Tang. The minimum cash-in is 1 Euro worth, or about 12 BTM as of this post.We sell and buy back at exactly the midpoint between the current MtGox highest bid and lowest ask prices. There are some rules:* If you buy Bitcoins on a credit card, then you can't withdraw them as Bitcoins; you can only cash out to the same card you last bought them on.* If you're from the US you can't use this feature, because only brick & mortar casinos that pay what are essentially multimillion dollar bribes to politicians are allowed to do gambling. It will be sweet revenge when Bitcoins replace the dollar as the world's currency. * If you buy Bitcoins and then immediately sell them back without gambling, we'll charge you 12% of the amount you bought them for. The 12% is our cost, and factors in credit card fees both ways, MtGox commissions, typical market spread, and a 3% estimated fraud rate.* If you play through the purchased coins six times (raked games) we'll waive the 12% fee. We'll even pro-rate it, so if you only play-through three times, we'll charge 6% of the purchase amount when you cash-out.* With Visa cards you can cash in and out on the card. For Mastercards, we'll send winnings by wire transfer and charge you whatever our cost is for that, around 250 BTM ($25) as of this post.* We can waive any of these fees/restrictions on a case by case basis. When Dragon's Tale started, Bitcoins were five cents each, and even in those early days we'd say "you know, one day we're going to look back and realize that we were gambling with $100 bills."So a little mini-event: the moment we hit $100, I'm going to pick someone at random among those logged in and hand them a Bitcoin. (I'll filter out mules and those playing over a proxy, just to make it fair.)I'll also do a freerolls tournament with 1 BTC in prizes which will start at the same time.Teppy ("Di") Correct 1500mbps attack last night. The game should be back online within the hour, assuming the attack has stopped.I'm testing code this morning to allow our client+server to work over DDoS-protected (proxied) connections. I don't yet have the contract from the DDoS mitigation company, so I'd guess were still at least a couple days away from being protected. Same thing, 1100mbps this time; I had the ISP null-route the game server for the evening. I'll contact DDoS mitigation companies this morning. Withdrawals are back up, game is back 100% with the exception of the ability to buy Bitcoins on a credit card at ATMs. (Can't do that until the servers are back in Costa Rica due to silly US laws.) Yeah. The difficulty is that bandwidth out of Costa Rica is quite precious, and these files are huge. Doing offsite backups with any regularity would drastically increase our already high hosting costs. I'm looking into more exotic solutions like differential backups, and partial backups (players' level progress and a few other key pieces of data.) We already write backup files to different media (odd numbered backups go on one drive, even on another.) So aside from a "Katrina Level Event" (or malicious ISP!) we should be fine. We will need to buy some sort of DDoS protection service. I've got access now, servers should be back up in 30 minutes or less. Yeah, I'll of course reimburse for Feather Tree, herb licenses, etc. Also planning to do a nice freerolls tournament after we're back online for a day or so. I'll announce that here as well as in-game.When the game first comes back online it will be in a no-withdrawals mode because I want to have my IT guy reconfigure the compute server<=>Wallet firewall to lock out the Costa Rica IPs. (I was getting suspicious of the ISP itself, and transferred most funds from the hot wallet machine which trusts the game server to the warm wallet. Sending from the warm wallet requires physical access to that machine, Ok, finally got an email from their CEO who promised access to the server by Monday morning. I told him that a 72 hour downtime was unacceptable - waiting to hear back.Our other game, A Tale in the Desert, has had less than 72 hours of unscheduled downtime, cumulative, on over 8 years. We split funds into a hot wallet which is on a machine that we have physical access to, a warm wallet that is on a machine not directly connected to the internet, and a cold wallet which is not connected at all. All three wallets are safe and in our control. No Bitcoins have ever been kept on the DDoSed machine.What I don't have access to yet is the checkpoint (savegame) files for Dragon's Tale which are generated every 3 minutes while the game server runs. These are on a machine at the same colocation facility as the compute servers. Once I do have access, we'll have Dragon's Tale back up within 30 minutes. (Plenty of backup hardware in the US is always ready to go; I just need the most recent checkpoint file to flip the switch.)Teppy1-412-973-7914(c)
We're experiencing another outage due to a DDoS, which the ISP has confirmed is directed at us. I'm trying to get things moved back to the US temporarily - will update when I know more. rNrswMXSAyotfKUzRuPtA9Jb5pzXCiZQcK The game is back up. The ISP is telling me that the outage (10+ hours) was due to them re-configuring a firewall to be more resistant to future DDoS attacks. The way traffic flows between our servers looked to them like a DDoS. We may have another 1-2 hour outage in the next few days if they need us to reconfigure routing among our servers to accommodate their infrastructure - I haven't heard back yet if that will be necessary. We're back to the US as of last night; credit cards can't be used until we move back to Costa Rica. Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals are fine as always though. The game appears to be free of disconnects and lag. Working on this now. We're doing a halving-day celebration today, a freerolls tournament with 5 BTC in prizes. You'll need to get to Xinren island to join, which means reaching level 2. If you've never played Dragon's Tale, takes 30 minutes or so, and can easily be done without depositing. Just ask around in-game and someone will be glad to help level you up!Typically around 20 players will participate in a tournament like this, so that's about 0.25 BTC in prizes per person, for free. I realize this is short notice, but in about an hour we're having a fishing tournament in-game with 10 BTC of prizes. It's actually a pair of tournaments, one for Level 0-4 players, and one for Level 5+. I only see about ten Level 0-4 players logged in right now, so there's a very good chance as a new player to win some Bitcoins. (The way the tournament is structured, a prize of 0.25 BTC would be likely.)The grand prize for the Level 0-4 players is 1 BTC, and for Level 5+ players it's 3 BTC. And that record has now been broken - today we had a 600 BTC jackpot on a Coconut Tree. To be fair, it was a 300 BTC bet. (The previous record of 520 BTC was on a 90 BTC bet.) Yes, escrow would be in-game. It would be a fairly simple mechanism: The Arbiter would configure terms for the bet, and people betting would deposit their BTC, and when the Arbiter flipped the switch saying who won, all funds would go to the person he said.More advanced versions could allow for multiple bets on each side of a proposition, fixed odds other than 1:1, parimutuel rather than matched bets, etc. WoT identity (keyid) is 2834A5B88D322C31, user Teppy, and the same id is at http://www.dragons.tl/wotid.txt There's no set procedure. Of course "until I know you" doesn't scale, so in the future I may use something like what bitcoingateway.com used for selling Bitcoins on credit cards. Cumbersome, but AKAIK, not a single fraudulent transaction. Until I know/trust you, Bitcoins bought on a credit card can't be withdrawn as Bitcoins or gifted to those that are allowed to withdraw as Bitcoins for the obvious reasons. Fiat-money players can cash them back out to the same credit card they bought them on.For "normal play" we eat all fees. So you buy at the exact MtGox spot price, which is computed as the midpoint of the current best bid&ask, and sell back at the instant spot price. If someone uses this to just "play the market" and not do any actual gambling, we charge our own estimated cost, around 12%, when they cash out. A 6x playthrough waives this fee, a 3x play-through waives half the fee, etc.Any of the above can be waived on a case-by-case basis, and "Pure Bitcoin" players are never charged any such fees. Do we need some sort of escrow service prior to multi-sig being widely adopted? I'd be willing to code such a thing in Dragon's Tale where each proposition would have a designated arbiter, where it would match each side of the bet on a first-come basis (or do it parimutuel style), where the arbiter could set a bet arbitration fee (or charge nothing.)We have good security - for instance our hot wallet contains a small amount of funds and is on a machine with nothing running except bitcoind and sshd. We use warm (firewalled and encrypted) and cold (offline, encrypted) wallets for larger amounts. And my real name (Andrew Tepper), address (Home: 108 Foxwood Drive, Wexford, PA 15090) and even cell phone (1-412-973-7914) are well known. Correct - aside from sports betting, all the various federal laws don't actually criminalize gambling itself. Instead, they put up all sorts of rules around transmission of funds for purposes of funding a gambling account, or rules about gambling debts. And then the interesting part - they go on to define "money." And Bitcoin clearly doesn't fall within their definition, though there is a catch-all "...any other form of financial transaction, as the Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may jointly prescribe by regulation..."So, to make Bitcoins illegal for gambling, the Fed would have to recognize them as a form of money. I don't see that happening in the ... well, ever. We just had the single biggest jackpot in Dragon's Tale history. The player who won ("Jase") didn't want to post here directly because he uses his real name on the forums, so I'm posting for him: Here's the scoop. We just moved the game to Costa Rica, and now accept credit cards, though the game will continue to be denominated in Bitcoins. IOW, Bitcoin is the preferred way to play because "pure Bitcoin accounts" have no restrictions on in-game gifting, PvP play, instant withdrawals. Also, credit card charges are only available for non-US players, though there's no such restrictions on pure Bitcoin accounts.When you buy Bitcoins on a credit card, it sets a flag on your account. Once set, you can no longer withdraw Bitcoins, or gift to accounts that can withdraw Bitcoins, and you can't play PvP games against others that can withdraw Bitcoins. IOW, it sort of segregates the game into restricted and unlimited accounts. You can, however, cash out to the same credit card that you bought the Bitcoins on. Trusted long-time players have no such restrictions.Buying and selling Bitcoins on a credit card involves no fees (to you), no market spread, just an exact spot price, computed as the average of the realtime MtGox bid&ask. Of course *we* pay fees of around 12% round trip including MtGox fees, market spread, credit card fees and the occasional chargeback. When you buy Bitcoins on a credit card, a little indicator appears lower-left showing how far to go until you get a free cashout (typically around 6x playthough, as they say on other gambling sites.) This 12% and the 6x will be adjusted to reflect our actual costs as time goes on. For instance, the more volume we do, the lower fees our credit card gateway charges.BTW, on Friday we had the single biggest jackpot in Dragon's Tale history, 520 BTC. (A different player once had a better day, around 800 BTC net win, but this was the biggest single jackpot.)Beta is a couple weeks off - cashing out on credit cards won't work until probably Tuesday or so, and I'm refining some of the level quests to reflect the current higher Bitcoin/$ price, and to include more newly released games. We now have 51 different games, all radically different than bricks & mortar casino games. Yeah, I don't have a way to know if the person posting here is the same one as the one who "should" have access to that account. Anonymous accounts + annonymous money = better keep your password safe Assuming minimal funds in the account, might be better to just create a new one from scratch. If you can verify something about the account, I can at least fix your level.Teppy You can withdraw at any time - click on your avatar then Utility/Withdraw Bitcoins.What's your character name?

Willing to pay 5 BTC/hour.Teppy1-412-367-1000 We'll have two tournaments tomorrow, one of the variable-length all-games freerolls like above, and a new format: a skill-based fishing tournament. 1000 BTM (1.0 BTC) of prizes for the all-games one, and 1250 BTM for fishing:    1000 BTM proportional based on winnings     250 BTM to the single highest jackpotThere's a tournament-wide spend limit of 500 BTM, so it's important to think about going for the highest jackpot prize by playing risky & big, vs. grabbing a share of the much larger proportional pot. Times are all EDT (GMT-0400):    Thursday, March 15, 12:00 Noon: Variable-time Freeroll    Thursday, March 15, 5:00 PM: Skill-fishing Semi-FreerollI'm calling it a semi-freeroll because having the 25+ BTM bankroll needed can be gotten from soldier statues, though not as trivially as the 5-10 BTM bankroll needed for the first one. So a good strategy if you're not into making any deposits is to play the first freeroll with soldier gifts, and then use the almost-certain winnings to enter the second tournament. Make sense?

It's probably the most significant addition to Dragon's Tale since the Mentorship system.How a Tournament works is an Organizer (usually an eGenesis employee, but not always) puts up a prize pool of at least 1 BTC, and divides that into prize hoppers of at least 100 Bitmill each (a Bitmill is 1/1000 BTC.) Here are some examples of prize hoppers:  * 500 Bitmill to the player with the highest winnings in Dynasty Fire  * 2 BTC to be split evenly among the 5 players with the highest jackpots in any fishing game  * 1 BTC by lottery to the player that finds the most Bitmill in plants. Each Bitmil that you find is one lottery ticket.If a tournament consisted of these three prize hoppers, then the Organizer would need to put up 3.5 BTC to fund it and put it on the calendar. Tournaments are posted automatically to the Dragon's Tale website.Organizers can set rules for the tournament, and this is where things get interesting. Organizers will usually set several of the following limits:  * Number of spins (wagers) that each player can make during the Tournament  * Total amount each player can wager during the tournament  * Amount of time the Tournament lasts. This can be a range like "Random length of time, 10-20 minutes."  * Must hold a ticket of type X to participate  * Must be at least Level X  * Must be a part of one of these Mentorship families: ..., ..., ...  * Spin and Wager limits per game, or game set.So with a complex prize structure and bet limits, tournaments essentially change luck games into skill games. To play smart, you need to monitor how others are doing, which prize hoppers have a high reward vs. the amount of competition, and balance long-shot vs. slow & steady play.Often I'll set up tournaments with no entry fee and very low bet limits (1 Bitmill, 100 spins) but with larger prizes (1 BTC). So the expected cost is, say, 5 BTM to do 100 x 1 BTM spins, but if 10 players are participating, 100 BTM average prize per player. I call these Tournaments "freerolls" because it's easy to get enough free Bitmill from soldier statues to participate; having a large bankroll gives no advantage.As always, Dragon's Tale has no "playthrough requirements" or other nonsense - any Bitcoins that you receive or win are real, and you can withdraw them immediately, gift them to friends, or continue to play.Dragon's Tale is a free download, with native clients for Windows, Linux, and OSX: http://www.dragons.tlI'll use this thread to announce freerolls and other tournaments. Although really simple to play (click on a cow and say how much you want to bet), this is a pretty deep game: Initially you'll be able to perform just a few of 30 possible cow-tipping techniques. As you witness others tipping cows, you'll learn "facets" of those techniques. When you know at least 5 facets of a technique, you'll be able to perform it yourself, and teach it to others.With higher bets, there's a greater chance of performing more exotic techniques including pile drivers, complex flips and backward falls.Dragon's Tale is a free download with native clients for Windows, OSX and Linux. We'll even give you some free Bitcoins to get started. (Real, free, with no "playthrough" requirements or other nonsense.) Is the inside front cover, or back cover still available? If so I'd like to buy one of them for Dragon's Tale.Also, not sure if it fits the content of your magazine, but I'd love the chance to show you the game (and even provide numbers) for an article. Ok, try to grab me next time you're online - I play "Di." When you say "start from scratch" - does it want you do do the bench quest again (find 8 benches), or is the counter on "Kick a bench 20 times" on the seals quest resetting? Dragon's Tale and Seals With Clubs have teamed up to give away a total of 30 BTC this coming Sunday and Monday. This event costs nothing to enter, and you'll get to explore both games. Here's how it works:In Dragon's Tale, find the Seal, just southeast of where you enter the game. Click on him to start the Seals With Clubs challenge. All of the challenge items are very low-stakes, and can be completed with the free Bitcoins available from Soldier Statues.Some of the things you'll be doing include digging for coins in a garden, growing Jastaberries, sharing drinks with a friend, and finally, withdrawing some of your winnings. When you've completed the challenge, you'll be asked for your Seals With Clubs username, and entered into your choice of freerolls which will take place on Seals With Clubs on Sunday, Jan 15, 3:00 PM EST and Monday, Jan 16, 9:00 PM EST. Each freeroll tournament will have 15 BTC in prizes. You'll need accounts on both games of course:Dragon's Tale, the Gambling MMORPGPlay Bitcoin Poker at Seals With Clubs We've just released a special game that will only be around for the holidays - come help decorate the Dragon's Tale Christmas Tree! Each time you click an Ornament, you'll have a chance to select how much you wish to gamble, from 10 Bitmills (0.01 BTC) up. The higher you bet, the greater chance of a rare ornament. Red ornaments are the most common, then Blue, then the Origami shown on the lower branches. There are 15 possible ornament types, and with each one, a jackpot (except for lumps of coal.) When the tree is fully decorated (no lumps of coal), the star at the top will light.The tree keeps track of the total value of Ornaments displayed. Every time a new high-water mark is set, the tree's life renews for one week, so it's possible to keep the tree alive past Christmas.It's also possible to plant a private tree by donating one Bitcoin to the Faucet, located behind the Palace. Private trees can be admired by everyone, but can only be decorated by you and designated friends. So far, three private trees have been planted.Also, eight special holiday drinks have been released: Enjoy a Sugarplum Float, warm up with a Gingerbread Latte, or sip a Candycane Daiquiri.  It's been a while since I posted - Dragon's Tale is now up to 43 unique games in it's 3D multiplayer world. (92 games counting variants.) Our latest game is analog checkers, also known as Kanivan Tak. Pieces move the same distance as in normal checkers, but they're not limited to 45 degree angles. Players agree on a wager amount, with the winner taking all. Like most 2-player games in Dragon's Tale, there is no house rake.We've also just released Treefalls, a seemingly straightforward game where you pick leaves from any of the trees around the world. Most trees pay 95%, but every week one species secretly pays 105%, while three species only pay 85%. By clever play, you may be able to identify the magical species and play it repeatedly. More details are provided in-game at the Department of Herbal Resources.Another recent skill game is Qing Vases, where you try to arrange vases on shelves so that identical vases form straight lines. In Qing Vases you are able to influence which vases change from play-to-play. In the variant "Ming Vases" you don't influence which vases change, but can control how many change per play. Finally, the Han Vases variant is an almost pure-luck game that plays fast, and tends to have long winning streaks. (There is some debate on whether Han Vases is pure luck, or can be played as a skill game.)If you've never explored Dragon's Tale, download the client and join us. There are usually some friendly mentors around to give a tour, and direct you to some free Bitcoins to get started. Kanivan Tak:Qing Vases: 2 BTC for each of 2 slots for Dragon's Tale. I paid 50 BTC based on $250 for ~800k impressions, or a CPM of 31 cents or so. Even given the size of the ad, that should be a fantastic price. Here are the full stats:Number of Clicks: 204Unique IPs: 177Conversions: 2Net Income: 0.391 BTCA conversion was defined as having made any sort of deposit. We did have ~66 new players in that time, who collectively played for 159 hours. 23 of these players have played for > 1 hour, and 6 of those have been online in the last 24 hours. I've noticed (but haven't formally checked this) that new players don't deposit right away - they tend to play for quite a while using free Bitcoins, even doing some withdrawals initially.So, this ad campaign definitely wasn't a success, but whether it was a total waste remains to be seen. I'd be glad to share future conversion info on this group of players. Also interested to see how other advertisers fare. I'll bid 50 BTC to advertise Dragon's Tale. Have you tried Dragon's Tale? It's a 3D gambling MMORPG where all the games are novel - no clones of existing casino games. There are 35 game types so far, plus variants.http://www.dragons.tl It does not use your computer to mine while you play. It's been a while since I talked about Dragon's Tale in the Bitcoin forums, and since the Bicoin community has grown so much lately, I thought now would be a good time to introduce it to new members.Dragon's Tale is the Disney World of gambling. It's a 3D MMORPG where every object that you can see is a game of some sort, from the buildings to the plants. In most MMORPGs your character advances by fighting - in Dragon's Tale you level up by gambling. You can grow crops, race beetles, feed ducks, or even put on a fireworks show for friends in the game. We have 35+ games, all novel: about half of these are games of chance, and half are games of skill. We'll even give you free Bitcoins to get started, no strings attached. (As in, none of the playthough nonsense that every other online casino uses - when you get a gift from any of the Soldier Statues throughout the game, it's yours to play or withdraw.) Of course I hope you'll love the game and bring some Bitcoins of your own to play.Dragon's Tale is by my company, eGenesis. We're the guys behind A Tale in the Desert. It is built entirely around Bitcoins, and has native clients for Windows, OSX, and Linux.Check out the website and Wiki for downloads and more details: http://www.dragons.tlLooking forward to seeing everyone in-game,Teppy ("Di") About half the games are pure luck, and half blend skill with luck, similar to the way poker blends skill and luck. The really huge jackpots like the one last night tend to be in the luck based games, of course, but there are some players that stick just to the skill games.I'll do a more thorough write-up on the Wiki about how the skill-based games work, but basically it's like this: The payouts of a particular type of game are fixed, but the cost-to-play varies. The server adjusts the cost-to-play such that the game returns 95% to players overall (plus up to 3% Dragon's Treasure.) So essentially the skill based games are indirectly PvP - the best players can consistently win those games that they are good at.Most of the skill based games cost 0.01+ BTC per play, though there's a very low-stakes "Rice Pond" just southeast of town center. Rice Pond is a perfect introduction to a simple skill-based game. There's a video explaining the game on YouTube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1iKY0VHKQQ
There are two main pieces of Federal legislation that deal with gambling: The "'Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006'' which deals with funding gambling accounts, accepting or extending credit for purposes of funding gambling accounts, transmission of money by wire for that purpose, etc. The full text of the law is here:  http://www.gambling-law-us.com/Federal-Laws/UIGEA-Text.htmThere's a catch-all that would allow the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to write a regulation declaring that Bitcoins are a money transmission mechanism, but they haven't done this yet.There is also the original "Federal Wire Wager Act", which only deals with bets on sporting events.Finally, there are Pennsylvania laws to be aware of, but those deal with places of gambling, and manufacture of gambling equipment. Interestingly, there's a special exemption for manufacturing playing cards in PA, but no exemption for dice.I suppose that you might make a case that "programming" is manufacturing, or that a 3D virtual world is a place, but that doesn't seem to be the intent of the law. If that were so, every MMORPG with trade-able items and an element of luck (IOW, all MMORPGs), would be violating the PA law to the same extent. Answers to a few questions:ptmhd: An email address is requested but not required. We'll only ever use this to tell you about Dragon's Tale news, and other games that we (eGenesis) make. So, you may get a message when we release A Tale in the Desert VI, for instance.Film2240: The soldiers do limit how often you can return to them, and they require you to visit many different soldiers before returning. Check the wiki for tips on coin-hunting from soldiers. For instance, you may elect to skip smaller gifts and collect fewer larger gifts: the soldiers pay attention to the *number* of gifts that they give you, not the size. You can also make a small deposit - a tenth of a Bitcoin bypasses probably hours of running around to soldiers.As to the idea about letting you reclaim large losses within X minutes, it's just too hard to make the math work: If the game worked this way, you could place a single large bet; if you win, withdraw the BTC. If you lose, reclaim the bet and try again. That would be clever, but no, just a 3D game engine. Were you doing Beetle Racing with us yesterday? I just finished a really nice, clean interface to that game. Hoping to get some races going this afternoon. Just an update on the free Bitcoins in soldier statues: I've made it so that a given soldier won't repeatedly give Bitcoins to the same character. There were already controls in place such that each character had to rotate through different soldiers, so this is sort of the reverse of that.So far it's has worked well - as I write this, every soldier now has a gift of at least one Bitmill (1/1000 BTC), and quite a few have gifts of 2 or 3 Bitmills. Gifts of 10, 50, 500, and 5000 (5 BTC) happen from time to time, as well.We're going to do some small-stakes Beetle Racing today, so come grab some gifts and try to multiply them if you're inclined! Come on over to Dragon's Tale - we have a faucet in-game - just look for the Soldier statues. Most just give a bitmill or two (1/1000 BTC), but you can visit many. It's a casino MMORPG, so I hope you'll play the games, but if you're just looking for your first few bitcents, I'd be glad to help. The game's URL is in my sig. Right now, 0.01 BTC is the minimum withdrawal. It's also, right now, the minimum gift that any of the Soldier Statues give, so players can withdraw any gift right away.The 0.01BTC gifts are getting sort of expensive - I think we gave away 25 BTC or so in the last week, and might be down net 12 BTC for the week. IOW, some people deposited BTC and played: Some won and took their winnings, some lost, some got free gifts and played with those, some took gifts and withdrew them.I'll soon start doing a mix of <0.01BTC gifts, along with existing denominations (0.01, 0.05, 0.50, 5.00), and allowing smaller withdrawals. There will be a checkbox for the player withdrawing to pay a 0.01 BTC TX fee, and it will be permanently enabled for withdrawals <0.01 BTC. (Most nodes won't confirm transactions <0.01 BTC without a 0.01 BTC fee, correct?)Teppy We're working on a new island which will reveal the story of Dragon's Tale as your character progresses. If you'd like a preview, contact me in-game (I play "Di"), and I'll warp you to the new island. We've been using Bitmill for a while now in Dragon's Tale. People seem to understand pretty naturally.We also use Bitmicron for 1/1000000 of a Bitcoin, and will soon switch to Satoshi for 1/100000000 of a Bitcoin.Teppy Make sure the install directory (the one containing elaunch) is writable. elaunch will download a file egenesis.lc from one of our servers, and then look inside that to figure out what stuff in that same directory to patch. (Executable and library files.) In the last week I've paid 3 different people for services using Bitcoins: One for advertising, and two for tech projects. Already I find Bitcoins quicker and more convenient than PayPal. Bitcoins trickle out at the rate, currently, of about 1-3 BTC/day to the statues in total. If you go behind the big pagoda, you'll see a faucet (a little homage to Gavin's original Bitcoin Faucet) and you can click on it to see how many coins are in statues total, and how many are in the system in total.Every day it will distribute about 1/14 of whatever is in the faucet, to the statues.It distributes 24x7, at random intervals, so there's no "best" time to hunt for coins. If a given statue has more than one denomination of gift, it will always offer the highest one. A good hunting strategy is to seek those statues in out-of-the-way locations, because they tend to be searched less often, and the larger gifts sit there longer.I'll be releasing a new Dragon's Tale game "The Great Wall," later today. Takes about a minute to learn, and you get to show off your best plays. I'll demo it at 2:00PM EDT. You don't have to spend any BTC, Dollars, Euros, or Yen to play Dragon's Tale. The software is free, no credit card is required, truly no catch. We do ask for an email address, but don't require one.We're the guys behind "A Tale in the Desert," which has been around for almost 8 years, won all sorts of awards, and is respected in the MMORPG world for our unique social and crafting gameplay.Dragon's Tale is a new kind of game - it's a cross between an MMORPG and a casino. Imagine a casino where some of the games are luck-based, and some are skill-based, and where you increase your character's level up by gambling.I'm giving away free Bitcoins because I think that some people will try the games at low-stakes, and then want to play for higher stakes. But it bugs me when companies say "free (whatever)" and then there's all sorts of fine print that makes it not-free.The gifts are small, but they're real, and if people like the gameplay itself, the game should be successful. I've implemented a feature in Dragon's Tale, the Bitcoin-based Casino MMORPG, that gives free Bitcoins, with no catch.As you explore, you'll come across Soldier statues like the ones shown above: Click on one and "Ask for a Gift." They'll often give a 0.01 Bitcoin gift, but sometimes a 0.05, 0.50, or even occasionally a 5.00 Bitcoin gift, no strings attached: Unlike other casinos, these are real gifts that you can immediately withdraw. Of course I hope that you'll use the gifts to experience all the unique games that we've built into Dragon's Tale, and I hope that you'll even bring a few Bitcoins of your own some day to play.Dragon's Tale runs (natively) in Windows, Linux, and OSX, and can be downloaded here. About to give away 300+ of unclaimed Bitcoins - if you got a party invite but haven't logged in yet, do it soon!Teppy Should now be fixed, sorry for that bug. Confirm here once you log in. Final prize pool and schedule, all times EST:500 BTC to be split at the start of the party among those who learned the game and got a party invite by either Kat, Ramapithecus, or Di, and who show up during the first 4 hours. (12:00 Noon)100 BTC prize for the biggest gain in Bitcoins during the party. (So biggest low->high swing). Awarded at 5:30 PM.100 BTC consolation prize for the biggest loss in Bitcoins during the party (Biggest high->low swing). Note that the same person could win both prizes. Awarded at 5:30PM50 BTC for the best bug find - Announced here sometime tomorrow50 BTC for the best game suggestion - Announced here sometime tomorrow200+ BTC prize pool split among the top 21 party challenge scores. We'll do this at around 4:30 PM. Any unclaimed BTC from the pool of 500 will be added to this pool. Hey, Steven - I see that you've figured out a bunch of games on your own - I've flagged you for the party - see you there!Teppy ptmhd: good idea - I've lowered the costs on many games (installed lower-stakes versions, or implemented mixed-stakes wagering):There's a new area southeast of the Palace with a Bitmill (1/1000 BTC) based Rice Pond fishing game, some 1 BTM and 100 BTM plants, coconut trees, etc. Also, 1 BTM and 100 BTM Bamboo Ponds.Silly Monkey and Beetle Downs now allow wagering in any denomination from 1 BTM to 1+ BTC.Berry seeds now come in Field (1 BTM), Island (10 BTM), Wild (100 BTM), and Garden (1 BTC) strains. Not all species of berries come in all strains, because berries are a skill (discovery) game.Finally, there are two new Fire games: "Element Fire" is east of the Palace with some really nice fireworks for 1 BTM per launch, and Gem Fire is on the hill west of town for 100 BTM per launch.Remember to check soldier statues for free Bitcoins - the ones right near the entrance tend to be dry, but there are a ton of statues around with 50 BTM gifts, and you can hit as many of these as you'd like. I even see several statues with 500 BTM gifts right now. I've just made a cool little addition to Dragon's Tale - the in-game equivalent of the Bitcoin Faucet.Any time you see a soldier statue, you can click on it and see if it's hiding a gift. Like the real Bitcoin Faucet, gifts are sometimes 0.05 Bitcoins, and sometimes 0.50 Bitcoins. And as a little tribute to the original Bitcoin Faucet, occasionally a soldier will have a 5.00 Bitcoin gift.Statues are hidden all over town - the more remote ones may tend to be visited more often, and so may tend to have larger or more frequent gifts.You can withdraw any gifts immediately if you'd like, though we're hoping that you use them to explore some of the games within Dragon's Tale. There are just a few low-stakes games at the moment, but filling those out is our next major push.There are some restrictions - you can't just click the same statue repeatedly for multiple gifts, but discovering the rules and figuring out a way to maximize gifts is considered part of the game. I'm online now, will be here for 30+ minutes.
***PARTY UPDATE***Id just like to update everyone on the state of the Dragons Tale Beta Party / 1000 BTC giveaway.Were still scheduled to have the party on Sunday, February 6th, from noon until 6:30p.m. Eastern (GMT-0500).  So far twenty-one players have gotten a tour and consequently an invitation from either me or another mentor.  So as of right now, if everyone shows up, each player will get approximately 24 (500/21) Bitcoins to play with. If some don't show up by, say, 4:00, I'll consider those coins unclaimed, and will distribute them in some surprise way. There's still plenty of time to take a tour.Now, some updates about the game and the party structure I outlined earlier (were still working on it so this is subject to some small changes, but expect nothing substantial, perhaps just small tweaks here & there  the structure will be finalized and published before the party).First, weve officially introduced games based on BTM & BTU as well as BTC.  A BTM ("BitMill") is one-thousandth of a Bitcoin, and a BTU ("BitMicron") is one-millionth of a bitcoin.  This will to allow players of varying bankrolls to play the different games as they like.  Look for the soldier statues holding spears of Bitcoins, Bitmills, and Bitmicrons to find the higher- and lower-stakes games.Regarding the 100 BTC biggest winner bonus (and the consolation prize): we will award those based on the largest winning (and losing) streaks. So if you have a big loss and a big comeback, or vise-versa, you could win both prizes.Were keeping the specifics of the 200 BTC in other giveaways secret until the party, but Ill give a few teasers here: at random times throughout the party well be giving away coins in the form of coin-showers well make system-wide announcements a short bit before the event and then everyone who gets to the area can try to catch the falling coins.Also, well have party challenges  tasks for you to attempt to complete during the party.  They range from very simple to very difficult.  Some require you to cooperate and play with others; others will be tasks you can accomplish on your own.  Completing the party challenges serves two purposes.  First, every party challenge that you complete earns you a raffle ticket into the game-lease giveaway.  Secondly, well be giving away bonuses based on completing as many  challenges as possible from a special Party Quest - leaderboards scattered around town let you track progress vs. other players.After the party, you will have the option to fill out a survey, in which you will be able to stake your claim to the two 50 BTC bounties the 50 BTC bounty for the best game suggestion will be awarded by a panel of eGenesis staff and Dragons Tale volunteers; if any previously unknown bugs are found, we will award 50 BTC to the most critical bug submitter  this will be determined by me (the programmer) alone.I hope this starts to address the questions Ive been receiving and, as always, please dont hesitate to ask me here or in-game about anything else.I look forward to seeing everyone on February 6.Good Luck!Teppy I'll be online today until at least 5:00PM EST. If, say, 3:00PM works for you, log in then. If others want to do a tour at 3:00PM today, just log in and we'll get a group together.Teppy A 64 bit Linux build is on our to-do list. It probably won't make it in by Feb 6 though. I know that (at least in Ubuntu) it's possible to install the 32 bit libraries to get it to work, but I don't recall which ones are needed. (I use Linux on my desktop, but I'm not a Linux expert.) I'll ask the guy that maintains the Linux distro what is involved. Right, it's on Feb 6, which is a Sunday. I'm still working out the prize pools, but I'm thinking something like this:500 BTC split among those that have logged in beforehand and been flagged by an existing mentor. We'll give this out as those on the list log in. So far, 5 people in that group.100 BTC bonus BTC to the person that wins the most Bitcoins.100 BTC consolation prize to whoever loses the most.50 BTC bounty for the best suggestion for the game50 BTC bounty for best bug-find. (If no unknown bugs are found, I'll roll this over to something else.)200 BTC worth of other giveaways. I'm creating a bunch of mini-quests, and maybe we'll do giveaways based on who completes the most mini-quests. Pegasus - pretty much any GPU will work, and bandwidth (once you have downloaded all resources) is around 5kbps. So (not counting the initial download), it will actually work over a modem.So far just 5 people have signed up, so 200 Bitcoins each on average. I'll be online all day for tours.http://www.dragons.tl Cynosure - I see you've logged in, and I think Ramapithecus flagged you for the Feb 6 giveaway, but you can check that by clicking on your avatar, and then Utility/Feb 6 Party Information.Pegasus - It's a closed source server/client. I've considered open-sourcing it, but to reap the advantages of open-source requires some resources (documentation, increased project management) that I can't spare ATM. It may eventually happen, or may happen with the next client/server architecture that I'm developing. We do maintain a PPC version of the client for OSX.I'll be in game most of today for anyone that wants a quick tour and flag for Feb 6. Over the first weekend of February 6, Dragons Tale, the Bitcoin-powered Gambling MMORPG, will host a party to commemorate our forthcoming Beta release with a Grand Opening Party by giving away one grand in Bitcoins!We will be giving away 1000 Bitcoins to readers of the bitcoin.org forum (and of course our current players) who sign up for the party and show up to help demo all our new features.For newcomers or those of you who may not have been by since our Alpha party in October, youll find:    * A modified world design with more games and more to discover.    * New PvP (Player-vs. Player) games with no house advantage: Smart players can expect >100% return.    * Multiplayer strategy games with no house advantage.    * Micro-stakes games with wagers of 1/1000 Bitcoin. Play for hours with a single Bitcoin.    * Many more skill games in which using a smarter strategy than other players have will give you a big edge.    * Dragons Treasures, bundles of 100 Bitcoins, awarded based on your play.    * A greatly expanded Level system: Completing Level Quests increases the rate that you earn Dragons Treasures.    * A new mentorship program in which experienced players get rewarded for helping out new players. Even if you dont gamble, you can still earn Dragons Treasures by introducing new players to the game and showing them around.And on the day of the party, in addition to free coins, expect:    * A world-wide treasure hunt for hidden prizes.    * Bonuses for the biggest winners, and even a 100 BTC consolation prize for the biggest loser!    * Scheduled raffles, giveaways, and other surprises throughout.    * A chance to own a piece of Dragons Tale. Depending on turnout, well be giving away ownership of a single game for a 3-month period. For that game, you are the house.Why are we doing this?Obviously wed love for you to try Dragons Tale, fall in love with it, and tell all your friends, but were throwing this party because we value the input of and feedback from the Bitcoin community.Were trying to create something never before seen with this game. With Dragons Tale were striving to create a platform that simultaneously embodies the social recreation that MMORPGs provide as well as the excitement known to the casual - and advantage gambler within the context of this new cryptocurrency that has caught all of our attention.Are we trying to be something for everybody? Absolutely not. Were trying to be something novel, exciting, and, most importantly, fun for a select group, and we while we believe that many of bitcoin.orgs readers will be among that group, we know that bitcoin.orgs readers wont bite their tongues when it comes to giving us useful feedback.As such, a significant portion of the giveaway will go to those who provide us their comments and critiques in the days after the event. Well be providing bounties for the best suggestions, best critiques, and more.Whats the catch?Simple  we want your input. This is a no-strings-attached giveaway. You will not be required to deposit any BTC whatsoever to participate, play, or win. But since were after your feedback, we need our partygoers to be familiar with the basic operations of the game  anyway, we hope to be way too busy entertaining to answer your questions during the party itself!So, in order to be invited to the giveaway party, all we ask is that you log in to Dragons Tale sometime prior to the day of the event, and learn enough from me (Di) or one of the games current Mentors (Ramapithecus, Kat) to explain them to others. Well then flag you as eligible for the main giveaway on the 6th. We will schedule game tours and Q&A sessions over the next month, but often were online anyway, and are happy show you around at odd hours. We cant offer tours 24/7 while we gear up for the party, but suffice it to say well make every attempt to accommodate anybody who expresses an interest. Were a small company but were fortunate enough to have volunteers from around the world, so we hope to be able to accommodate everyones schedule/time zone.To sum up:   1. This February 6th, well be giving away 1,000 BTC to our current players and to bitcoin.org members at our Beta Test Celebration.   2. No deposit is required. You  dont need to give any personal information  the surveys will be conducted in-game so you dont even need to provide an email address.   3. In order to get invited to the party, all we ask is that you first learn the basics of the game by logging in to the game ahead of time, and get familiar with some of the games.   4. Orientations will be scheduled as demanded, and we hope to create a schedule that will accommodate absolutely everyone.   5. Everyone who attends the party will get a party-favor (in BTC of course), and we know that the night will see some big winners.Were working around the clock to get ready for our party, so were still hammering out the fine points, but please dont hesitate to ask me any questions in the meantime.To download the client software, visit:    http://www.dragons.tlHope to see you there!Teppy I've adopted the following in Dragon's Tale - is there some more accepted convention? Should we come up with some standard?0.001 Bitcoin : "1 Bitmill" or "1 BTM"0.000001 Bitcoin : "1 Bitmicron" or "1 BTU"Mill seems ok, because mills are used to specify tax rates (1 mill == 1/1000th of the value of an asset.)I don't really care for the Bitmicron abbreviation because I always read it as a British Thermal Unit, and the Greek mu symbol is hard to type. Furthermore, microns are a unit of length.Thoughts? The original idea was one where all transactions are conducted over a website only accessible via Tor. This part has been viable for years - it's always the money part that makes it risky for both the seller and the buyer.The parts involving mail and double-sending drugs are ways to make the business scale, and make it work globally. They give plausible deniability to those receiving drugs.I see lots of comments in this thread that "it would never work" and "the feds will come after you", but nothing detailing a specific way that they would detect who was mailing the drugs or running the business. The closest anyone came was Babylon, who suggested that the police might stake out all mailboxes in the area the packages came from, but that 's easily diffused: Locating the business in New York City, with 100k(?) public mailboxes would do the trick, or using common packaging like business envelopes.(And to those that don't understand the concept of a thought experiment: No, I'm not actually planning to start a heroin store.) FWIW, I've known Chaord for a while now, and he's a stand-up guy.I've been directing people to BitCoinGateway.com when they need Bitcoins to play Dragon's Tale, and all have reported quick and hassle-free service. We shouldn't require admin rights, so although this may work, I'd like to understand what is different about WIndows 7...Are you changing elaunch.exe to administrator rights, or eclientc.exe? If the later, then the file egenesis.bug from the install directory will be helpful. Contact me at either of the above phone numbers and I'll try to help. (If you call today, use the 1-412-973-7914 number.) It's been a couple weeks since the last Dragon's Tale play session - in that time I've focused exclusively on skill-based games. I've done most of these games with no house edge: This means that smart players should be able to consistently make Bitcoin by playing - I think that's pretty cool. I'll introduce the first five such games in-world, in a play session:    Saturday, Nov 6 from 4:00PM EDT (GMT-0400) until 6:00 PMGames include the strategic fishing game Rice Pond, the spatial reasoning game Reflection, the mind-reading game Tug, Parimutuel Beetle Racing, and The Eight Treasures of Chinese Cuisine. Dragon's Tale is a 50M+ download, so it's a good idea to download the client ahead of time:    http://www.dragons.tlNative clients are available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.  I was just doing some work on that part today - I may have introduced a bug.You can contact me at 1-800-498-3004 or 1-412-973-7914 and I'll be able to tell what's going wrong.TeppyThis is now fixed, thanks.Teppy Yeah, this needs 12+ people to be fun, so I think I won't code this - looks like no interest at all. (I'm surprised - I've done this before inside ATITD and it's a blast.)What I will do though, is for the next Dragon's Tale play session - probably a few days from now - focus entirely on PvP games with 100% return. (IOW, a smart player can expect a >100% EV for each "bet.") I'm thinking of running the classic game Werewolf within Dragon's Tale as a Halloween event. Though we'd play for Bitcoins, the house wouldn't take anything. Here's how Werewolf works:Three people are secretly picked as Werewolves. A werewolf knows that he is a werewolf, others do not.Everyone else, about 10 people, are Villagers. One of the Villagers is a Seer.Play proceeds in day-night cycles. During the day:1. Werewolves can smell up to 1 other person to determine if they are also a werewolf.2. Villagers can vote on a person to lynch. It takes a majority to lynch someone. Once a person is lynched, it is known whether he was in fact a werewolf.3. The seer can scry one person to determine if they are a werewolf.During the night:1. Werewolves can attack. It takes 2 werewolves working together to attack.The game ends when there are less than 2 werewolves (Villagers Win), or when there are no more Villagers (Werewolves win.) The pool of Bitcoins is split evenly among the living winners.The game would be played within Dragon's Tale, starting at 2:00PM EDT (GMT-0400); each round would be about 10 minutes. I addressed this in my original post: The seller maintains a list of both customers and innocent people. When a customer places an order, identical packages go out to both him, and a randomly selected innocent. The innocent list is equal in size to the customer list, so that receiving regular shipments of heroin fails to even meet a "preponderance of the evidence" standard. jgarzik,Could you have listtransactions also include the comment field associated with a transaction? Here's the problem I'm running into:Dragon's Tale MMO does periodic (every 3 minutes) checkpoints. If someone has withdrawn BTC since the last checkpoint and the server crashes, then when it comes back up (restoring the most recent checkpoint), they could withdraw the same BTC again! I deal with the opposite case cleanly: When someone requests an address to use to deposit BTC, I label that address and use getreceivedbylabel when computing their balance: My server and bitcoind are always in agreement WRT how many BTC the person has deposited. But unless I can query bitcoind about how many BTC were sent out on behalf of a player, I just have to trust the value stored in the last checkpoint file - very dangerous!My solution is to record a comment consisting of the player's name, in each outbound transaction, and then when doing a restore, read in the last N transactions to correct for unrecorded outbound transactions in the game's database.FWIW, this is almost exactly the same technique we use to sync the game database and our credit card merchant's database in A Tale in the Desert. Actually, Sevenblade is Liar's Poker, re-skinned.But you're right - there are a limited number of pure games of chance, unless you introduce decision making or skill-based PvP.There will be games with both decision making and PvP, but there's a nasty little game design secret that tells me that these will account for a tiny fraction of the games played in Dragon's Tale. The reasons are related:Skill-based PvP games are fun for the people that tend to win, and frustrating for the people that tend to lose. This was overwhelmingly obvious in Tales 1 and 2: We had an entire Discipline (1/7th of the game) that revolved around 2-player abstract games. It was a hugely popular discipline at first, but those people that tended to lose most of the time would get frustrated and quit the game, leaving a smaller, smarter population of Conflict Disciples. Then the less-smart half of those that remained would get frustrated and leave, etc., until we ended up with about a half dozen total geniuses. (Two of them were in fact Math PhDs.)Decision-Making games have a related problem: In order to set rates of return, I need to be sure I know the optimal play strategy. If I just sort of "wing it", then it's a matter of time before someone discovers a strategy with a 100%+ return and writes a macro to bankrupt the casino.An alternative approach is to have dynamic payback rates (which is the method that I've decided to use.) A daemon will watch overall player returns and adjust either the cost to play, or the payoff table. With this method, it's possible for the smartest players to play with 100%+ return, but still have the house profit overall. Returns for typical players will then tend to be quite a bit lower than all the other games in Dragon's Tale, because smart players will play very heavily. (Or even write macros to play for them, quickly and perfectly.)So I think that both types of games will have very few players, and that fun & easy games of pure chance will dominate. But we'll see - I like doing experiments  I've consulted with 3 lawyers and read the relevant statutes myself. Federal law deals entirely with extending credit for purposes of wagering, and the transmission of that credit over wires, or of checks over wires for purposes of wagering, etc. Online gambling itself appears to break no federal law:  http://www.gambling-law-us.com/Federal-Laws/UIGEA%20Text.htmAn interesting part of the law is that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System can make new regulations as to what is considered a "designated payment system." Wouldn't it be wild if they made such a regulation about Bitcoin?!? All three lawyers agreed that they don't just do that sort of thing by surprise and then a minute later start arresting people.Pennsylvania law prevents some forms of gambling when done at establishments, or when the wager is based on the results of a political contest, or "pool selling" (though that also seems to be establishment based.) It also prohibits the manufacture of physical items used in gambling. Playing cards are specifically allowed to be manufactured, though it's interesting that dice are not specifically allowed. IOW, Pennsylvania law is pretty specific. That said...Dragon's Tale is certainly "closer" to violating Pennsylvania law, though other MMOs would be equally close, if they contain any chance elements. Pennsylvania law, unlike most states, does not apply a "predominantly elements of chance" clause (which is often used to outlaw poker games at the state level.)That said, if it's determined that Dragon's Tale does violate Pennsylvania law, it's an easy matter to relocate the servers to another state.
The last session was small, but much fun. It's especially cool being able to "meet" fellow Bitcoiners. We'll do the next one tomorrow:  Friday, Oct 15, 2:00 PM EDT (GMT-0400) until 3:30If you haven't tried Dragon's Tale, it's a Casino MMORPG that I'm building: Everything that you see, everything that you touch, you can bet on, either individually, or with friends. There are no traditional casino games in Dragon's Tale: No dice, no card games, no roulette wheels. However, you may come across a coconut tree and shake it: Between 2 and 20 coconuts fall; if an odd number fall, you'll double your bet.You may climb a mountain and discover a bench next to an ornate table. In the middle of the table is a lever. Pull the lever and 5 fireworks shells launch on the other side of town: If 3 of the shells match, you win some Bitcoins. If 4 or 5 match, then the jackpot can get quite large, nearly 300 BTC for some combinations.Or you may come across a humble garden. Grab a shovel and dig -  it turns out that the soil is rich with Bitcoins, and finding successive bundles will double, triple or more your winnings. Jackpots in the 100's of BTC are possible.Everything takes place in a 3D persistant world powered by the same technology that runs A Tale in the Desert. If fact, for now, the way to get into Dragon's Tale is to download the ATITD client software, and when you launch it, select "Dragon's Tale" rather than "A Tale in the Desert." The client can be found on our website:  http://www.atitd.comAlso, you will need some Bitcoins to join the session. Bring as many or as few as you'd like.I play the character "Di" - Looking forward to seeing everyone once again!Teppy I'm looking for someone that can create a website for Dragon's Tale, the new Bitcoin based MMORPG casino. I'm not looking for bleeding edge technology, but a good clean design with well written copy is essential.I'll want to see some examples of other web sites you've done. My budget for the first version is 1000 BTC.Teppyteppy@egenesis.com412-973-7914 I'll be in both #bitcoin and #dragonstale on Freenode IRC to help with any tech problems.Teppy Yeah, I've used ATITD art in a lot of places while my artist creates the real stuff. You'll see this change over time - for instance, the Zodiac Fire launcher is new as of yesterday, the Bitcoin models now all look like Bitcoins instead of that medallion with swords, and the artwork for the Palace Garden game (you may not have seen this yet) is much improved.Each species of plant has different rules, not each particular plant. The payoff math on plants was actually non-intuitive (to me!): My first though was to set the initial jackpot amount to some number, say, 5, and set the cost to play at 1, and then payoff 10% of the time, and when you don't win, add 1 BTC to the jackpot for that particular plant. When playtesting that I seemed to be doing *really* well. A simulation revealed that the rules above have an expected return (far) above 100%. Most of the content is coded where I can create variants with different payoffs to give a different feel. Try playing Palace Garden and then try Lucky Garden (west of town) and Hidden Garden (north of town in the VIP area; I need a better name for that area.) To get into the VIP area, complete the "Won at 5 different games" achievement. Yeah, the Bitcoins are live, so you can actually win or lose. Bets are small - most are 1 BTC minimum, and returns are around 95% in most cases, though there are some bad bets which are as low as 89% return, and some good ones that can be close to 100%.I did a play session that introduced A Tale in the Desert players to Dragon's Tale and to Bitcoins. About 10 people showed up and maybe 6-7 of them came with more than 1 Bitcoin. (I required a balance of at least 1 to get in to the session.)Overall the house earned 49 BTC in about 90 minutes, and people were playing pretty much constantly from my casual observation. So you can work the math out for average cost per player per hour. I noticed this one guy was up 15 BTC, withdrew them and left   Here's a couple screenshots - they're not "carefully" done - just ones that I grabbed from my client.http://www.egenesis.com/Frame0020.pnghttp://www.egenesis.com/Frame0021.pngIn these, the character Di is playing "Zodiac Fire" - pulling the lever on the table launches a set of 5 fireworks shells on the far side of town. The goal is to match 3 or more shells from a launch.In the distance you can see plants, a lion statue (right of the road), a side-path - all of these have unique games to interact with. Here's one more screenshot showing the palace - that's the most traditional game - the windows open and it becomes a giant slot machine:http://www.egenesis.com/Frame0021.pngThe games do all take, and pay, real Bitcoins, and deposits and withdrawals are instant. I need to add code to allow the first 50(?) BTC to credit with 0 confirmations and additional ones with 1 or 2 confirms, and to prohibit withdrawals until all deposited BTC are confirmed. But for now everything is instant.I didn't build in any free-play preview mode, and I'm undecided on whether it's worth doing so. It's a non-trivial amount of work to go from a single currency game to a multi-currency one, where "fake Bitcoins" would be a second currency. IOW, am I better off spending time on that, or on creating more games.There's a very robust banking system behind the scenes. For instance, the house will never take a combination of bets where it can't pay theoretical maximums on all outstanding bets. Some of you may know me as lead designer of A Tale in the Desert http://www.atitd.com. I think that game designers all have far more ideas than they can possibly implement, and over the years I've had my share. When I get an idea, I write it down in a file on my computer, and I periodically peruse the list.One idea has been on that list for almost 10 years, and it's one that kept grabbing me: What if there were a truly different kind of casino that existed as a persistent world? A world where everything that you see, everything that you can touch, was in fact some sort of game. No traditional slot machines, card games, dice, but an RPG where your character advances by success at games of chance.Bitcoins rekindled that idea, and since learning of them, I've been brainstorming such a world. In September I started coding Dragon's Tale, an MMORPG set in China, which uses Bitcoins exclusively. The game is built on eGenesis System I, the same client/server that powers A Tale in the Desert.Earlier this week I had a few Bitcoin veterans in for an early look, and based on their feedback, I think I'm ready to open it up for another preview. I'd like to invite all of you to join me for a play session of Dragon's Tale:    Saturday, October 9, 2:00PM EDT (GMT-0400), for about 90 minutesYou'll need the ATITD client, which can be downloaded from http://www.atitd.comNative clients are available for Windows, OSX, and Linux. You'll also need a few Bitcoins to participate.(If you're on a slower connection, you may want to download just the "launcher", which will pull files as needed.)I'd be glad to answer any questions about Dragon's Tale here, and look forward to meeting everyone! It's an improvement because payments can be made without running the game software, or made on behalf of other players (which is common in our game at least), or made for several secondary accounts quickly (also which is common in our game.)Though it doesn't apply to ATITD, it would also strengthen anonymity for those who need it: A website could be set up on a static datastore like Freenet, rather than requiring a live network like Tor. I've been wanting something like this since day 1.A Tale in the Desert V accepts Bitcoins now. Each month, the procedure is:1. Player clicks an in-game menu item "Pay for my subscription using Bitcoins." A unique address is created.2. The game says "Send 150BTC to this address: xxxxxxx" (There's a "Copy to Clipboard" button on the dialog.)3. The player sends the BTC4. The player clicks "I have sent the Bitcoins." (System then verifies and activates account.)The procedure only takes 15-30 seconds total - probably quicker than typing in a credit card number. However, with the ability to attach a message, the procedure becomes:1. Player sends 150BTC to the standard ATITD Bitcoin address with his character name in the message field.2. Player clicks "I have sent the Bitcoins." (System then verifies and activates account.)We already have a couple players using Bitcoins to pay for subscriptions. One has generated his BTC, and the other has purchased some on one of the markets. I've submitted it - we'll see if it gets accepted. Anyone that frequents Slashdot should go to the "Firehose" section and "+" the submission. Ok, most of the suggestions have been integrated above, but one final question, mostly for satoshi, though others should chime in as well:Should we actually try to get press right now, or wait until we do have a so-called "1.0" ?  It's going to be easier to get accepted when "1.0" is out, and trying for two Slashdot stories might be a lot to ask for. Unless anyone else knows a Slashdot editor, I'd be willing to submit this when 1.0 is released. (More people submitting their own versions will improve the chances of hitting the front page.)(Technology Section)Headline: Bitcoin releases Version 0.3Tag: EncryptionBody: How's this for a disruptive technology? Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based digital currency with no central bank, and no transaction fees. Using a proof-of-work concept, nodes burn CPU cycles searching for bundles of coins, broadcasting their findings to the network. Analysis of energy usage indicates that the market value of Bitcoins is already above the value of the energy needed to generate them, indicating healthy demand. The community is hopeful the currency will remain outside the reach of any government.Comments?[Edited the "energy backed" language.][Eliminated the 21M number, as db suggested. Mentioning subdividing would be too wordy.][Incorporated some of amall's suggestions, including eliminating the passive voice in the final sentence.][Integrated satoshi's suggestions, eliminating the word "anonymous", mention of Hashcash, and the "developers expect" taunt.][Changed the closing sentence to dwdollar's "...community is hopeful..." language. Satoshi, are you OK with that?] I agree as well - "version 1.0" is ready-made for Slashdot. This is interesting, and is a possible way to embed messages inside anonymous payments, at the cost of transaction fees.So if a payment contains a No-op string that says "Message encrypted for Public Key [xxx]: [yyyyy]" then that gets passed along to the destination? Or even "Cleartext message to recipient: [zzzzz]."Of course the content of these messages - the [xxx] or [yyyyy] have nothing to do with Bitcoin, but they could be used as part of a layer on top of Bitcoin.The reason I'm so interested in embedding messages is that they allow use of a "static" anonymity network like Freenet, rather than a "live" network like Tor or I2P. Live networks have exit nodes, a few of which can be compromised. If a government compromises 1% of all exit nodes, then they have a small chance of figuring out where a given site is hosted. So to use my Heroin Store example, they would send an N byte message to the store and watch all of their compromised exit nodes for N byte messages. They'd do this over a few hours, watching where N byte messages got sent to, eventually discovering the IP address of the store.In a network like Freenet, data just floats around - there is no one machine where a website (for example) lives. You publish data to the cloud, and as long as people access it periodically, it stays around. What flaw do you see in my description that would allow either the buyer or seller to be discovered, including statistical attacks?The government does have huge resources, but they have not, to anyone's knowledge, broken PGP.See if you can come up with a specific attack that the government could do that would allow either a buyer or the seller to be discovered. Should we try for some publicity? Slashdot is good if we can get it.I've had a number of submissions accepted, though always by one editor that no longer works there. Anyone else with a Slashdot connection? I'll describe the art judging system (not quite the same as a reputation system, but related) used in A Tale in the Desert. Despite intense pressure to game it, and a really smart userbase, it has stood up remarkably well, and I think it may be as game-proof as any system could be given the constraints. Maybe some concepts from this can be used in a reputation system.Background: Players create location-based "real" art within the virtual world. Progress in the game based on how good their art is. "Good" is judged by fellow players (competitors in many cases.)Ok, first the constraints: Anonymous judges, known artists, continuous judging period, costly (in terms of player time) to judge the art.The big idea: "A good judge is one who tends to judge the way other good judges do."Details: A judge's Influence is the produce of his Quality and Worldlyness. As a judge, your Worldlyness is a score 0-1 based on the number of other judges that have judged a piece of art that you have judged. If you have co-judged any piece of art with another judge, then you are considered Peers. As a judge, your quality is a measure of how closely your scores on specific pieces of art correlate with Worldly judges.We limit the peer list on a given piece of art to a fixed number, and then randomly rotate judges out. This prevents a few frequently judged pieces from dominating the Worldlyness computations.We give limited feedback to judges in the form of "You tend to score paintings higher than your peers." We don't provide feedback of the form "Your scores on paintings tend to be opposite your peers." Yes, I2P or Tor would work for such a website. Freenet is probably more secure because there are no entry/exit nodes to monitor, but Freesites can only serve static content, and anonymous Bitcoin payments don't have a way to include a message with them.If every package originated at the same mailbox, then yes, I could imagine the government being able to detect the drug dealer by intensive surveillance. If the drug dealer used a random local mailbox, then it would get quite difficult because the set of people that use one of (let's say) 20 mailboxes would be huge.And if the concept really is bulletproof, then I'd imagine 100's of such websites would quickly spring up, making LE's job even more impossible. As a Libertarian, the thing I love most about the Bitcoin project is the chance that it could be truly disruptive.I think that drug prohibition is one of the most socially harmful things that the US has ever done, and so I would like to do a thought experiment about how a heroin store might operate, accepting Bitcoins, and ending drug prohibition in the process. We'll assume that the drug store is very high profile, and that law enforcement makes discovering the operator a high priority. We'll also assume that heroin is cheap when bought in bulk; the street price reflects the risk that street dealers must take to sell their product.A drug dealer would set up a website that accepts Bitcoins for heroin. Orders would require a physical address for shipping. When an order comes in, the dealer would send heroin through the mail to two addresses: the address provided, and another random address. Because packages of heroin are now arriving at addresses across the country, receiving a package does not imply that you ordered it. Random addresses would be heavily reused to prevent law enforcement from making a statistical argument.Now law enforcement could set up such a website as well, in order to discover buyers. So, the drug dealer must take half of his profits (and remember, he's already shipping 2x the amount paid for), and use them to buy heroin at other random websites, on behalf of both his customers and the random addresses that he has used.If the post office knows that a package contains drugs, then they could send an undercover officer to deliver the mail to your door, or surreptitiously watch your mailbox to see who collects the mail, and then get a warrant to search your house to see if the package has been opened and not discarded. (IIRC, discarded materials are no longer considered in your possession.)So, it would be important for buyers to not open any package that they suspect may contain their heroin, until they wish to consume it: they would only be in danger of possession between when the package was opened and when the contents was consumed.Can anyone see a way to attack the store? A nice addition to the GUI would be an estimate of how many hashes/sec it's computing. Either present this as a raw number or a "you can expect to generate X packs of bitcoins per week."This might partially solve the frustration of new users not getting any Bitcoins right away.
