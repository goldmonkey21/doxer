Haha! They should be ready to start shipping... in 2 weeks! Could be another DDoS then. I think I read they were having a problem with that this month. Their website is currently down. I doubt anyone has. I think they're around $10,000. People have lives. Wow. I wonder if I can get enough people to chip in and buy Ohio. Of course, they're probably not selling, so we'd have to vote in people who would allow it first. Then we might even be able to skip the buying it part and get those people to do what we wanted in the first place. Too bad it never works that way. I like it. It's been added to the newly attached zip. Good grief. I can't live and breathe this stuff like the rest of you can. So here's the code for the most recent release. I've got a Mt. Gox enabled version mostly done now and will post it once I finish and get rid of some useless, confusing (and commented out) stuff. As far as the code goes, the Mt. Gox stuff won't significantly affect anything you're seeing in this version of the source. The code is pretty basic and horribly uncommented, but the concept is there. It would be nice if someone would like to look at the address recognition stuff and come up with something more consistent. I'm thinking of using pure regex and not messing with the validation through the RPC so it will work better with Mt.Gox. If the address is invalid, it will fail during send. The code is public domain / free as in do whatever you want with it and do or don't give me credit. I appreciate and will include any good fixes and submissions, or you can spin off your own version because you're still pissed at me. I would buy every bitcoin in existence and then loan them to the government at interest to use as currency...Just kidding!   Working out some bugs in using SSL. Very short on time lately. Well, for starters a lot of new coins are currently being generated on GPU hardware at a better power consumption rate than his measly 2000 khash/s machine, which wasn't all that far off the going rate for bitcoins to begin with. I saw a figure once that it costs something like 4.5 cents to create a US penny. Frenzy UniverseIf they get at least 2 more 'likes' by the time they reach Seattle tomorrow, they'll send out 20 pairs of free goggles to random likers.http://www.facebook.com/pages/frenzy-universe/371478183356http://www.frenzyuniverse.com They'll be cabon nanofiber notes in 200 years. Or bitcoins. Either way your plastic will be worthless. What were we talking about? Do you have any 200-year-old bank notes? If you do, would they still be honored? I can't even keep current bills in my wallet for long. If you want long term storage, convert to something you feel is likely to retain value (nothing is guaranteed). This is currency, not artifacts or knowledge. It's supposed to be used.In the case of some war involving EMP, many smaller electronics should survive. Even so, if you're worried about that, you should stock up on things like food, medical supplies, and beer. That's what what people will want when the lights go out. "Freeeeedoooooom!" --Braveheart Or even Mt.Gox.This is a great idea. No one is going to ignore a decent size donation. Another crazy thought. You could set up a dead man's switch to sell them all off at a decent rate for LR and exchange that for a check in the mail to your beneficiary. Sure, a lot could go wrong, but it's easier for them. Why predict what you already own? This has been on my mind too. I like your solution. You could even have the proxy send to multiple receive addresses in the same wallet to mix it up some more. The only real problem I see is a compromise / shakedown of the proxy server. The thing with aluminum is it's like the 3rd most abundant element in the earth's crust. It's the process of extracting it that was difficult with older technology. Gold actually has a rarity. That said, I'm not a huge believer in gold, either. But then I don't have any. Of course, I don't have much of anything, dollars included.   
Inspired. Too bad I can't write lower case letters to the mag stripe. Clientless as in you don't need Bitcoin running on your own computer (though I guess it's not really the client part we're using here). You'll be able to access your Mt.Gox wallet. As for trading, if I go that far, you'll be able to buy more bitcoins from the extension, or convert them back to Mt.Gox dollars. You'll also be able to see a simplified version of the current market data. It's still going. I haven't had as much time to work on it lately. I've tweaked a few things but nothing big enough to make a new release. I'm also working with Mt.Gox to build a clientless version that may also support trading. Any chance of getting a larger or SVG version of this? Well according to that demographics section, we're all brown-haired, pale-skinned, shirtless dudes wearing jeans.    The burning question here is what job are all three of these characters applying for? https://squareup.com/Take credit, send coins. All from a smartphone. Customers could carry a 2D barcode with their address on it so it can be scanned with a smartphone camera for easy input. I see. Yeah, 60 years is a stretch. I do like the idea of a paper copy, especially in a presentable certificate/book form. Getting them to and from paper shouldn't be difficult, but importing and exporting to Bitcoin is the trick unless you transfer the whole file. Why not put it on a couple SD chips or USB flash drives and put those in your safe deposit box? I figured they'd do that. And retract the free shipping they qualified for. And claim it as a loss. And claim the items as stolen. And file a claim with their merchant provider under some fraud protection clause. And try to get a manufacturer's warranty. And then somehow extract the full amount from the stolen card holder anyway. This is why I keep stocking up on Cheerios. Unfortunately, just like dollars, the kids eat them as fast as I can acquire them. Is this an ongoing offer? Can we still buy in? There are still some situations where it doesn't show an error. I'm fixing them as I find them. It should be finding addresses on the page as long as it's connecting to Bitcoin. They should show up as links. It's not finding them all though, so I'm still working on that. Port 8333 should be the P2P port. The RPC interface listens on 8332 locally (127.0.0.1). If you changed that in the extension options, try changing it back. What you are describing sounds like it is connecting to something, but either authentication fails or it's not getting a response it recognizes. This is very helpful  Thank you. I love learning new things. Ok, can you tell me what operating system, Bitcoin version, and Chrome version you are running? Any other information about your setup might help, too. Are you running on a non-standard port? Are Bitcoin and Chrome running on the same computer? Not sure what you mean. It is the most recent release. Though I guess if the dollar is at home on your table while you're out, you would still say you 'have' it. You just might be wrong and not know it. Question is which words do you use to draw the right picture in someone's head who is new to bitcoin? You're absolutely right. I think correctness is important here. And saying "computer" leaves open the idea that you still have to secure your computer just as you would the tray that holds the key to your cash box. No, if you go back a page in this topic, it's not working there. Kinda wacky. I have some ideas as to what's causing it, but I'm not sure exactly why yet.
What if you said "only you have the keys," giving ownership/control to the person, rather than the computer? The animation can show USB flash drives or something at this point to illustrate the computer aspect. Or is that not clear enough? Yeah, I'm getting the same thing. Weird. The signatures usually all work for me. I've got a few tweaks in my head that might help the success rate of recognizing addresses.I was planning on porting this over to a Firefox extension at some point. Most of the code should work just about as-is, but the structure is a lot different, from what I understand. I've never worked with Firefox/greasemonkey. Well that's interesting. I'm getting it, too. It must be inheriting a style sheet from the bitcoinwatch page. Should be fixable.Now, you shouldn't have to highlight that address. It should be a link that you can click to open the send box. It doesn't catch every address yet because of how the surrounding HTML works in certain cases, but it should get most of them and that particular one is working on my end. Are you not getting links at all? Is this a windows machine? I ran into this on one running XP and nothing I did with the file seemed to satisfy it. I did get it to work by specifying them on the command line:bitcoin -server -rpcuser=mylogin -rpcpassword=mypassThe file worked perfectly on a different XP machine, so I'm not sure what the issue is. Until now I just thought I was crazy   (Just so you know what I'm talking about)I like this. I would suggest a handful of these, with minor variations in each one, sort of like a split marketing approach. I started writing something similarly non-technical, but yours is better. I like the idea for a series of small, specialized topics. My gears are turning now. You  have to set the rpcuser and rpcpassword options in bitcoin.conf, which you may have to create (same directory as the wallet.dat). Then you have to start Bitcoin with the -server switch or in daemon mode. You also have to set the extension options accordingly by right-clicking the bitcoin icon in Chrome and choosing Options. Or brute force individual private keys. Thanks. When I get some time I'll work on interfacing directly with Mt.Gox and/or MyBitcoin. Ok, I guess the address validation part of the JSON-RPC was added in 0.3.14, so that's probably why it's not working for you. It's alive. I just haven't worked on it in a few days. Did you get my question about what version of Bitcoin you're running? Would it make any sense to build in a way to manually lock your own client to a chain or even schedule it at regular intervals? So we'll have to master interstellar travel because we don't have enough matter in our own solar system to build a dyson sphere. I'm guessing the attacker would go for something easier and less correctable than replacing the locked-in block chain with a custom one. I guess this would be the official answer:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=437.0 Just learned a new word. Thanks. Does it even have to be a government to do this? Bitcoins are insignificant. You should give yours to me. Thanks . I am using a regex, but mine isn't quite as specific. Care if I swipe it? Ok, I tried this out on a debian box. At first I was getting my balance, so I was connecting to Bitcoin properly, but my attempts at sending coins all resulted in the "Error validating address string." The linux box was running Bitcoin 0.3.13 so I upgraded to 0.3.14, which is apparently the version that added the address validation. Now it works fine. However, the first time I clicked one of the links it created a box came up about loading an external link handler in which I chose 'Do nothing' and checked the box to make it permanent for that link type. This was because I formatted the links href as bitcoin:?addr= which can be changed or eliminated since it's not really used. So I suppose my next question is what version of Bitcoin are you using? (You can ignore me, it's OK).Bitcoins are possibly illegal tender you can use to evade taxes and fund criminal activities.Bitcoins are another reason for the Feds to raid your home.Bitcoins are like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon, wrapped 'round a large gold brick.Bitcoins make you go, "hmmm."Bitcions: 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on your car insurance.Bitcoin is not your daddy's currency.
Excellent. I'll let you know if I come up with anything on the linux front today. Agreed. Chrome 7 is latest stable version. Thanks. I'll check it out in linux tomorrow. Generated a couple hundred. Sold an iTunes card. Got one or two from Trick or Treat.Donated a few. Gambled some away. Is upgrading Chrome a possibility for you? Ok, next version is up. It will attempt to convert Bitcoin addresses to links which bring up the send box when clicked. It has some limitations and can still get confused, but it should work in most cases. You can still do the double-click to hi-light and right-click to send method in places where it fails.I'm working on getting ahold of some online wallet services to see about integrating them for a no-client-needed option. Though, unless they can also provide address verification, you'd still need the client to convert addresses to links and whatnot. Love it!   I've been thinking about this. Since it's not part of a tag, it would require parsing all the text on a page. And since there's nothing really overt to identify a bitcoin address as such, that means checking every word on the page for length, and then sending it to Bitcoin for verification, which can get pretty ugly. Still, it might be worth trying just to see how it performs.I'm liking the data- attributes idea for images. I'll have to take a closer look at that. Thanks for the feedback. Glad it's working. I just added explicit access to https, but the address on the extensions page still won't work because Chrome recognizes the extensions gallery and won't run scripts on it, so I've taken my address off of there. So both OS and version could be a factor. I'll try and see if I'm using some new or experimental feature. What OS / Chrome version are you using? Good call. Hmm... Good post by The Madhatter.Here's a couple:1. Everyone here is paranoid.2. Everyone here has good reason to be paranoid.3. I have this inexplicable desire to obtain more bitcoins.4. Number 3 is made difficult by paranoia.5. Pumpkins rot rather quickly once carved. Bitcoin is a secure, anonymous, digital, cash-like currency using an Internet-based transfer system.The more suggestions, the better here. Don't be shy. Spit out anything you can think of. Well I'll consider it a step in the right direction. Are you still getting your balance when you click the icon? If not, are your options still set after the upgrade? I've updated the extension so it doesn't use notifications anymore. Instead, it creates its own little box in the upper right of your browser tab. Please let me know if this works for you or not, or if you encounter any odd behaviors. Ok. I'll switch it to open a new tab or window and see if we can get it to work that way. Might be a day or two. Things got busy. Hmm, ok. Try right-clicking the little pumpkin picture beside my post and see if you get anything when you click the Send Bitcoins option from there (I set it up as previously described). In the mean time, I'll looking back through the code to see if I can find what went wrong. If you're up for it, I might send you the code to load raw and see if you can get debut info when it fails for you.Edit: Also check what happens (if anything) when you select some text other than a bitcoin address and choose Send Bitcoins. Hmmm, should be:(Wrench) -> Options -> Under the Hood -> Content Settings -> NotificationsI think they're enabled by default though, so that might not be the problem. Thanks for your comments, everyone. I'll try to respond to most of them here...I guess I didn't read this thoroughly the first time. You might need to turn on notifications. I know this can be annoying, but it is a first test version.Yes, it is pretty dirty. It was the easiest thing I could think of that I can access with javascript the way Chrome processes the dialog menu click. I'll have to mess around and see if it's even possible to access something like the address= parameter you suggest.Yes, but it is limited by Chrome. It's for storing options specific to the extension. If you want to avoid entering a password, you can't exactly use the JSON-RPC. If you want it to use a service like mybitcoin.com, you will have to enter a password and a captcha every time you do something. Any time you enter input it could be stored or forwarded to a dozen other sites and you'd never know. I do intend to open up the source, though.I'm going to make some updates and see if I can fix the send dialog so it doesn't have to use notifications. Then I'll post the source, ugly as it is.
I just now got around to watching that. Brilliant video. Thanks for sharing  Does your balance show up when you click the Bitcoin browser button? Make sure you're right-clicking after hilighting.You may also need to reload the page the address is on if you had it opened before you installed. I'll update my above post to include this as well.https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hhbhfoohbnjkdcndbhjlicijccioklea I actually sort of gathered that from some of your last few posts in this thread. What I've done is still fairly useful even if it doesn't meet your requirements. A stand-alone client in the form of a browser extension is a tad more complicated. The best way I can think to do it would be to interface with something like mybitcoin.com, which I'll look into. I just don't have the resources to host that end of it. You don't owe me a bounty, at least until I deliver on that.Would you mind helping me test this extension? I just learned how to build them yesterday, so this one is a big step toward stuff like you're looking for. Ok, posting a handful of screenshots here. I'm going to run through a couple more tests and then put it up on google and post the link in here. I'd like to take some time and tidy up the code a bit, but if everyone's that desperate to look at it, I'll give you what I've got. Functionality is fairly basic at this point, but here's what it does:- Makes a Bitcoin Icon in the browser you can click to check your balance.- You will need to right-click that Icon and go to options to set it up.- Allows you to hilight the text of a bitcoin address and right-click to choose a "Send Bitcoins" option, which opens a notification and lets you enter an amount to send.- The same "Send Bitcoins" option shows up when you right-click an image. This works a little different. If someone sets up a payment button using a graphic that says something like "Buy Now for 100 BTC!", they can set it up to work with the extension by loading the graphic like this:Code:<img src="100BTC.png?100|17v4AR81oFJLAG8jHDKJKNKjSvY2QAmf1V" />Placing the amount before the | and the address after. The amount can be left blank, but you have to include the | before the address. The amount will then automatically get filled in as seen in screenshot 1.You have to have Bitcoin running and in -server mode (which means setting up the RPC user and password options in bitcoin.conf). And don't forget to set the extension options or the other functions won't work. I've only tested this on two XP machines running Chrome 7 and Bitcoin 0.3.14 and one of them I had to specify the rpc login credentials on the command line for some reason.That's about the gist of it. Pretty basic so far, but it should be expandable to include things like:- SSL- Generate and paste a new receive address- Periodically check balance and alert changes- mybitcoin.com interface- Use mtgox.com data to show balance in USDI'll post back later with the google URL to install it.https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hhbhfoohbnjkdcndbhjlicijccioklea No repository. Just a folder with a handful of files. I'm close to having something somewhat presentable. Then I'll release it and post a zip of the sources. Sure. Ok. The API doesn't currently seem to support much info on individual received payments. I could set up a timer to periodically check the balance and report differences, but your best readout will be in Bitcoin itself. Otherwise I guess you'd have to use a different address for each received payment. I may have to think about it a bit while I finish the rest of this stuff.As for automatic detection of payment options, I think I'm going to start with having to select the text of a Bitcoin address, then right clicking and choosing "Send Bitcoins...". It will check to see if what you selected appears to be a valid address and then give you a box to enter an amount to send. After the first version I'll go back over and see if I can perfect some of the functionality. I just want something to start using. Ok, so I have about 80% of this working in Chrome. It just needs fleshed out and polished up a bit and most of the code should translate nicely to Firefox. I'm just not entirely sure what you mean by:1. Automatic receive and confirmation.Some sort of alert when you receive a payment? I just read a dualogy by Daniel Suarez that might be of interest to some of you. Basically a highly sophisticated botnet takes over the world and turns it into sort of a living MMOG. Members of the darknet use a digital currency that quickly outpaces the dollar and interact with each other (and various aspects of the world at large) using augmented reality displays in their glasses. I found some of the concepts interesting, so I thought some of you might want to check it out. It gets pretty graphic, so consider yourself warned. The first book is titled Daemon, the second is Freedom (tm). Then my mission is complete.   Trick or Treat! 17v4AR81oFJLAG8jHDKJKNKjSvY2QAmf1V +1 davidonpda+1 noagendamarket Well dibs might be unenforceable but apparently they work. Yours was the first and only offer. Thanks for playing. This offer is closed. No idea on the legality. I've seen it done on here before though. In honor of the BTC reaching the $0.10 mark on mtgox, I'm offering a single $10 USD iTunes card for 100BTC to whoever hits me up for it first. I got it in a raffle and I don't use iTunes so it's just been lying around in my car. I've attached a (very blurry) picture for proof it exists. Send me a private message if you're interested and I'll send you a unique address to send payment. I'll scratch it off and send you the code once payment is received. Switch to sending payment to IP addresses. They don't have to be static for this purpose. If you happen to miss it, too bad. Any unrelated person who happens to be at the requesting IP address probably sees tons of other random connection attempts from the Internet at large anyway. Yeah, I went 2 weeks with nothing and just about gave up on generating anything. Then claimed 2 blocks in under 6 hours. It's all about averages.
