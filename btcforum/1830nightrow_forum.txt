So true and so good :p Oui pour linuxfr, je viens de voir qu'en effet c'est toi l'auteur ...Comme quoi, la communauté francaise est plutot reduite en ce moment Sache en tout cas que sans ca je n'en aurait jamais entendu parler, je pense qu'il faut multiplier ce genre d'articles de prise de connaissance. Well, i have some free time, why not.I can't garantee that i will do it all, but i sure can start to work on it.just tell me how to do it  J'ai une 8800 gt avec un client GPU, ca ne génère pas terrible (tout est relatif) .... je suis a 21Mh/sJ'ai reussi a generer 2/3 blocs faciles quand la difficultée etait dans les 1000, mais la ca devient presque impossible ...Sinon j'ai entendu parler de bitcoin sur linuxfr a l'epoque ou ils ont fait un article, donc ca fait quelques moi que je suis sur ce projet en regardant ce qui passe, j'ai lu pas mal de posts du forum. Et je viens juste de trouver celui la qui parle de francais Je reflechi dans un avenir proche a vendre mes quelques bitcoin, mais je suis curieux de savoir ce que vous prevoyez de pouvoir acheter avec en france. A part le fait que ca n'arrete pas monter (speculation donc), je ne vois pas trop   Yop la !Encore un autre francais, mais pas un parisien.Interessé par bitcoin par le coté technique et je vois ca enfin comme un syteme financier alternatif qui pourrait tenir la route.Pour le moment je genere des bitcoin, mais avec la difficulté actuelle ca va pas monter vite ...Ca a au moins le merite de chauffer l'appartement  Vala, bonjour aux autres FR donc  I can only agree on that.Actually, wallet.dat is like a vault with the door open big.Anyone that gain a physical access on your computer, or can execute something on it could theorically transfert all you wallet away.We need some sorts of securisation.You could suggest for example that when generating the private key, the last X digits are show to the user to store somewhere else, and are not stored in wallet.dat.This way, you need both the password AND the wallet.dat to do anything.Password is stored nowhere on computeur, and is just used to complete private key when signing payments. One small question about transaction fee after reading what you wrote:What is going to happen to a transaction send with a 0.1 fee for example if every miner require a 0.2 fee ? Is it going to timeout, or will it wait forever ? Hi,I want to make a request for this client:Could it be possible to add a balance row ?This would look like this (small example):[state]              [date]          [debit]  [credit]     [balance ]3 confirmations - 10/11/2010 -           - +100.00 -1907 confirmations - 09/11/2010 - -45.00 -             - 909 confirmations - 07/11/2010 -           - +5.00    - 45This is much easier to handle transaction history this way.[edit: thx for the name] What about giving current block chain in the binary release, or put a link to a zipped version on the download page ?It isn't automated download, but is nonetheless much faster. I think that first, you have to define what you mean about "getting BITCOINS successful".For me, what you need is (in this order): - Get bitcoin known for its qualities (anonymous, secure (i think scammer are not possible), no or verry little fees, and so) - Have a robust plateform to convert BTC to any currency you may want - Have proofs of the strenght of the network (user database size as well as cryptographies analysis on the algorithm robustness) - Make sellers propose BTC as a payment optionsWithout sellers accepting bitcoins, it is not going anywhere. For that, you need sellers trust, which will require the first three steps listed above.Once sellers are in, i think this will pretty much be autonomous.Not sure if such goals requires a centralized organisation, but they may need some follow-up.My 0.02 BTC Cool, i'm in again this time Would be nice on your site to have a little chiffred example of what is a pick 3, pick 5, etc, and how are gain redistributed.Something like the first post of this tread, but don't know if the mentionned values are still up to date (didn't read all the posts) Just tried It, seems to works correctly.I just found the interface not so easy to use, i wanted to bet on black, and sometimes had trouble knowing on what to click to be able to bet.It seems you have to close the current draw, not so obvious for me, not native english.Something easier could be made, even if it currently works. I'm one of the people running the proprietary version, even if i yet generated no block.This is the only ready to use binary i found for windows.I can get 21Mh/s with a 8800gt, comparing to 2.2Mhz with a e6750 2.66ghz processor. I would say *10 -10% is better than nothing, that still make a *9 speedup.sure, a *10 speedup would be best :pAny news of a windows version that can get such a speed without compilation ? I have a nvidia card, 8800gt, i can test under windows and why not under linux in virtualbox.Don't hesitate to publish step by test it, or publish a windows binary package, i'm willing to help as i can. Hi,This is my first post here, not sure the subject was not already discussed.The major problem i see with your system is that you propose a system with a total maximum of bitcoin.To claim ownership on bitcoin, you need the right key. Loose the key, you loose your bitcoin.So over time, more and more people will inevitabily loose their hard drive, forget they have btc, shred their wallet.dat ... All these bitcoins will become ghost bitcoin, without any practical mean to get access to it. These ghost bitcoin will become as time pass an increasing proportion of all the bitcoin, until it will be such that is will be a big problem.Is there anything planned to solve this issue ?
