I'm not so sure that banks are required to generate currency to be viable. Banks actually predate the current fiat currency system by several thousand years. I think the underlying principle of banks offering loans is that they hold currency that would otherwise be idle and put it to use, and in exchange will pay interest on the currency deposited, and will present the currency on the demand of a depositor. It's nothing near as sexy and postmodern as creating currency from nothing the way a reserve or a fiat system does, but still probably does have some measure of value to an economy.
