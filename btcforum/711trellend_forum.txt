   I'd like to do that, but I think there are some serious legal issues doing that since I'm 100% USA based.  My own private currency, AspenBux, is just given away in free tournaments, or you can do those paid survey things to get them.  But you can redeem AspenBux for USD also, so it's a fine line I walk.   That's why I stated that you can use it for the virutal goods, and didn't mention playing for it.  Now after I move the op out of USA, it's a different story.  I might pay out in BitCoins later if I get some in the account, but that would require sales, because I'm not going to mine them.  20 hrs of mining, 0.00 coins, and my Host company for the VPS was about to shoot me.  They even killed the container and left it off for an hour as a hint.  I was nice about it too, just set it to 1/4 Cpus.  I normally run 5% cpu at prime time high stakes tournaments, so it was a big change and they noticed...   Illegal = Consideration/Chance/Reward of Value.   Legal is replace one of those with something else.  I keep consideration to Free (none), and Chance to Skill.             Loneaspen.com Online Multiplayer Pool Games and TournamentsI will accept bitcoins for donations (stars) and custom virtual goods in game.  Currently virtual goods are only custom cues sticks (to be used in game), but I will be adding more.Contact Sales@ that address to arrange a transaction.Example Cue:Thankswww.loneaspen.com
