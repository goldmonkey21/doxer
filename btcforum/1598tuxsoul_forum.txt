Hi @stephane-klein sorry i don't have access to any arm arch  , but you can try compile bitcoind.First you can try using git-clone to get the oficial bitcoin in debian:http://git.debian.org/?p=collab-maint/bitcoin.git;a=summaryor you can clone my no oficial code:https://github.com/tuxsoul/bitcoinafter only do: debuild or git-buildpackageIf that work for you, you need wait or send a msg to the debian maintainer to update the code to 0.3.21, if work with my repository code, only need wait two days more o less to get the last code .Any feedback to my repository you can write here.Greeting's. Hi @walidzohair, all packages of bitcoin-cpuminer have 4way SSE2 enable, if you search the last SSE2_64 code from ufasoft enable in bitcoin-cpuminer, only you can find it in ubuntu maverick, natty and oneiric, only in that code names is possible get yasm 1.1.0 to compile SSE2_64.Greeting's.   @nefario: you can use my sources and ubuntu backports maybe, or only the debian directory and check the debian/control file, only is necesary you change maybe the build-depends line, after that, only do debuild or git-buildpackage. +1+1Is not necesary delete tags, i like the tags to know which code is used in the build process.I can help you for debian package:1.- You need a debian system, in this case maybe lenny or squeeze.2.- Follow this guide: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PbuilderHowto     ¿Sure?, yes, this work for debian and ubuntu.3.- Use cowbuilder with pbuilder.4.- Create the sources (.orig.tar.gz, .dsc, .debian.tar.gz), using "dpkg-source -b".5.- And build the packages with cowbuilder.6.- Test your packages.For example, in my slow machine, bitcoin-cpuminer is compiled for five debian versions, using a virtualbox install, the first thing is the source code, after that, is necesary ~2 hour to compile.Prepare the source code (ubuntu and debian)(~2 hour) + Compile (only debian, only i386)(~2 hours) = ~4 hours.Sometimes is very less than 4 hours, and other times is more that 4 hours.Greetings. hi,my website are using ad server, ¿i can use your javascript code in my ad server, to show the ad in my blog?greetings. Hi,I can build the next development version, for debian (sid or wheezy) and ubuntu (natty).What you think ?Greetings. Is not necessary, if exist an official debian package, only is necesary send a request for sync, with that, ubuntu will use the debian package.In other way, i can send my own package to ubuntu revu.example: bitcoin-cpuminer in ubuntu revuhttp://revu.ubuntuwire.com/p/bitcoin-cpuminerGreetings. Hi,If you have a small server, you can check my repository to test bitcoind (not gui).http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2207In the next update i build for: lucid, maverick and natty.Greetings. hi,i can't find that tags, is possible can you tell me which commit is 0.3.20 and 0.3.21 ?greeting's.

Hi,Thanks @jgarzik, bitcoin-cpuminer is ready for debian and ubuntu:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2207.msg48507#msg48507Greeting's. Hi,I glad to say, bitcoin-cpuminer 0.7 (by @jgarzik) is ready for debian and ubuntu.If you are using my repository only use synaptic, apt-get, or aptitude to update  .Greeting's. Good work @adv For lenny in this moment only is possible compile bitcoin-cpuminer, to compile bitcoind is necesary new packages (backports), and for last only  i have two packages in this moment, others bitcoin apps debian packages are in debianize process ...For example, one friend gift me SAPPHIRE X1550 ATI card, maybe i can use that card for test and packaging gpu miners, but, my pc don't have pci-e, i need work to change my pc  .Any feedback or comment are welcome ... Hi,for lenny you need use backports, ex:Code:deb http://deb.tuxsoul.com lenny-backports main contrib non-freedeb-src http://deb.tuxsoul.com lenny-backports main contrib non-freeand append (debian backports):Code:deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports mainOnly to bitcoind
